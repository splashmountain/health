CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**3146-11-28**] 7:48 PM
UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
63 year old woman s/p pericardectomy
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate for effusions
PICC in mid SVC. Relatively unchanged left small and decreased
small right pleural effusions. Similar appearance of pulmonary
vascularity.

[**Numeric Identifier 11989**] PICC W/O PORT  [**3146-11-27**] 7:30 AM
Reason: for iv antibiotics
PROCEDURE NAME: PICC line placement.
INDICATION: IV access needed for antibiotics.
TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the
right brachial vein was punctured under direct ultrasound
guidance using a micropuncture set. Hard copies of ultrasound
images were obtained before and immediately after establishing
intravenous access. A peel-away sheath was then placed over a
guidewire and a double-lumen PICC line measuring 44 cm in length
was then placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip
positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of
the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the
chest. The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed. The
catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile
dressing applied.
The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no
immediate complications.
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided
5 French double-lumen PICC line placement via the right brachial
venous approach. Final internal length is 44 cm, with the tip
positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient. Bilateral pleural effusions.

1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2.There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with mild hypokinesia of the lateral and inferolateral wall.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 45-50 %).
3.Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
There is abnormal septal motion suggestive of pericardial
constriction.
4. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. The
pericardium may be thickened. Pericardial constriction is
present.
8. Post pericardial resection there is reduction in the
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transferred to the CCU after her pericardiocentesis
in a fair condition. She was seen and evaluated by the CCU team
upon her arrival. Since the procedure, she had an improvement in
her dyspnea and pleuritic pain. She was no longer nauseated and
her chest pain was improved with doses of IV morphine. She was
placed on supplemental O2 via nasal canula. Wound site was
hemostatic with no bleeding.

Patient was evaluated for possible causes of pericardial
effusion including infectious causes (Viral EBV, Adenovirus,
HIV, TB, Streptococcus, CMV, [**Doctor Last Name **], ect), malignancy, or
rheumatologic causes.

Her pericardial drain was dc'd on [**11-19**]. She continued on vanco
and zosyn.

She was seen by cardiac surgery for potential pericardiectomy
secondary to contriction. She was taken to the operating room on
[**11-21**] where she underwent a pericardiectomy. She was transferred
to the ICU in critical but stable condition. She was extubated
later that day. She was transferred to the floor on POD #2. She
did well postoperatively.
She was followed closely by infectious diseases who recommended
that she complete a 2 week course of vanco and levo, and await
finalization of her OR cultures. Rheumatology felt that the
effusion was not due to an immune process/RA.
A PICC line was placed on [**11-26**]. ID recommended that she
complete a 2 week course of vanco and levo which she will
receive in [**State 12728**]. The results of a weekly CBC, chemistry
and vanco trough will be sent to her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 21**]. [**First Name (STitle) **]. She will
also follow up with CT surgery at [**Location (un) **] Medical Center in
[**Location (un) 681**].
