Chief Complaint:
abnormal stress test

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p cardiac cathterization with stent on [**3273-2-7**]

History of Present Illness:
77 year old female with DM, COPD, CAD s/p CABG [**3270**], angina and
abnormal stress test at OSH with worsening EF on [**2-3**] presents
for cardiac catheterization.  Patient's cardiac history includes
a silent MI about 15 yrs ago, CP and dyspnea with MI in [**3270**],
s/p CABGx4 by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5229**].  Patient was diagnosed with DM 2 days
prior to admission with blood sugar 300.  Pt was admitted to OSH
last week with CHF.  She was admitted again on [**2-6**] with CHF, BNP
1760, ruled out for MI.  At OSH patient noted to have worsening
EF and she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath.  Patient states she
had CP at rest 5 days prior for 10 minutes and overnight that
night woke up short of breath without CP.  Patient denies
orthopnea.  She has had increasing lower extremity swelling in
the past 4 days and does get short of breath with activity (she
has had PFTs at [**Location (un) **] in past).
     During catheterization patient had an episode of CP,
increased PCWP and hypotension when balloon was inflated, but
this resolved when balloon was deflated.  A small vessel was
perforated and Echo performed but no effusion seen.

[**3273-2-7**] CARDIAC Catheterization
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel native coronary artery disease. Patent SVG-OM3.
Occluded
proximal SVG-D1-OM2 with patent D1-OM2 jump segment. Atretic
LIMA-LAD.
2. Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. PCI of LAD with DES.
COMMENTS: 1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated native
two
vessel coronary artery disease in this right dominant
circulation. The
LMCA had mild disease without flow limitation. The LAD was
heavily
calcified proximally with serial 80% and 90% stenoses in the mid
and
distal vessel. The diagonal had a jump segment of vein graft
that filled
an occluded OM. The LCX had a 50% proximal stenosis. The OM1 was
without
flow limiting disease. The OM2 and OM3 were totally occluded.
The OM2
filled via the jump segment from the diagonal. The OM3 filled
via a
patent vein graft. The RCA had mild luminal irregularities
without flow
limiting disease.
2. Graft angiography demonstrated the SVG-OM3 to be widely
patent. The
SVG-D1-OM2 was totally occluded in the proximal graft with a
patent jump
segment supplying the OM2 via the native diagonal.
3. Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated an atretic LIMA-LAD
with
minimal flow into the LAD.
4. Resting hemodynamics from right and left heart
catheterization
demonstrated elevated right and left filling pressures
(RVEDP=15mmHg,
PCWP=20mmHg, LVEDP=20mmHg). Cardiac output and index were
preserved at
4.9 L/min and 2.8 L/min/m2. Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension
was
present.
5. Left ventriculography was not performed to reduce contrast
load.
6. PCI of LAD with DES.
.
Echocardiogram [**3273-2-8**]:
EF 20%.  The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with relative preservation
of the basal lateral and distal lateral walls and near akinesis
of remaining segments. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Extensive regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse process.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild mitral
regurgitation. No pericardial effusion.

beta-blocker, statin.  Not on ACEI given history of ?renal
failure. Started Captopril, creatinine stable at 1.3 and
transitioned to lisinopril 5 on day of discharge.  Creatinine to
be followed by outpatient PCP and cardiologist.
     Pump: Continued lasix and titrate to goal even to 500 cc
negative.  Rechecked Echo on 1/0/06, EF 20%, mod PA systolic
HTN, no pericardial effusion (results above).  Started Digoxin
0.125.
     Rhythm: NSR, monitor on Telemetry.  Monitor EKGs.
.
2.  DM: newly diagnosed and not on any medications.  Will check
finger sticks and regular insulin sliding scale for now.
Patient required very little insulin, blood sugars 100-170.
Patient to follow with [**Last Name (un) **] at [**Location (un) **].  She is to follow-up
with PCP 5 days after discharge and to schedule an appointment
at the [**Last Name (un) **] in the next week.  She was given a glucometer and
was instructed to test her blood sugars at least once daily and
call her PCP if blood sugars > 300.
.
3.  Pulm: Patient with COPD, not currently wheezing.  Continue
advair.
.
4.  FEN: low salt/heart healthy/diabetic diet.  Monitor
electrolytes and repleted prn.
.
5.  Proph: ambulate, PT to see pt prior to discharge.
.
6.  Dispo: Patient to receive VNA at home for Diabetes teaching.
 She is to test blood sugars at least once daily.  She has
follow-up scheduled next week with both her PCP and her
