Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 69**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo woman with h/o CAD, CHF (baseline EF 45%), breast CA, DVT,
AFib on Coumadin, who presents with hypotension.  She has a home
health aide who lives with her 24/7 and thought that the patient
seemed altered this morning.  Her speech was slurred and her BP
was in the 70s.  She also has a lot of bruising on her arms and
face, so there's a concern for elder abuse (from PCP).
.
In the ED, her initial vs were: T 97.3, P 85, BP 80/46, R 16, O2
95% on RA. She triggered for hypotension and was given 1L of
IVF, to which her BP increased to 88/46.  Per review of OMR, her
BP typically ranges from 80-90.  She had a CXR, which
demonstrated a ? right-sided PNA.  She was given Ceftriaxone,
Levaquin, and Vanc.  The resident in the ED spoke with both of
her daughters about her code status, and she is DNR/DNI with
non-invasive measures only (no central line).  She was ordered
for a CT-neck, abdomen, pelvis, given the concern for elder
abuse, but she had not yet received them in the ED.  Trop 0.37,
EKG showed AFib with RBBB, ST depressions in V2 and V3 that are
new and no ST elevations.  She got an ASA in the ED.  Her VS at
the time of transfer were T 97.2, 88/46, 80, 14, 98% on 2L.

.
Influenza DFA [**2599-1-19**]: negative for influenza A, B
.
Imaging:
CXR [**1-18**]: Increased interstitial markings bilaterally are
suggestive of interstitial edema. Superimposed infectious
process cannot be excluded.
.
LUE U/S [**1-18**]: No evidence of left upper extremity DVT. Left
cephalic and basilic veins not visualized.
.
CT Head [**2599-1-18**]: No acute intracranial abnormalities.

CT C-spine [**2599-1-18**]: No fracture or change in alignment. If there
is clinical concern
for ligamentous or cord injury, MRI is more sensitive for this.
.
CT Abd/pelvis [**2599-1-18**]:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. Redemonstration of pleural effusions and bibasilar
atelectasis. inflammatory change on prior study has resolved.
3. Cholelithiasis, with no evidence of cholecystitis.
4. Sigmoid diverticula with no evidence of diverticulitis.
5. Diffuse vascular calcifications.
6. Diffuse spinal degenerative change.
 .
[**2599-1-19**] Echo: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferior and
inferolateral walls. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 40%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-23**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Severe aortic valve stenosis.
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
Bilateral Knee X-rays [**2599-1-19**]:
1. No evidence of acute fracture or dislocation of the left
knee. Left knee chondrocalcinosis.
2. Suboptimal evaluation of the right knee as only a lateral
view was obtained. The patella appears slightly low lying. No
obvious fracture is seen, although evaluation is suboptimal. If
clinical concern for right knee fracture persists, suggest
attempt at repeat imaging or cross-sectional imaging.
.
CXR (PA & Lat) [**2599-1-21**]: The most significant abnormality in the
chest developing over the past three days has been increased in
moderate right pleural effusion and the development of new
consolidation in a region of scarring in the right upper lobe.
The latter could be pneumonia, or alternatively edema developing
in a region of previous injury by radiation. A region of lesser
consolidation at the left apex looks more like scarring and
others at both lung bases are probably
atelectasis. The slightly smaller left pleural effusion has also
increased. Severe cardiomegaly is chronic. The extremely dilated
upper esophagus is responsible for a central lucency in the neck
and upper mediastinum. The patient has a history of extensive
bone metastases and destruction of the sternum with soft tissue
infection that can be evaluated by conventional radiographs.
Thoracic aorta is heavily calcified, tortuous and unchanged
recently. No pneumothorax.
.
Right Knee X-ray [**2599-1-21**]: There is chondrocalcinosis. There is
no knee joint effusion.
There is generalized demineralization which limits evaluation
for subtle fractures; however no definite fractures are seen. No
focal lytic or blastic lesions are present. If there is high
clinical concern for nondisplaced fracture or acute
intra-articular pathology, MRI could be performed.
.
CXR [**2599-1-24**] (prelim read): Worsening of right upper lobe and
right lower lobe consolidation
concerning for pneumonia. Stable small right greater than left
pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo woman with h/o CAD, CHF (baseline EF 45%), breast CA, DVT,
AFib on Coumadin, who presented with hypotension in the setting
of possible acute on chronic sternal wound
infection/osteomyelitis and pneumonia.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
.
#. Hypotension: Patient's hypotension was felt to be most likely
secondary to sepsis, from worsening of sternal wound infection
vs. pneumonia. Hypotension was also likely related to decreased
fluid intake at home.  Her BP responded to IVF administration in
the ED, and she was initially admitted to the ICU for further
evaluation.  Per patient/family wishes, she did not have a
central line placed for pressor support, given goals of care and
wish for non-invasive measures.  She was started on broad
spectrum antibiotics, with subsequent downward trend in
leukocytosis.  [**Age over 90 **] cultures were negative.  ID consulted, and
followed closely (see below).   Her home BP meds were initially
held, but lasix and spironolactone were restarted prior to
discharge (see below).  BP stabilized, and SBP remained stable
generally in the 100s-110s leading up to discharge.
.
#. Acute on Chronic Osteomyelitis/sternal wound: Patient was on
avelox at home for suppressive therapy, and it was felt her
hypotension and leukocytosis on admission may be secondary to
acute on chronic osteomyelitis.  Wound swab culture demonstrated
polymicrobial infection, including enterococcus and
corynebacterium species.  The patient was followed closely by
the Infectious Disease team, and continued on vanc/cefepime for
broad spectrum antibiotic coverage until time of discharge.  She
was discharged on moxifloxacin 400mg PO daily, given goals of
care and desire for oral regimen.  Wound care was also consulted
for recommendations about daily dressing changes. While the
definitive treatment for this wound is surgical, the patient and
family have declined surgical repair.
.
#. Pneumonia: Patient initially started on broad spectrum
antibiotics with vanc/ceftriaxone/azithro given concern for PNA
on presentation.  Her antibiotics were later switched to
vanc/cefepime as above.  While evidence of pneumonia was not
clearly demonstrated on initial CXR, subsequent CXR demonstrated
worsening RUL pneumonia.  The patient had a speech and swallow
evaluation during this admission, which revealed she is
intermittently aspirating.  Given increased cough, rales on lung
exam, and rising leukocytosis at time of worsening radiographic
evidence of PNA, the patient was also started on flagyl as there
was concern for aspiration PNA.  The patient and her family are
aware of the risks of continued aspiration should she continue
to eat/drink, but they did not want to make her NPO or pursue
alternate nutrition.  She was discharged home to hospice care
and will continue to take moxifloxacin as above, but was not
discharged on any additional antibiotics.  The patient's O2
requirement ranged from 2-3L NC during this admission, and the
patient will be set up with home oxygen.  It is also likely that
worsening pleural effusions  (see below) were contributing to
oxygen requirement.
.
#. CHF: Patient's most recent echo in our system from [**2595**]
showed EF 40-45%.  Repeat echo this admission showed LVEF of 40%
and severe aortic stenosis, similar findings compared to TTE in
[**2595**].  The patient's lasix, spironolactone, carvedilol were
initially held in setting of hypotension.  Serial CXRs
demonstrated increasing pleural effusions after diuretics were
held, and the patient also developed lower extremity edema.
Given concern that increased fluid was contributing to cough,
SOB, and hypoxia, the patient was restarted on Lasix  at half
the home dose, and spironolactone at full dose prior to
discharge.  She will have home oxygen.
.
#. Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient's Cr was elevated
from baseline of 1.5 to 2.5 on admission, likely secondary to
pre-renal etiology in the setting of hypotension and
dehydration.  Her Cr improved throughout her hospital course,
and was back to baseline at 1.4 on day of discharge.
.
#. CAD: The patient has a history of MI, last cath [**5-26**] with
3VD, s/p PCI of the LMCA/LAD/LCX with DES. Trop elevated to 0.37
on admission, EKG showed new ST depressions in V2 and V3;
concerning for NSTEMI vs demand ischemia in the setting of
hypotension.  Cards consulted, repeat EKG improved, likely lead
placement on the first EKG.  Repeat trop stable.  She was given
aspirin and continued on a statin.  Echo showed LVEF of 40% and
severe aortic stenosis which is similar findings compared to TTE
in [**2595**].  Of note, aspirin and statin stopped on discharge,
given goals of care.
.
#. ? Elder abuse: PCP had concern about abuse due to bruises on
face/arms, possibly from home care nurse.  The patient had a CT
head, c-spine, and abd/pelvis, which were all negative for any
acute process.  To be safe, the family will have a new home care
provider.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 22433**] work followed along closely.  Of note, it is
also possible that increased bruising was secondary to warfarin
use, and INR was supratherapeutic at time of admission.
.
#. AFib and h/o DVT: Patient's INR was supratherapeutic on
admission, and warfarin was initially held.  She did receive
several doses of warfarin during this admission, but warfarin
will not be continued on discharge given goals of care.  PCP
aware of this decision, and in agreement.
.
#. Knee Pain: Patient complained of intermittent knee pain
during the admission, likely secondary to arthritis.  X-rays did
not show evidence of acute fracture.  The patient was started on
standing tylenol for pain relief.
.
#. LFT elevation: ALT has been elevated in the past, AST
slightly more elevated.  The patient did not complain of
abdominal pain or tenderness, and CT abdomen showed gallstones
but no acute process.
.
#. HTN: Patient's carvedilol, lasix, and spironolactone were
initially held in the setting of hypotension.  Lasix and
spironolactone were restarted prior to discharge as above, but
carvedilol was not restarted.
.
INACTIVE ISSUES:
.
#. Hypercholesterolemia: Continued home simvastatin, but this
was stopped at time of discharge given goals of care.
.
#. Hypothyroidism: Continued home levothyroxine.
.
#. Depression: Continued home citalopram, ropinirole.

PENDING AT TIME OF DISCHARGE: Official read of [**2599-1-24**] portable
CXR
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-She should continue to have daily dressing changes for her
sternal wound.
-She is at risk for aspiration, and should be monitored closely
with all meals.  To reduce the risk of aspiration, a diet of
soft pureed foods and nectar pre-thickened liquids is best.  The
patient and her family are aware of the risks of aspiration,
should she continue to eat/drink.
-Patient's code status was DNR/DNI during this admission, and
patient/family do not wish for aggressive measures.
-Patient discharged home with hospice care.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **],

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay at [**Hospital1 1240**].  You were admitted to the
hospital with some confusion and low [**Hospital1 118**] pressures, likely due
to an infection in your sternal wound and a pneumonia.  We
treated you with fluids and antibiotics, and you improved.  You
required oxygen, and you will be set up with oxygen at home to
help with your breathing.

A speech and swallow evaluation showed you are aspirating small
amounts of food/drink into your lungs while you are eating,
which may contribute to pneumonia.  You were continued on a diet
of soft foods and thick liquids to minimize this from happening,
but there is still a chance you may develop another pneumonia.

We made the following changes to your medications:
1. STOPPED coumadin
2. DECREASED lasix to 40mg once daily
3. STOPPED carvediolol
4. STOPPED ferrous sulfate
5. STOPPED simvastatin
6. STARTED tylenol 1000mg three times per day
7. STARTED oxyfast as needed for pain or shortness of breath

You should continue on moxifloxacin 400mg daily for your wound.
Please continue to take all other medications as you have been
doing.  Your primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2455**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] is aware
you are being discharged from the hospital, and you may contact
her if you have any questions about your medications.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow-up with your primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2455**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], as needed.  The clinic number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10314**].
