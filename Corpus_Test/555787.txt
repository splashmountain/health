History of Present Illness
   - cath with bare metal stent to R PDA
   - CXR showed mild CHF, R effusion, nodules likely malignancy
   - echo for tomorrow ordered
   - talked to pt's oncologist's coverage; OK to hold aromatase inhibitor
   until outpatient follow-up with him
   - shortly after cath, afib with RVR to 130s-->5 mg lopressor IV x 1-->
   BP fell to 73/57.  Planned to give digoxin .25 q6 x 4 doses, but afib
   spontaneously broke to NSR 80's, SBP rose to 100.  No further tx given
   - pt had a coughing/choking fit, O2 sat fell into 70s but unclear if
   this was an accurate, lungs clear, patient suctioned and improved
   within 2-3 minutes, O2 Sat high 90s
   -post-cath check unremarkable
   -npo p MN in case needs cardioversion

   ABG: 7.49 / 33 / 62 /  / 2   Values as of [**2809-1-13**] 03:00 PM
   Echo: The left atrium is elongated. The interatrial septum is
   aneurysmal. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
   There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
   ventricular cavity size is normal. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
   left ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
   depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %) with mid to distal septal and
   inferior/infero-lateral hypokinesis. There is no ventricular septal
   defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
   effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   89 yr old pt with h/o CAD s/p stenting, a-fib on warfarin and
   dofetilide, presented last night to OSH with CHF exacerbation, was
   found to have NSTEMI, transferred to [**Hospital1 17**] for cath per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 155**], found
   to be in polymorphic VT upon arrival from OSH, transferred to CCU,
   started on isoproterenol.
   .
   # RHYTHM: History of afib on dofetilide. Had frequent runs of
   polymorphic VT with no symptoms on floor, broke with isoproterenol gtt.
   Likely induced by dofetilide in setting of cardiac ischemia and reduced
   renal clearance (Cr 1.1, unclear baseline).  Now off dofetilide and
   isoproterenol, s/p run of afib with RVR after cath, now in NSR.
   - metoprolol for rate control; avoid bradycardia, which might trigger
   PMVT again
   - avoid any drugs that might prolong QT interval
   - telemetry
   - on heparin gtt now; will restart warfarin
   - keep K > 4.0, Mg > 2.0 (check TID)
   .
   # CORONARIES:  NSTEMI at OSH, s/p cath with bare metal stent yesterday
   to R PDA
   - clopidogrel for 1 month
   - cont heparin gtt, aspirin, atorvastatin
   .
   # PUMP: chronic CHF, unknown EF.   Does not appear overloaded on exam.
   Echo with EF 40-45% with mid to distal septal and inferior/lateral
   hypokinesis
   - monitor I/O
   - restart furosemide
   .
   # Breast cancer: with mets to pleura. On hormonal therapy; no chemo or
   xrt.  Per conversation with oncologist coverage, OK to not restart
   aromatase inhibitor (side effect of cardiac ischemia) until outpt f/u.
   .
   # HTN: stable BP now
   - will restart [**Last Name (un) **] tomorrow if BP stable
   .
   # FEN:  cardiac, heart healthy diet
   .
   # ACCESS: PIV's
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS: on hep gtt
   .
   # CODE: FULL, confirmed with patient
