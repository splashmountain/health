Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Normal interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple
atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Physiologic TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient. Results were reviewed with the
Cardiology Fellow involved with the patient's care. See
Conclusions for post-bypass data The post-bypass study was
performed while the patient was receiving vasoactive infusions
(see Conclusions for listing of medications).
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine.
1. Biventricular systolic function is preserved.
2. MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9985**].
3. Aorta is intact post decannulation
4. Other findings are [**Last Name (Titles) 9985**]


Brief Hospital Course:
He was taken to the operating room where he underwent a CABG x
3. He was transferred to the ICU in stable condition. He was
extubated later that same day. He was transferred to the floor
on POD #1. He did well postoperatively. His Chest tubes were
removed. Post cxr showed no sequele. POD 3 # Pacing wires were
removed.
PT worked with pt. Pt stable for DC.

To note pt did fail voiding trial. He is urinating on DC
