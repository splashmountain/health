further evaluation.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. COPD exacebation with acute respiratory failure: Treateed
with solumedrol 125mg IV x 1, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and
nebulizers. Prednisone 60 mg was given once then started 40 mg

decreased during her stay such that she had returned to her
baseline on discharge. Nasopharyngeal swab for viral antigens
was negative.
