   Imaging: [**2772-5-1**] CXR: FINDINGS: Single bedside AP examination labeled
   "upright at 18:50" is
   compared with study dated [**2772-1-28**]; the overall appearance is not much
   changed.
   There are bilateral pleural effusions with chronic pleural abnormality
   involving the left hemithorax, and associated atelectasis. Allowing for
   this,
   no focal consolidation is seen. There is cardiomegaly with LV
   enlargement,
   but no pulmonary vascular congestion or acute edema. There are
   arteriosclerotic changes involving the thoracic aorta.
   IMPRESSION: Chronic changes, with no definite acute airspace process
