   IMAGING:
   [**2861-12-22**] ECHO:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. A septal occluder device is seen across the interatrial septum
   with small amount of persistent interatrial shunting (direction of the
   shunt difficult to pinpoint based on this study). . A small secundum
   atrial septal defect is present. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
   cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   low normal (LVEF 55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
   diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
   volume overload. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
   arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
   (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully coapt.
   Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined, but is likely elevated given
   high right atrial pressures and RV volume overload. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with mild global systolic
   dysfunction and volume overload. Low-normal left ventricular systolic
   function. Severe tricuspid regurgitation. Amplatzer-type atrial septal
   occluder with trace residual shunting.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2861-9-30**], right
   ventricle is slightly smaller. LV function does not appear as vigorous
   and LV cavity is slightly larger, possibly in part due to better
   filling. The other findings are similar.
   [**2861-12-22**] Renal U/S (prelim)
   Limited portable examination due to patient body habitus. No
   hydronephrosis of the right or left kidney. Doppler assessment of renal
   vessels suboptimal.
   Assessment and Plan
   63 year old woman with severe diastolic heart failure, severe tricuspid
   regurgitation presenting with decompensated heart failure in the
   setting of medication non compliance, admitted to CCU for initiation of
   ultrafiltration.
   .
   # ACUTE DECOMPENSATED DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Patient not responding
   to intravenous diuretics, now day 2 of ultrafiltration for diuresis.
   Etiology of diastolic dysfunction unknown: consider infiltrative
   disease especially with evidence of nephrotic range proteinuria (see
   below)
   -- continue UF
   -- d/c diuretics while pt receiving CVVHD
   -- TTE repeated, no significant change from the last echo, no evidence
   of amyloidosis.
   .
   # CORONARIES: No history of CAD
   - ASA 81mg
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt with a-fib. Not on anti-coagulation given history of
   severe GI bleed.  Has significant bradycardia, although asymptomatic
   no confusion, dizziness, chest pain
   - continue to hold b blocker
   - monitor on tele
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: Pt with baseline 1.2-1.4. On
   admission 1.8 and increased to 2.1 with diuresis and poor forward
   flow.  However, patient only with minimal urine output with lasix gtt
   and metolazone. Started on UF for volume removal.  U/A with nephrotic
   range proteinuria and significant edema.  Possible etiologies include
   amyloidosis, multiple myeloma, minimal change disease, other causes
   glomerular nephrosis. Cr currently at baseline
 1.3.
   -- f/u renal recs
   -- f/u SPEP/ UPEP, albumin/ creatinine ratio
   -- f/u lipid panel
   -- renal U/S
 prelim no hydronephrosis, limited study
   -- avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - consider necessity of kidney/ heart or fat pad biopsy if suspicion
   for amyloidosis remains high
   .
   # UC: Patient w/ hx of Ulcerative Colitis. Pt with loose stools.
   - cont mesalamine 800mg TID
   - guaiac stools
   .
   #. Anemia: Hct 23, slowly trending down. Likely combination of anemia
   [**2-7**] renal failure and possible GI loss given prior history.

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.
