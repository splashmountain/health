Service:  Medicine, [**Hospital1 11006**] Firm

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
African-American female with a history of hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease,
cerebrovascular accident, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and
severe dementia who presents with a upper respiratory
infection initially to the [**Hospital6 2688**] Clinic on
[**10-17**] and given azithromycin times five days.  The
patient was otherwise, she was in her usual state of health.

On Saturday ([**10-19**]) in the evening, the patient was
noted to have a large hard stool with dark blood.  On Sunday
morning, she had no blood in her diaper when changed but by
the evening (at 6 p.m.) she had a large blood clot and dark
blood saturating her diaper.  The patient had no nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, or hematemesis.

In the Emergency Department, the patient's vital signs
revealed a heart rate of 77, her blood pressure was 132/44,
and her oxygen saturation was 97% on room air.   Her
hematocrit was 27.8 (with a baseline of 35.3 in [**2633-10-19**]) with normal platelets and coagulations.

The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells.
A tagged red blood cell scan showed an active hepatic
flexure bleed.  The patient went to angiogram for a possible
embolization and was found to have a total superior
mesenteric artery and internal mammary artery occlusion with
no possible embolization intervention.  Her hematocrit was
stabilized after a total of 3 units of packed red blood cells
were transfused.  She was watched in the Medical Intensive
Care Unit, and her hematocrit on [**10-22**] at 4 a.m. was 29%
and remained in that range on [**10-23**].  She continued to
ooze some blood from her rectal tube.

The patient's two daughters have expressed the desire for no
surgery or heroic measures.  The patient's code status was to
remain do not resuscitate/do not intubate.  The patient was
transferred to the floor initially for observation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed the patient's temperature was 96.7 degrees
Fahrenheit, temperature maximum was 96.7, her heart rate was
53 to 72, and her blood pressure was 135 to 167/48 to 58.
Generally, the patient was in no acute distress.  She opened
her eyes and was moaning.  She was not communicative but was
alert and at her baseline.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat examination revealed the mucous membranes were moist.
There was no jugular venous distention.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  There was
[**2-21**] holosystolic murmur at the apex.  Pulmonary examination
revealed the lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There
were normal active bowel sounds.  There was no
hepatosplenomegaly.  The extremities were without edema.  She
had contracture of all four extremities.  Neurologically, she
had increased tone in her left upper extremity and left lower
extremity.  She was moving all extremities well.  Her
reflexes were equal bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed her white blood cell count was 10, her hematocrit
was 30, and her platelets were 132.  The patient's sodium was
142, potassium was 4.4, chloride was 112, bicarbonate was 22,
blood urea nitrogen was 17, creatinine was 0.5, and her blood
glucose was 103.  Her calcium was 8.2, her phosphate was 2.6,
and her magnesium was 2.1.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A tagged red cell scan on
[**10-21**] showed an active hepatic flexure bleed.

Angiography revealed total occlusion of the superior
mesenteric artery and internal mammary artery with celiac
collateral feeding superior mesenteric artery territory.  No
possible embolization.

An esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2631-4-11**] showed normal
esophagus, gastric, and duodenum.

A colonoscopy on [**2631-4-11**] showed multiple diverticula
in the entire colon, three polyps in the ascending colon
(status post polypectomy), and no active bleeding.

A chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and increased interstitial
markings.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED ISSUES:  Gastrointestinal bleed
localized to the hepatic flexure with a tagged red blood cell
scan.  The patient's was stabilized in the Intensive Care
Unit initially with a transfusion and was then transferred
out to the floor.  She had total superior mesenteric artery
and internal mammary artery occlusion, and no embolization
was possible by angiography.

The family declined any surgery or other heroic measures, and
she continued to have bleeding after transfer out of the
Intensive Care Unit, requiring four to six transfusions per
day.  The bleeding had slowed by [**10-28**].  After having a
family discussion with both of her daughters and the
attending, her daughters understood that she would likely
continue to bleed at home but there may be no other
noninvasive interventions possible in the hospital.  Her
daughters understood this and elected to take her home.

2.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient with a
troponin leak.  There were no electrocardiogram changes.
Initially, her hematocrit was kept around 30%, but the
patient remained transfusion dependent.

3.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  Congestive heart
failure was well compensated with an ejection fraction of
about 45%.  The patient was gently hydrated during her
hospital stay and treated with packed red blood cells without
any evidence of fluid overload.

4.  JOINT CONTRACTURE ISSUES:  The patient had contractures
of all four extremities and was treated with physical therapy
as an inpatient.

5.  HYPERTENSION ISSUES:  The patient's blood pressure
medications were held in the setting of an active bleed.

6.  CODE STATUS ISSUES:  The patient remained do not
resuscitate/do not intubate during her hospital stay.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was guarded.

CODE STATUS ON DISCHARGE:  The patient to remain do not
resuscitate/do not intubate, and her family understood her
risk at home of continued bleeding.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home in the
care of her two daughters.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:   The patient was instructed
to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 19314**] [**Name (STitle) **] and was to call for an
appointment (telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 19**]).

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Pantoprazole 40 mg by mouth once
per day.
