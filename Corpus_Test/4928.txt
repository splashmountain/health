History of Present Illness:
61 male with history of seizure disorder, nonischemic
cardiomyopathy EF 20-30%, ESRD on HD (T/Th/Sat, last session on
saturday), hepatitis B, CAD, CVA, recent admission for line
bacteremia given vanco for 2 week course, who was at his rehab
center and found to be febrile with altered mental status and
hypoglycemia. His sugars there were in the 30s and he was given
oral glucose which improved his finger stick to 156. His
baseline mental status is A+0x3 but today he was A+O x2.
.
Pt had recent admission in [**1-/3164**] for staph epidermidis and
CONS bacteremia, thought to be from tunnel line (tunnel tip grew
CONS). At that time, tunnel line was changed ([**3164-1-13**], fluro
guided tunnel line, exchanged over wire). Pt was given
vancomycin for 2 week course, dosed per HD protocol.
.
In the ED inital vitals were, T 102.2 HR 105 BP 94/44 RR 18 pOx
98% 2L. Tm 104.
Pt noted to have pus coming out of his tunnel line on left. His
temp spiked at 104, SBP initialy 160s.  Tunnel line culture was
sent off.
AAOx2 (not to location).
Patient was given 4L NS, MAPs dropped to the low 60s, placed
femoral line (goal was to preserve other sites sinec pt likely
currently bactermic and will likely need new line), started
levophed infusion 0.06 (BP 94/45).
For fever of 104, given rectal tylenol 650mg, linezolid 600mg,
zosyn 4.5 (not given vanco bc history of VRE).
Cultures were obtained including blood, urine, HD catheter swab.
Labs were significant for CBC WBC 11.9, Hgb 9.4, HCT 31, PLT
366. N 88%. INR 1.3, PTT 34. Phos low at 1.6, Mg 2, Ca 9.7.
Lytes revealed UA: large euks, blood, 300+ protein, sh 1013, pH
6.5.
Na 135, K 5.1, Cl 94, Bicarb 25, BUN 33, Cr 8.2, Gluc 107. AG
was 16. Lactate 2.3.
ABG: pH 7.43, CO2 41, O2 58, HCO3 28
CXR showed: no signs of pneumonia, mildly increased pulm
vascular pressures.
Access includes 18G right and left forearm and right neck.
Femoral line and tunnel line.

Studies:
[**3164-2-24**]   Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Mild cephalization which could reflect mild pulmonary venous
congestion.

[**3164-2-25**] Cardiovascular ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 55%) with
subtle basal inferior hypokinesis. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**3164-1-9**], the LVEF has improved.

[**3164-2-26**] Radiology KNEE 2 VIEW PORTABLE RI
There are degenerative changes with narrowing of the lateral
compartment which causes valgus angulation at the knee. There is
spurring at the inferior pole of the patella. There is no joint
effusion. There are no focal lytic or blastic lesions. There is
some soft tissue swelling.

[**3164-2-27**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
HD catheter has been removed. There is no evident pneumothorax.
If any there is a small right pleural effusion. Cardiac size is
top normal. The aorta is tortuous. The chin of the patient
obscures the right apex. There is mild vascular congestion.
There are no new abnormalities from [**2-24**]. There are low
lung volumes. Widened mediastinum and deviation of the trachea
towards the right is due to enlarged thyroid gland. Multiple
left rib fractures are noted.


Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is 61 male with history of seizure disorder, nonischemic
cardiomyopathy EF 20-30%, ESRD on HD (T/Th/Sat, last session
saturday), hepatitis B, CAD, CVA, several admissions in the past
for tunnel associated MSSA/CONS/VRE bacteremia, recent admission
1 month ago for Staph epidermidis and CONS line bacteremia given
vanco for 2 week course, who presented with MRSA bacteremia
likely due to an infected tunnel line.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
SEPTIC SHOCK: The patient persented with Fever (Tm 104),
Leukocytosis (WBC 12), Tachycardia (HR 100s), lactate 2.3,
mental status change, and BP 94/44 on low dose Levophed and
after 4L, consistent with septic shock. Methicillin resistant
staph aureus grew from the [**5-6**] blood culture bottles, swab of
the catheter and culture of the tip of the catheter line.  Pus
was noted surrounding the catheter site which was evaluated by
general surgery and no I/D indicated.  His urine culture
revealed no growth despite large amount of leukocytes. His
presenting chest xray was clear and joint fluid analysis of his
right knee was not consistent with septic arthritis. A TTE
demonstrated no evidence of vegetations. A TEE was deferred
given it would not change antibiotic duration. He briefly
required pressor support with levophed via a femoral line placed
in the ED. He was initially started on linezolid which was
discontinued in favor of vancomycin and zosyn in the intensive
care unit which were narrowed to vancomycin alone when culture
data was available.  His HD was line was removed and he HD was
deferred for 1 week before a temporary femoral line was placed.
Surveillance blood cultures were all negative following his
admission cultures on [**3164-2-24**].  Duration of therapy 6 weeks
([**0-0-**]) with vancomycin to be given with HD. A
tunneled right subclavian line was placed prior to discharge.
.
ESRD: T/Th/Sat. Last HD prior to admission was 2 days PTA, on
Saturday. HD was deferred for as long as possible, to allow for
a line holiday given segnificant bacteremia and sepsis. Patient
was monitored on telemetry, electrolytes checked daily, small
boluses of fluid given for hypotension. HD cath pulled [**2-24**].
line was replaced on [**2-28**], w/ HD on [**2-29**], now back on prior
Tu/Th/Sat schedule.
.
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Patient is significantly altered from
baseline. Initially, AMS felt to be due to hypoglycemia. Likely
multifactorial--  septic shock, uremia.  Per patient??????s family,
his mental status has been declining for >1 year. Neuro exam non
focal. Patient had one witnessed seizure on the day of HD (5
days into admission), and it was discovered that he had been
under dosed on his keppra during the admission.  It is possible
that he has been having seizures during this time that have been
affecting his MS, however, his postictal state is not similar to
his mental status throughout the admission. Mental status
continued to improved. RPR negative. B12 and folate wnl. TSH
wnl. Head CT in [**3163-10-3**] demonstrated expected expected
age-related changes. [**Month (only) 115**] consider neurocognitive testing in the
outpatient setting.
.
HYPOGLYCEMIA: Likely [**3-5**] acute infectious state. Can also see in
renal failure (because insulin cleared by kidneys), hypopit (pt
has known pituitary mass), adrenal insuf (had normal cortisol Am
level check on prior admission), insulinoma. Most likely
etiology is sepsis. TSH WNL. Patient's blood glucose WNL after 1
day into admission.
.
SEIZURE DISORDER: Patient is on oxcarbazepine and keppra as an
outpatient. Patient was underdosed Keppra during his HD vacation
this admission. He experienced a brief localized seizure
consisting of 1 minute of facial twitching 5 days into
admission. Pt was apparently on the incorrect seizure
medication, which was per his prior d/c summary and outside
facility list (was ~ [**2-4**] of his appropriate dose [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**3163-7-3**]
neuro note). Pt??????s prior seizures were more generalized, last
documented in [**3162**], attributed to medication non-compliance.
Neurology was consulted and Pt was restarted on Keppra 500 tid
plus 500 mg dose after HD, and oxcarbazepine 300 mg tid plus 300
mg dose after HD. Pt apparently tends to have seizures after HD.
Pt states that he typically has a small facial seizure every few
months. Pt did not have any further seizures during his
hospitalization.
.
ANION GAP METABOLIC ACID: Likely [**3-5**] lactic acidosis and renal
failure. Gap closed as patient restarted on HD 5 days into
admission.
.
CAD/CHF: Mild pulm edema on CXR, however on exam pt appears
mildly volume down with some decreased skin turgor. Pt given
several liters of IVF in setting of septic shock. He is at risk
for pulmonary edema so will trend his O2 requirement and exam
closely. HD was restarted 5 days into admission, which will
manage volume status. Continued home simvastatin and ASA, and
digoxin dosed according to HD.
.
ANEMIA: HCT baseline 27-30. HCT currently 31, at baseline.
Likely multifactorial: anemia [**3-5**] ESRD and anemia of chronic
disease. He was given epoeitin in dialysis.
.
INR 1.3: Likely [**3-5**] poor nutrition, recent antibiotics. No
diarrhea. INR trended. He was given vitamin K prior to discharge
.
HYPOPHOSPHOTEMIA: Phos 1.9 on admission (repleted), lower then
expected given renal failure. Pt is sp parathyroidectomy.
Differential includes poor nutrition, osetomalacia, diuretics,
hyper-parathyropidism, hyperthyroidism, recovery from
starvation, steroids. Baseline phos is usualy [**3-7**]. Repeat Phos
levels remained WNL. TSH WNL, PTH high.
.
RIGHT KNEE PAIN. Pt was complaining about knee effusion, which
felt warm and was tapped by orthopedic service. Fluid showed 200
WBC, 1625 RBC, 81% Polys 17% Lymphs, no organisms on gram stain,
no crystals. Pt was treated with analgesics with improvement in
his pain.
