Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 173**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2999-3-5**] Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 4 (Left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft
to diagonal, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal, saphenous
vein graft to posterior descending artery)

History of Present Illness:
76 y/o male s/p abnormal stress test in [**3-4**] in which patient
refused further work-up. Pt. underwent total knee replacement
complicated by multiple pulmonary embolisms and myocardial
infarction. Patient now reports dyspnea on exertion and fatigue.
Finally underwent cardiac cath which revealed severe three
vessel disease. Referred for cardiac surgery.

Past Medical History:
Hyperlipidemia, Myocardial Infarction, Multiple Pulmonary
Emboli, Inguinal hernia, s/p Appendectomy, s/p Tonsillectomy,
s/p Left total knee replacement

Social History:
Retired carpenter. Quit smoking 30 yrs ago after 1ppd x 20 yrs.
Occasional ETOH use.

Family History:
Siblings with "heart surgery".

Physical Exam:
VS: 61 137/64 5'[**05**]" 200lbs
Gen: No acute distress
Skin: Unremarkable
HEENT: Unremarkable
Neck: Supple, full range of motion
Chest: Cleart bilaterally
Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, -murmur
Abd: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, +Bowel sounds
Ext: Warm, well-perfused, -edema
Neuro: Grossly intact, alert and oriented x 3

Pertinent Results:
[**3004-3-5**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion. POST-BYPASS: The patient is A
paced and on an infusion of phenylephrine. Biventricular
function is preserved. The aorta is intact. Mitral regurgitation
is now trivial. The remainder of the examination is unchanged.
[**3004-3-7**] Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6655**] was a same day admit and was brought directly to the
operating room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft
x 4. Please see operative report for surgical details. Following
surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op
day one he appeared to be doing well and was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further care. Chest tubes and epicardial
pacing wires we removed per protocol. A small to moderate
pneumothorax was noted on the post chest tube pull Xray. It was
followed serially and has been stable. The patient has been
asymptomatic and oxygen saturations 92% on roomair. Will reamin
on lsix for 7 days or until back to pre-op weight of 88kg.
Patient was seen by physical therapy and rehab was recommended.
