Chief Complaint:  Unresponsive
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   61 yo male with CAD, CHF at home talking with his wife.
   Abruptly became less responsive- head fell back and minimal respiratory
   effort. No dysarthria/focal weakness
   911 called. [**Name (NI) **] son lowered him to floor and began CPR for [**2-1**]
   minutes, unclear if pt truly lost pulse. +urinary incontinence noted,
   no tonic clonic mov'ts
   Upon EMS arrival, pt beginning to respond. Had pulse, further VS not
   available. Received fluids and had improving MS by the time he arrived
   to ED.
   In ED: Rectal temp 100, P95, 113/83, R13, 100% NRB. WBC 15. Head CT
   unremarkable. UDS negative. Had asymmetric LE edema so obtained CTA
   which was negative- wife later reported this has been chronic. Seen by
   Neuro who felt primary epileptic foci unlikely. Received 2 liters
   fluid, Vanc/CTX
   Pt now more alert, but minimal memory of above events. Denies preceding
   symptoms, including F/C/cough/CP/palpitations/SOB/TIA symptoms. No new
   changes in medicines.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo male with acute episode of unresponsiveness and confusion, though
   improving. Unclear etiology. Given quick resolution, diff dx includes:
   arrhythmia, TIA (though no other sx's pointing to this). Given pt's
   medicine profile combining BP meds with midodrine and hx of labile BP,
   possible he became briefly hypotensive.
   *r/o MI; continue ASA/simvastatin
   *Have PM/ICD interrogated in morning
   *Echo if no significant arrhythmia
   * EEG if cardiac w/u unrevealing
   Left foot ulcer/cellulitis - ?OM given depth of wound
   *On vanc coverage
   Hypotension- Decreased since arrival here-
   *received fluid resuscitation and will monitor
   *Hold BP meds
