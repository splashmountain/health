Pulmonary Vein Isolation Procedure for Atrial Fibrillation


History of Present Illness:
66 year old male with h/o paroxysomal afib since age 20 who was
refractory to quinidine and Rythmol and has failed at least [**3-24**]
cardioversion in past. Patient came here for pulmonary vein
isolation / AF ablation. Patient stopped sotatlol and coumadin
about one week ago. During initial portion of procedure he had a
short asystolic episode at 10 AM ([**3-28**] sec). Patient was sent to
PACU at 1:30 pm after he had received Fentanyl, Versed, and
Propofol during the procedure. Patient was then hypotensive to
70/40 with brief LOC. Patient returned to baseline and found to
be fluent but not following commands and not answering questions
accurately. He could not repeat and would reiterate certain
phrases-- EP fellow called-- neuro conult-- felt exam was
consistent with cortical embolic infarct and L hemi-occiptal
lesion- wernicke's aphasia. MRI confirmed lesion, lesions were
more than 6 hours later.

mod. LV hypokinesis
mild RV free wall hypokinesis
1+ MR, [**11-19**]+ TR, LA and RA mod. dilatedThe left atrium is
moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis. Right ventricular
chamber size
is normal. There is mild global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)

regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild-moderate biventricular hypokninesis c/w diffuse
process
(toxin, metabolic, tachycardia, etc. Mild mitral regurgitation.

CT scan:
There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of
normally midline structures. There is a subtle are of loss of
the [**Doctor Last Name **]- white matter differentiation in the left temporal
lobe. . The ventricles are of normal size. Bone windows
demonstrate thickening of the ethmoid cells. The other paranasal
sinuses are normally aerated. The mastoid air cells are aerated.

IMPRESSION: Subtle area of loss of the grey-white matter
differentiation in the left temporal lobe. Recommend MRI with
diffusion weighted images.


MRA/ MRI: IMPRESSION: Several foci of restricted diffusion
involving both frontal convexities suggestive of multiple small
embolic subacute infarct. There is a larger left MCA
distribution infarct in the left parietal lobe probably
involving the parietal division of the left MCA.

Unremarkable MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 983**] without major vascular
occlusion seen. The examination was limited. Follow up is
suggested based on clinical grounds.


Brief Hospital Course:
While in house, neuro followed the patient and patient was
initially started on dopamine drip to titrate SBP to 130-140 for
24 hours. Patient was also placed on heparin drip and prednisone
taper to prevent PV stenosis. Patient neuro exam improved and he
was weaned from dopa and transferred from CCU to floor. Patient
was bridged from heparin to coumadin. Patient had some transient
nausea episodes while in house that may have been caused by a
central mechanism and were managed by placing the patient on
ondasetron. Patients bp was maintained SBP> 130. Patient's neuro
exam improved and he was able to follow commands and explain why
he was in the hospital. Although he would continue to answer
questions inappropriately at times. In addition, patient was
placed back on sotalol and QT intervals were monitered. Patient
was dc'ed on lovenox with frequent INR checks and follow up with
stroke clinic and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16471**]. Patient should be placed in an
ace inhibitor as an outpatient.
