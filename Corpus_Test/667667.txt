   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo male with CAD, hx pituitary resection admitted with fevers,
   diarrhea, shock, acidosis, progressing to acute respiratory failure
   requiring intubation/mechanical ventilation.  Now improving
 off
   pressors on minimal vent requirements.  Panhypopit/adrenal
   insufficiency appears a large component of etiologic factors given
   rapid improvement over the past day.
   #. Shock: has distributive shock picture with sepsis and adrenal
   insufficiency. No definitive infectious source identified yet, though
   CXR today has not yet performed. [**Month (only) 56**] have started with viral process,
   N/V with inability to take home meds resulting in panhypopit picture.
   Now resolved and off pressors x 2 days.
   - On hydrocortisone 100 mg IV q8h
   - IVF to maintain SBP
   - Plan for 8 days of Cefepime
   - Continue  IV vanco until sputum speciated
   #. Acute respiratory failure: remains mechanically ventilated with
   appropriate oxygenation/ventilation.
   - Extubate this am
   #. Panhypopit: On hydrocort and synthroid.
   - Endocrine consult
   #. Cardiac enzyme elevations: mildly elevated, suspect more from demand
   ischemia rather than an acute thrombotic event. Will trend enzymes to
   ensure they resolve, otherwise no add'l acute management.
   - ASA / Statin
   #. Acute renal failure: Non-oliguric, no change in renal function over
   last day. No HD needs.  Follow AG acidosis/bicarb.  Follow UOP, avoid
   nephrotoxins.
   #. ETOH abuse: Currently on versed gtt.  Will follow once off sedation.
   Tremulous today.
