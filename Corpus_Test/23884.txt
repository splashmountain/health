mitral valve repair and coronary artery bypass grafting to one
vessel. Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical
intensive care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, he
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. On postoperative
day two, he was transferred to the cardiac surgical step down
unit for further recovery. Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was gently diuresed
towards his preoperative weight. The physical therapy service
was consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and
mobility. Hi epicardial pacing wires and drains were removed per
protocol. Beta blockade was titrated for optimal heart rate and
blood pressure control. Mr. [**Known patient lastname 39888**] continued to make steady
progress and was discharged home on postoperative day four. He
will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], his cardiologist and his
