   CXR [**2527-6-2**]
   There is interval slight progression of the opacification of both lung
   bases that might be consistent with aspiration versus the
   underdevelopment of infectious process. Bilateral pleural effusions are
   most likely present, small-to-moderate. No evidence of overt pulmonary
   edema is seen. The patient is in mild interstitial engorgement. The
   right subclavian line tip is in mid SVC. No pneumothorax is present.
   Bilateral stents in the most likely
   subclavian and brachiocephalic arteries are present .
   MICRO:
   sputum from [**2527-5-31**]
 oropharengeal flora.
   Assessment and Plan
   49 y/o F w/ CAD s/p CABG, prior VF arrest p/w unrevascularized anterior
   STEMI and cardiogenic shock s/p removal of IABP and extubation [**6-1**].
   .
   #Cardiogenic Shock
 resolved, hemodynamically stable s/p extubation
   and IABP removal
   - cont captopril and carvedilol for afterload reduction (change hold
   parameters to SBP 90)
   - heparin gtt for apical AK on TTE as bridge to coumadin
   - TTE showed WMA consistent with large anterior MI, anterior septum and
   free wall hypokinetic/ akinetic, and EF depressed to 40-50%, question
   if ICD line is causing worsening TR. Will need coumadin prior to d/c
   for apical AK.
   .
   #. CAD: Severe multivessel disease, now s/p anterior wall STEMI, likely
   secondary to SSVG to LAD occlusion based on OSH cath images on
   review.   Mid LAD is occluded and there is a proximal LAD stenosis that
   supplies a moderate size diagonal, that on cath film appears to supply
   a viable, contracting territory.  Her SVG to OM has in stent
   restenosis.  Her SVG to PDA is patent.
   - Unlikely repeat PCI would provide benefit at this time
   - Will eventually need viability study prior to discharge
   - continue aspirin 325, plavix 75mg, lipitor 80, heparin gtt
   - cont captopril & coreg
   - hbA1c is 5.7
   - transfuse to HCT<30 (s/p transfusion of 2 units of PRBCs).
   .
   #. Respiratory failure:  Secondary to cardiogenic shock, extubated.
   Flashed yesterday and responded well to lasix bolus with improvement in
   clinical parameters
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - no need for lasix currently, monitor UOP to keep negative 1L
   .
   # Transaminitis: Presumably ischemic, trend enzymes and consider
   further w/u PRN
   .
   # Pneumonia
 low grade temp O/N, sputum gram stain w/ GPC
   pairs/clusters but Cx mod growth OP flora; has been on vent for
   extended period however. Unlikely MRSA pneumonia. Not hospital
   acquired. Has defervesced and improved clinically. Currently on
   Vanc/Zosyn day #2, day #4 of antibiotics.
   - discontinue vanc and zosyn for now
   - start levofloxacin 750mg x 5 days
   .
   #. Normocytic Anemia
 presumed [**3-10**] IABP placement, hapto wnl, s/p 2 U
   PRBC
   -maintain Hct > 30
   .
   #. Access: will need to d/c OSH lines today and place PICC
   #. PPx:  heparin gtt, bowel regimen prn
