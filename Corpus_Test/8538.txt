EEG:
([**12-31**]): This is an abnormal video EEG study due to periodic
generalized sharp and slow wave discharges with bifrontal
predominance
at 1-1.5 Hz frequency. These findings are suggestive of cortical
irritability and potential for epileptogenesis. However, no
electrographic seizures were seen during this recording. This
telemetry
captured one pushbutton activation but did not contain an
electrographic
seizure. Brief views of the background rhythm show a
disorganized mixed
theta/delta activity consistent with a moderate to severe
encephalopathy. No areas of focal slowing were seen in this
recording
although encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.

([**12-26**]): This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captured no pushbutton
activations. No electrographic seizures or epileptiform
discharges were
seen. The background was very slow throughout the day's
recording
suggestive of a severe encephalopathy.

([**12-25**]):  This is an abnormal video EEG study because of initial
continuous periodic epileptiform discharges at 1.5-2 Hz
consistent with
non-convulsive status epilepticus. These abated after treatment
with
intravenous phenobarbital. After 7 p.m., there were no further
definite
electrographic seizures but periodic discharges occasionally
recurred
in brief runs at frequencies less than 1 Hz. Interictal
background
activity showed severe diffuse slowing and attenuation of faster
frequencies consistent with a severe diffuse encephalopathy

([**12-22**]): This 24 hour video EEG telemetry demonstrated
generalized and
bifrontal, spike and sharp wave discharges that evolved into
periods of
sustained, rhythmic discharges, consistent with an underlying
non-convulsive status epilepticus. There were no apparent
clinical
manisfestations on video associated with the status epilepticus.

MRI Head: No acute intracranial abnormality present. Pooled
nasopharyngeal secretions and under-pneumatized mastoid air
cells bilaterally.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 29651**] is a 65 year old man, with h/o PVD, CAD, DM2, s/p
remote L BKA, and statin-induced immune-mediated necrotizing
myopathy, who presented on [**11-26**], with a right LE
ulcer/osteomyelitis to the vascular service.  He was started on
IV linezolid, cipro, flagyl, and underwent right BKA on [**12-1**].
His course has since been complicated by a. fib with RVR s/p
DCCVx1, hypotension, hypercarbic respiratory failure on [**12-5**],
prompting intubation and pressor support, as well as status
epilepticus.
.
Course on Vascular Service
.
Post-operatively, in the PACU, the patient had hypotension
96/40, with minimal oozing from wound; the patient recieved
fluids and was transfused packed red cells, eventually started
on Neo drip, with stabilization of BP, and was transferred back
to [**Hospital Ward Name 120**] 5 VICU with Neo drip.  Over the next day, the patient's
blood pressure was stable, and the Neo drip was weaned off. He
was also started Hydromorphone IV for breakthrough pain. His
Tmax was 101.0, and his R LE wound swab grew Pseduomonas. On
[**12-3**] @ 0847AM, the pt was noted to have A. FIB with RVR 160s,
SBP 95/60s->60/40, prompting re-starting the neo gtt and
transfer to CVICU with cardiology consultation.  The pt received
direct cardioversion x 1, and converted to NSR. He received IV
amiodarone load x 24hrs, then coverted to oral dosing x 1 week.
He was also started on heparin gtt, which was transitioned to
oral comadin. Cardiac enzymes were obtained, and his troponin
ranged from 0.40 to 0.53, with flat CK, MB peaked at 10. TTE was
obtained without new focal wall motion abnormality. Cardiology
did not think that the hypotension was [**1-27**] decreased EF. He was
transferred back to the vascular floor service on [**12-4**].
.
On arrival to the floor, he was described as "lethargic, easy to
arouse."  BP was 83/40, albumin hung, and BP increased. The pt
was on 2L NC with O2sat 99%, although he was noted to be
oliguric (180cc/24hr).
.
On [**12-5**], pt continued to be oliguric, with SBP in 80s, despite
albumin and fluid boluses.  He triggered for ongoing oliguria
and increasing somnolence.  He was placed on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 591**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] ABG was
drawn (7.05/81/43 @ 4AM); he was re-started on neo gtt, and then
intubated for respiratory distress (no O2 sats in chart, time
04:46AM on [**12-5**]).  His CVICU course is not documented, but he
received 2U PRBC (HCT 27->34->27).  L UE LENI was obtained to
r/o DVT.  Repeat TTE ordered (EF more depressed), heparin gtt
stopped. Cardiology was re-consulted given worsening EF. He has
been off antibiotics since [**3073-12-2**].
.
Course in MICU
# Mental Status: Throughout the MICU course patient unresponsive
thought to be secondary to anoxic brain injury. Found to be in
non convulsive Status epilepticus which eventually resolved with
AED however no improvement in mental status. MRI or LP without
etiology for mental status changes. Eventually patient made CMO
given extremely poor medical prognosis and very little hope of
meaningful improvement in mental status.
.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure - Although the details of the
decompensation are unclear, the patient had a chronic metabolic
alkalosis on admission--he has no known history of COPD or OSA,
but likely due to hypoventilation, and resultant respiratory
acidosis, caused by the necrotizing myopathy. His ABG
(7.05/81/43) during the initial event was consistent with
hypoventilation--likely contributors include myopathy (?
exacerbation from being cellcept on admission to the vascular
service), narcotic medications as well as aspiration (given
known muscle weakness). His CXR and exam were additionally
consistent with volume overload, without frank evidence of
pneumonia. PE was thought to be less likely, given the pt's
therapeutic INR and on heparin gtt. After admission to the MICU,
the pt was treated with steroids and re-started on Cellcept
(1000mg [**Hospital1 **]). Sedating medications were avoided. While
intubated, the pt did best w. pH in 7.2-7.3 range and w. pCO2
50s. Although the pt was extubated on [**12-7**], he had to be
re-intubated on [**12-10**] for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory
failure (ABG 7.14/78/56/28). Neurology consultation was
obtained, who recommended a 5 day course of IVIG, as this had
alleviated the patient's muscle weakness in the past and
facilitated extubation. Despite these efforts, he was unable to
be weaned off of the ventilator and ultimately the decision was
made for CMO and the patient was extubated.
.
# Hypotension - The patient had several episodes of hypotension
while admitted, including post-operatively, in the setting of
A.fib w. RVR, after diuresis, and while being treated with AEDs
for status epilepticus (see below). He had no evidence of frank
sepsis (lactate 0.7 and stable, leukocytosis improved initially
without antibiotics, LFTs WNL, afebrile), although his right LE
showed erythema and warmth c/w cellulitis as well as purulent
drainage from the surgical wound. A wound culture grew
Pseudomononas with sensitivities as noted above. During his MICU
stay, the patient was treated with Vanc and Cefepime (plan for 3
week course, ending on [**3074-1-2**] and [**3073-12-30**], respectively). The
pt's most prolonged period of hypotension occurred in the
setting of AED titration (with Keppra, Dilantin, and Phenobarb).
He had to be maintained on Levophed while these drugs were
initiated and titrated. He was also started on stress-dose
steroids (hydrocort 50mg Q6hr), given concern for hypoadrenalism
[**1-27**] chronic steroid use. Hydrocort was weaned and patient was
weaned from pressor support, however intermittently reguired
pressor support throughout MICU course. Pressors were removed
after patient made CMO.
.
# Status Epilepticus: After being re-intubated on [**12-10**], the
pt's mental status did not seem to recover. Prior to
(re-)intubation, his mental status had been waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 681**],
but at times the pt was alert and able to follow commands.
After intubation, he was very somnolent, unresponsive to all but
painful stimuli. During the weekend of [**1-3**], the pt was
noted to have  myoclonic jerks of his extremities. Given this,
an EEG was obtained, which showed runs of rhythmic activity
suggestive of non-convulsive seizures (see report above). Per
Neurology's recommendations, Keppra, then Dilantin and, lastly,
Phenobarbital were started. Phenobarbital was bolused with the
goal level of 25-30. Eventually status epilepticus resolved.
Patient continued to be monitored during MICU course on
continuous EEG video monitoring. Further during MICU course he
underwent an LP (WBC 1, RBC 1, 0% polys, 52% lymphs) and an MRI
brain (no epileptogenic focus), which were both essentially
unrevealing of an etiology for the pt's seizures. CSF protein
electrophoresis showed no oligoclonal banding. HSV, VZV, and [**Male First Name (un) 2292**]
negative.
.
# Acidosis: The pt's bicarb gradually trended downwards in the 7
days between [**12-12**] to [**12-20**] (28 -> 15). Gap = 10, albumin = 2.1.
Lactate WNL (1.2). This was likely a mixed acidosis??????with the
pt's chronic respiratory acidosis,  LE ischemia, septic
physiology from his wound infection, and uremia [**1-27**] ARF (see
below) all contributing.  He was cont'd on Vanc/Cefepime, stress
dose steroids, and weaned off of pressors.  Renal was consulted,
who initiated CVVH, with improvement in acidosis. Eventually
hemodialysis was attempted. However prior to permanent HD line
placement the patient was made CMO given very poor prognosis and
likely anoxic brain injury and unlikely return of meaningful
mental status.
.
# Acute renal failure: The pt had rising Cr (peak 1.6 on [**12-20**])
and decreasing urine output over [**12-16**] to [**12-20**]. Urine lytes
showed FeNa = 2, which is non-specific but c/w ATN; rare Eos and
also muddy brown casts in urine. Suspect ATN, given preceding
hypotensive episodes. Renal was consulted, and initiated the pt
on CVVH. Patient eventually underwent dialysis however given
very poor prognosis permanent HD line was not placed and patient
made CMO.
.
# PVD s/p R BKA, distant L BKA - His right LE wound cxr grew
Pseudomonas ([**12-6**]), resistant to Meropenem, sensitive to
Cefepime. Vascular surgery followed the patient and he was
continued on aspirin and plavix.
.
# Atrial fibrillation - After transfer to the MICU, his rate
controlled with amiodarone 200mg Qd s/p amiodarone loading (IV
loading, then 400mg x 7 days) and metoprolol 12.5mg TID.
.
# CAD - Continue aspirin, plavix.
.
# Systolic CHF: Held diuresis now given hypotension s/p diuresis
with lasix on [**12-11**]. Daily weights were followed. Eventually
CVVH was started and patient was bridged to HD as above.
