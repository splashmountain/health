Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81-year-old
female who was transferred from an outside hospital after
being treated for flash pulmonary edema and a subsequent
myocardial infarction.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (The patient has a past medical
history of)
1.  Protein S deficiency with recurrent deep venous
thrombosis and pulmonary emboli (she is on chronic Coumadin).
2.  She has had cardiac stenting performed.
3.  She has schizophrenia.
4.  Chronic renal insufficiency.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Her home medications included
prednisone (for her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease),
Coumadin, nitroglycerin patch, Aricept, Aldactone, Bactrim,
metoprolol, Neurontin, Lasix, Flovent, Zyprexa, and
Pravachol.

ALLERGIES:

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed the patient was afebrile.  Vital signs were stable.
The neck veins were distended.  There were bibasilar rales.
There was a [**3-29**] holosystolic murmur at the base of the heart.
The abdomen was nontender.  The extremities were without
edema.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
to the Coronary Care Unit where she was treated medically for
her myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure.  She
was also treated empirically with antibiotics (for a question
of pneumonia) and with stress-dose steroids.

While in house, early in her stay, the patient experienced
bright red blood per rectum for which she was treated with
vitamin K and underwent a colonoscopy which showed internal
hemorrhoids and diverticulosis in the sigmoid and descending
colon; otherwise a normal study.

Also while in house, the patient underwent an echocardiogram
which showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25% and
severe aortic stenosis.  A coronary artery angiogram was also
performed which showed 2-vessel coronary artery disease,
severe aortic stenosis, as well as severe systolic and
diastolic ventricular dysfunction.

After being optimized medically, the patient was taken to the
operating room on [**3298-1-21**] where an aortic
replacement and coronary artery bypass graft were performed
using a mechanical valve and the left internal mammary artery
to the left anterior descending artery.

Postoperatively, the patient did well.  She was initially
weaned from all pressors and extubated.  Her chest tubes were
removed.  She was kept on heparin early on as she did have a
protein S deficiency and there was concern that she could
have complications of emboli.  However, the patient did have
recurring problems in which she would have bronchospastic
attacks requiring reintubation.

Interventional Pulmonology was consulted and determined that
the patient suffered from tracheomalacia.  For this reason,
and due to failure of resolution of the problem, the patient
underwent stenting of her trachea.  Once performed, the
patient was restarted on Coumadin and spent the rest of her
days in the Intensive Care Unit being cared for with close
respiratory care; including nebulizer treatment such a
physical therapy and close monitoring in bringing up her
secretions.

Also while in house, the patient did test positive for
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which
was treated with vancomycin.  She also tested positive for
gram-negative rods in her urine.  Therefore, she was treated
with Levaquin for a urinary tract infection.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was in good condition on
[**3298-2-8**].

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:   The patient was to be transferred to
an acute care facility which will be able to give close
respiratory care and attention.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient will require q.6h. nebulizer as well as q.6h.
chest physical therapy.
2.  She will require her INR to be checked in order to best
monitor her Coumadin dosing.  She has a goal INR of 2 to 2.5.
3.  The patient has a baseline creatinine of approximately
1.6 to 1.7 and will also need her urine status closely
monitored.
4.  The patient may not drive for one week.  She may not lift
more than 10 pounds for three months.
5.  She may shower but not take bathes.
6.  The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4946**]
