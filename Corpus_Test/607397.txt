   Assessment and Plan
   60M with h/o COPD, tachycardia and recently diagnosed dilated
   cardiomyopathy (EF 15%) transferred with narrow-complex tachycardia and
   [**Year (4 digits) 270**].
   CORONARIES: CK peaked at 316, now trending down, likely r/t cardiac
   strain from tachyarrhythmia in setting of low EF. No acute ischemic
   changes on EKG. No episodes of CP overnight. No known history of CAD,
   plan for cath before discharge.
   - f/u ECHO
   - Trend CEs
   - Continue ASA and Statin
   - No BB or ACE for now given low BPs
   - d/c heparin IV
   - cath when hemodynamically stable, diagnostic +/- therapeutic
   - daily EKGs
   .
   PUMP: Known dilated cardiomyopathy with EF 15%, likely ischemic given
   regional WMAs. Clinically slightly volume up; lasix drip increased from
   10 to 15/hr and he has been putting out 130-180cc/hr since then; will
   likely achieve goal of -500cc by midday.
   - Plan for swan placement and determnation of need for balloon pump
   placement today
   - Gentle diuresis for preload reduction and pulmonary edema
   - Wean pressors as tolerated (currently on dopamine) but maintain BP
   support during diuresis
   - Echo today
   .
   RHYTHM: Has been mostly in sinus tachycardia since admission, with
   pressure support, but with episode of narrow-complex tachyarrhythmia at
   05:25 this morning. Broke with lopressor 5mg x1 but caused low BPs to
   SBP 63. Tele tracings of the event show abrupt transition and unclear
   if sinus vs. afib/flutter. EKGs from OSH show likely Afib vs Aflutter
   with 2:1 block that was refractory to lopressor, adenosine, verapamil
   and converted with DCCV.
   - Defib pads placed
   - Monitor on tele
   - Holding beta-blocker in setting of hypotension
   - d/c heparin gtt
   .
   Respiratory failure: Likely pulmonary edema vs COPD flare vs PNA. WBCs
   remain elevated, red blood coming out of ETT today but remains
   afebrile. Required increase in FiO2 to 60% due to desats to 91-92, not
   in setting of tachyarrhythmia.
   - f/u CXR today
   - Diuresis for pulmonary edema as above
   - Continue mechanical ventilation pending improved hemodynamic
   stability
   - ABG improved from OSH admission, 7.32/39/84. f/u AM ABG. Continue to
   trend and adjust vent settings as needed.
   - No antibiotics at this point
   - No stress dose steroids
   .
   ARF: Baseline Cre <1.0 now 3.0. Likely related to hypoperfusion in
   setting of cardiogenic [**Year (4 digits) 270**]. Urine output responsive to lasix.
   Continue to diurese and follow Cre.
   - Trend Cre
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   Metabolic acidosis: Improving. pH at OSH 7.10, now 7.32. Most likely
   resolving lactic acidosis and ARF in setting of cardiogenic [**Last Name (LF) 270**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   likely improve with improved oxygenation after diuresis.
   - Will trend ABG
   .
   Leukocytosis: likely acute demargination in setting of [**First Name3 (LF) 270**] and
   electrical cardioversion vs acute infection vs steroid-induced
   leukocytosis. Has been afebrile. Given hyperacute rise in WBC (10 at
   OSH ED yesterday), likely not infectious etiology. Given neutrophilia
   vs lymphocytosis, may not all be steroid related. CXR shows likely
   retrocardiac atalectasis but not PNA. Given isolated finding of high
   WBC, likely not sepsis.
   - Trend WBCs and monitor for fever or signs of infection
   - f/u culture data from OSH
   - Holding antibiotics
   - No steroids
   .
   Transaminitis: likely [**First Name3 (LF) 270**] liver in setting of hypoperfusion.
   - trend LFTs
   .
   Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: Unclear etiology for platelets 125, INR
   1.21. Cannot r/o DIC given multi-organ ischemia and [**First Name3 (LF) 270**].
   - INR trending down, 2.8 -> 2.6
   - low fibrinogen,  and elevated thrombin time
   - f/u repeat coags, platelets
   .
   COPD: Likely not an acute flare
   - Continue standing ipratropium, PRN albuterol but cautious with
   tachycardia
   - holding steroids
   .
   FEN: try tube feeding today, replete electrolytes as needed
   ACCESS: PIV's, A-line, RIJ. Need to change RIJ CVL.
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin IV
   -Bowel regimen with senna/colace

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 5566**], Quereshi.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   60 yr old transferred with catastrophic deterioration from dilated
   cardiomyopathy with intermittent SVT, hypotension requiring pressors,
   oliguria, increasing oxygen requirement on respirator, liver failure,
   incr INR, incr WBC, persistent pulmonary edema with modest elevation of
   troponin and no gross ischemic EKG changes.
   Physical Examination
   intubated, sedated, cool extremities with mild edema
   Medical Decision Making
   Patient with life threatening deterioration from cardiogenic [**Name (NI) 270**],
   probably nonischemic.
   Will need support with IABP or better Impella device together with
   pressors and high dose diuretics.
   Will proceed with swan, support device and coronary angiography later
   today.
   Adv CHF consult.
   Prognosis poor.
   Discussed with family.    Full code.   Time spent:  60 min.
