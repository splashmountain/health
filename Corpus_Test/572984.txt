   Assessment and Plan
   65M with presumed EtOH cirrhosis transferred from OSH for management of
   dyspnea and expedited workup for consideration of combined liver -
   kidney transplant transferred to the MICU following increased
   respiratory distress during HD
   .
   1. Respiratory distress:  Secondary to sepsis and right sided
   effusion.  Currently on mechanical ventilation.  Will attempt to wean
   as tolerated, however sedation discontinues this AM and the patient has
   not aroused.
   - Treat line sepsis as below
   - Consider tapping hydrothorax in the future, though likely to recur
   quickly
   - Echo with bubble study done yesterday did not show obvious cause of
   respiratory distress
   .
   2. Hypotension:  Likely secondary to septic shock.
   - Continue vancomycin, dosed by level, and continue zosyn
   - Removed HD line yesterday.  Left sided IJ will need to be pulled once
   infection has cleared
   - Continue daily blood cultures, follow other cultures.  Attempt to get
   more culture information from OSH
   - Fluid resuscitate CVP 8-12
   - target MAP >65
   - Will get TEE to rule out endocarditis
   .
   3. Confusion
   Likely secondary to current infection exacerbated by hypoxia, as well
   as hepatic encephalopathy.
   - Treating infection as above
   - Continue lactulose
   .
   4. Cirrhosis
   - Holding diuretics and beta blockers in setting of hypotension
   - Transplant workup per hepatology
   - f/u liver recommendations
   .
   5. Renal failure thought sequelae of ATN post surgery [**11-2**]
   - Per Renal will start CVVH through temporary HD catheter
   - Renal transplant eval if stabilized and returns to medical floor
