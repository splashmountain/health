   Initial visit, Cardiology service: CCU
   History of present illness: Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 3741**] is an 80 yo woman with HTN HL
   CAD who p/w abd pain to OSH.  She was hypotensive in the ER there.
   started on dopamine. CK 65 trop 0.19, bmp 463. new onset afib. started
   on heparin. EKG showed STE in II III aVF. given aspirin and plavix.
   ?LLL infiltrate. recd aztreonam. was xferred here for PCI.
   .
   She reports no CP/abd pain here in CCU
   .
   In the cath lab, she had a mid-RCA total occlusion with thrombus. She
   underwent thrombectomy and eventual BMS implantation. She required
   dopamine for blood pressure support through the case.

   Tests
   Cardiac Cath: 1.  Selective coronary angiography demonstrated two (2)
   vessel
   coronary artery disease.  The right coronary artery was diffusely
   diseased with a total occlusion in the mid-distal portion of the vessel
   without any flow.  The left main demonstrated no flow limiting lesions.
   The left anterior descending artery demonstrated a 30% proximal lesion
   along with a widely patent stent in the mid portion of the vessel.  The
   left circumflex demonstrated demonstrated mild luminal irregularities
   throughout.
   2.  Limited hemodynamics demonstrated low central aortic pressure
   (100/70 mm Hg) while on dopamine gtt.  The rhythm throughout the case
   was atrial fibrillation with occasional pacing from her pacemaker.
   3.  Successful PTCA, thrombectomy and stenting of the mid-distal RCA
   with a Vision (3x18mm) bare metal stent. Final angiography demonstrated
   no angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and TIMI
   II flow throughout the vessel (See PTCA comments).
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Successful PTCA, thrombectomy and stenting of the mid-distal RCA
   with a bare metal stent.
   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI.
   .
   #. Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA.
   - continue aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75
   - cont home simvastatin 80
   - hold carvedilol, lisinopril
   - check echo
   .
   # Hypotension: cardiogenic vs septic shock. wbc count elevated. no
   fever. ?h/o c diff +ve. no h/o fever or diarrhea.
   - wean off pressors
   - hold off on anti-HTNs
   - monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - cardioversion
   .
   # ?C diff diarrhea: no symptoms. wbc count at osh was 15
   - hold off on abx
   - send stool if has diarrhea
   .
   #. Afib: new onset afib
   - start IV heparin
   - BB for rate control
   .
   # CHF:
   - echo
   - hold home dose lasix, lisinopril as pt hypotensive
   .
   # HTN: hold amlodipine, BB, ACE as pt hypotensive
   .
   #. COPD: cont home combivent
   .
   #. Hyperparathyroidism: cont sensipar
   .
   #. FEN: Replete lytes prn, cardiac diet
   .
   #. Access:  PIV
   .
   #. PPx:  Sc heparin, bowel regimen prn
   .
   #. Emergency contact:
   .
   #. Code:  Presumed full
