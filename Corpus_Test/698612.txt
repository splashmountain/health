TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - HgbA1c 11.2
   - LFT's remain elevated, marginally improved from prior
   - TTE read: EF20%, extensive apical akinesis/dyskinesis, anteroseptal
   akinesis, and anterior and inferior free wall hypokinesis. Left
   ventricular apical mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Focal hypokinesis
   of the apical free wall of the RV.
   - Holding BB for now
   - Plan for ACE tomorrow
   - [**Doctor Last Name 2693**] recommending heparin gtt bridge to coumadin given lv
   hypokinesis, [**Doctor Last Name **] prefers no heparin bridge due to concern for
   bleeding, so coumadin will begin tonight at 2.5mg
   - UOP low, given 10mg lasix since pt sounded crackly and also trying to
   bring pt down on the starling curve (the left ventricle looks huge) to
   increase contractility and improve forward flow.  UOP and BP good
   afterwards.
   - had persistent [**2-28**] pleuritic chest pain in the pm, pt clearly states
   this is different from her MI pain. EKG showed diffuse ST elevation,
   consistent with pericarditis and LV aneurysm. talked to attending Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6546**], who suggested IV 30mg toradol x1, and start colchicine.  Pain
   better after given above meds.
   - glargine 10u started qhs
   - had some back pain this AM, BPs stable in 90s. not like her anginal
   equivalent. likely MSK from lying on back as improved with palpation by
   RN/MD. improved with morphine, massage, and warm compresses.

   Ca++:8.3 mg/dL, Mg++:1.7 mg/dL, PO4:2.0 mg/dL
   TTE [**2-9**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
   20 %) secondary to extensive apical akinesis/dyskinesis, anteroseptal
   akinesis, and anterior and inferior free wall hypokinesis. A left
   ventricular apical mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
   leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There
   are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
   Impression: extensive anterior, septal, apical infarction with possible
   apical clot
   CXR [**2-9**]: Normal lung volumes. Mild cardiomegaly without obvious
   overhydration. Minimal atelectasis at the left lung base. Minimal
   Kerley B lines seen in the right hemithorax, likely to reflect
   interstitial fluid overload. No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting
   pneumonia. Normal appearance of the mediastinum and the hilar
   structures.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 46 year old woman with a history of DM who presents with
   chest pain and STEMI.
   .
   1. STEMI: LAD thrombus removed and BMS placed.  ECG territory
   correlates with findings on cardiac catheterization.  Given significant
   q waves and prolonged time of chest pain, likely extensive cardiac
   ischemia.  Her risk factor is diabetes and smoking but her lipid panel
   is unremarkable. Currently BP is slightly low but no evidence of
   decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock.
   - continue aspirin, plavix, lipitor 80mg PO qday
   - held b-blocker for now given likely compensatory response to low
   cardiac output
   - pt will need PT prior to discharge
   .
   2. Post-MI pericarditis: She is at high risk for post-MI pericarditis.
   Patient has been complaining of pleuritic chest pain all day
   yesterday.  The positional nature of the pleuritic chest pain and EKG
   finding of diffuse ST elevation are consistent with post-MI
   pericarditis/dressler syndrome. Patient received toradol IV 30mg x1,
   and was started on colchicine yesterday.
   - continue colchicine
   - morphine prn
   .
   3. PUMP: EF 20% on TTE. Exam revealed crackles at bases bilaterally,
   and patient has large dyskinetic LV on echo.  CXR yesterday showed
   minimal kerley B lines seen in the right hemithorax, likely reflecting
   volume overload.  Patient also has diffuse crackles on lung exam.  BNP
   is 2464.  Patient was given 10mg lasix on [**2-9**] since pt sounded
   crackly, and also trying to bring pt down on the starling curve (the
   left ventricle looks huge) to increase contractility and improve
   forward flow.  UOP and BP good afterwards.
   - lasix prn to bring pt down on starling curve to enhance
   contractility, cardiac output and BP
   - continue coumadin 2.5mg for anticoagulation to prevent mural thrombus
   - holding beta blockade for now given acute STEMI
   - start ACEI when stable
   - will need a repeat TTE in 3 months to re-assess LV function.  If EF
   persistently <30%, then pt will need a ICD
   .
   4. RHYTHM: sinus tachycardia. This is most likely a stress responses
   with some compensation given territory of infarction.  However, she
   also has pleuritic chest pain from pericarditis.
   - holding bb but dc on metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 7**] if stable
   .
   5. DM: HgA1c 11.2.
   - hold oral agents
   - continue glargine 10u plus humalog insulin sliding scale
   - diabetic diet
   - will need to refer to [**Last Name (un) **] for diabetic control as outpt
   .
   6. Elevated LFT:  transaminitis trending down slowly, but alk phos
   trending up.  The elevated ALT, AST and LDH are possibly leakage from
   the cardiomyocytes in the setting of infarction and part of a stress
   response to STEMI, but alk phos elevation is likely from biliary stasis
   from congestive heart failure given EF only 20%.  Unclear what the
   baseline is. Unknown hepB and hepC serologies.  Patient is not
   overweight, so fatty liver is less likely.
   - consider hepB and hepC serologies as outpatient
   - continue to trend LFT
