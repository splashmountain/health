   Assessment and Plan
   #altered mental status
   -now resolved with correction of hypoglycemia.
   -head CT with improved subdural hematoma on L
   -on thiamine and MVI
   #hypoglycemia
   -given recurrent nature may be related to underlying anti-insulin
   receptor antibody
   -remains hyperglycemic, getting home lantus dose at 3U [**Hospital1 **] with insulin
   sliding scale coverage
   -change prednisone 20mg daily to IV solumedrol equivalent given
   vomiting
   -patient refusing cellcept
   -check FSBG qAC
   #hypothermia
   -unclear if this is due to altered mental status or other etiology such
   as infection
   -dicontinue vancomycin and zosyn (got 48 hour course with negative
   cultures)
   -now rewarmed
   #EKG changes likely due to hypothermia
   -will repeat EKG this morning

   Comments:
   Communication:  Comments:
   Code status: DNR / DNI, this was again reconfirmed with patient
   Disposition : call out to floor
   Total time spent:
   ------ Protected Section ------
   I have seen and examined the patient and agree substantially with the
   assessment and plan with the following modifications/emphasis:
   Overnight, remained extubated and no new problems arose though had one
   episode of emesis after eating a salad this morning
   T 37.3  P 96  BP 170/80  RR 20  Sat: 95%
   Awake, no acute distress
   Chest: CTA bilaterally
   Heart: S1 S2 reg
   Abd: Soft, NT ND
   Ext: no edema
   Assessment:
   1) Hypoglycemia
 resolved
   2) Hypothermia
 improved
   3)  Hypotension
 resolved
   4) ESRD
   5) DM
   Plan:
   1- Continue empiric antibiotics for 48 hours pending culture results
   2- [**Last Name (un) 257**] following for glucose management
   3- Vomiting episode appears isolated and abdomen is completely benign
   so will follow -> if recurs or develops abdominal pain, would consider
   abdominal CT scan
   4- Can transfer to the floor
   Time Spent: 25 minutes
