   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 885**] is a 49 yo M with achondroplasia, chronic LE lymphedema
   with recent admission for lower extremity cellulitis c/b tachycardia,
   dyspnea and hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure - unclear inciting cause for
   respiratory failure in the ED which prompted intubation. Likely has a
   component of chronic hypercarbia +/- acute hypercarbia as well given
   CO2 of 90 on admission.  DDx include pneumonia, pulmonary edema,
   intracranial event such as CVA or hemorrhage although not seen on CT
   scan.   Pneumonia more likely given infiltrate on CT scan.
   - mental status improved
   - Pt currently on PSV with MMV; pt  has high RR and low tidal volumes;
   is requiring frequent suctioning for sputum production; RSBI of 152
   this am.  Pt not likely to be extubated today.
   - CXR [**2981-6-1**]: in comparison with the study of [**5-29**] there is extensive
   opacification at the L base, consistent with pleural fluid and
   underlying atelectasis.  Supervening pneumonia cannot be excluded.
   - continue lasix (20mg IV prn) to maintain slight negative fluids and
   attempt to reduce effusion
   - continue levaquin
   -hold off on additional abx for now, consider adding cefepime for
   additional GN coverage if continues to spike fevers or has elevated WBC
   # Altered Mental Status:  resolved.  Pt communicating with letter
   board.
   -- unclear etiology; may be secondary to infection or hypercarbic
   respiratory failure
   -- continue levaquin
   #Bilateral LE cellulitis -  appears to be chronic stasis in setting of
   lymphedema.  No WBC or fever at OSH.  Wife brought in photos of pts
   cellulitis from last week.  Markedly improved on abx treatment.
   -continue vancomycin for now
   - vanco level [**2981-5-30**]: 17.1
   - change to [**Doctor First Name **]-air mattress
   #Hypertension
 stable;
   continue metoprolol; continue captropril and consider increasing dose
   this afternoon if bp remains elevated.  (home meds: metoprolol and
   terazosin)
   # FEN
   - Continue tube feeds.  Hold after midnight for attempted extubation
   tomorrow.
