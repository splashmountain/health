Other Studies:
[**3206-8-9**] Left Venous Upper Extremity: There is acute thrombus
involving the left internal jugular vein. Though patency of the
subclavian, axillary, and brachial veins is identified, there is
loss of phasicity involving the left subclavian vein which would
suggest a more central high-grade stenosis or occlusion, such as
at the brachiocephalic level.
[**3206-8-9**] CT head w/ w/o: 1. No acute intracranial process.
2. No evidence for metastatic disease. MRI is more sensitive for
small
metastases.
[**3206-8-9**] CT Chest w/: 1. Thrombosis of the left internal jugular
vein, left brachiocephalic vein (along the catheter), but no
evidence of SVC thrombosis. 2. Prominence of the ascending aorta
measuring up to 4.2 cm.
3. Incomplete evaluation of atrophic right kidney, multiple
renal cysts, and post-surgical changes involving the transverse
colon.
4. Fluid filled structure adjacent to the pancreatic head may
represent a
small bowel loop, though this region is incompletely imaged
(2:74); cannot
exclude other etiologies for this fluid collection. Recommend
clinical
correlation.
[**3206-8-10**] LLE U/S: No evidence of left lower extremity deep vein
thrombosis.
[**3206-8-10**] L foot x-ray: Three views show no evidence of acute
fracture or dislocation. There is some hypertrophic spurring
dorsally consistent with degenerative change. Substantial
inferior and posterior calcaneal spurs are seen.
[**3206-8-11**] MRI/MRA chest: Occlusion of the left internal jugular,
subclavian, and brachiocephalic vein extending to within 1 cm of
the brachiocephalic/SVC junction.
[**3206-8-14**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Baseline artifact. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**3206-7-12**] the tracing remains normal without
diagnostic interim change.
[**3206-8-15**] Unilateral subclavian venogram: Persistent clot in
subclavian, although patency improved. Discussed findings with
radiologist. Final read pending.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 75 year old male with a history of stage III
CKD, HTN, gout recently diagnosed with stage III B colon CA s/p
colectomy C1D23 of FOLFOX who presented with L neck swelling x 2
days along with L arm swelling found to have a L IJ clot.
.
# LIJ Deep venous thrombosis: Probably secondary to underlying
malignancy and catheter. The patient was treated with Heparin IV
and [**Month/Day/Year 24691**]. He was taken to IR for thrombus removal, but IR
was unable to completely remove the clot. However, they stented
his subclavian and he had improved patency. His [**Last Name (un) 14975**]-a-cath can
still be used. He was discharged on Lovenox for at least 3
months. His oncologist will determine the ultimate lenght of
anticoagulation treatment.

# HTN: Decrease lisinopril to 5 mg for now given patient's
decreased po intake, weight loss
.
# Gout: The patient complained of left knee pain. A joint tap
showed many nuetrophils and elevated white count. He was treated
with antibiotics until his cultures confirmed no bacterial
growth. By that time, his knee pain improved and there was no
need to start steroids. We continued him on his home dose of
colchicine.

# Stage III B Colon CA: C1D23 FOLFOX. The patient will have
follow up with his oncologist.
.
# Code status:
FULL code but patient is clear that he would not like a
prolonged attempt at resuscitation if it meant that he could not
have the quality of life and independence that he has now.
