   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   60 year old M with h/o of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (s/p six cycles
   of MR-CHOP) presented on [**10-28**] with fevers and new right upper lobe
   infiltrate -- > transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 42**] for worsening oxygen
   requirements and hypotension, now s/p bronchoscopy.
    #Fevers/Hypotension/Tachycardia:  On admission fit SIRS, but not shock
   criteria; End organs without dysfunction.   Blood pressures currently
   in 90
s in setting of A fib as opposed to sepsis. Source of earlier
   SIRS likely pulmonary. Urine/PICC cultures negarive. On Bactrim, so PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) 6720**]. Bronchoscopy [**3093-10-3**] with negative AFB, so  tuberculosis
   also less likely, but given concern on subsequent radiology, have
   started precautions.  Atypical pathogens and [**Month/Day/Year 1119**] diseases are
   possible given location of infiltrate and immunocompromised state.
   Currently on vancomycin and cefepime for hospital acquired pneumonia,
   Azithro started s/p bronch.
   -f/uLegionella antigen, beta-glucan, galactomannan, are all pending.
   -Toxo and crypto neg. Rapid respi Viral test negative.  Histoplasma
   negative.
-Bronchoalveolar Lavage showed:
-GRAM STAIN (Final [**3093-10-31**]):
      4+   (>10 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
      2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI.
                                    IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS.
   -f/u  induced sputum for gram stain, culture, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1119**] culture
   - f/u bronch cultures
   - currently on vancomycin and cefepime, Azithro HAP
   - will leave PICC in place for now with low threshold for removing
   - follow up blood and urine cultures, negative thus far
   - will send mycolytic cultures
   - f/u urine histoplasma, urine legionella, urine AFB, serum toxoplasma,
   serum cryptococcal Ag, serum coccidiodes antibiotics, serum
   strongyloides
   - IVF boluses for MAP < 65, urine output < 50 cc/hr
   A fib. Patient has history of A fib in past. Episodes this AM were
   asymptomatic; perhaps precipitated by fevers. Patient has earlier ECHO
   demonstrating myxoma which subsequently was reported to have cleared.
   This AM, required Lopressor times two for HR to 170
s, asymptomatic,
   with limited result. Then gave Dilt 5 mg times two with better control.
   -Starting Metoprolol 25-50BID for goal HR under 100 with presssures
   above 90 systolic.
   -Repeat ECHO
   Hypoxia:  New oxygen requirement over past 24 hours.  Pulmonary
   embolism is a concern (known cancer), but Lovneox makes less likekely.
   No evidence to suggest cardiac ischemic at this time given negative
   cardiac enzymes. No evidence of pulmonary edema/volume overload on
   exam.
   - wean oxygen as tolerated
   -Con
t Lovenox
   - if worsening pulmonary status would consider repeat CT scan to assess
   for PE as well as worsening interstitial disease
   Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma: Admitted in his [**4-28**] cycle of MR-CHOP now
   on day 15. Completed HD-MTX one week prior to admission and his counts
   have recovered although he remains thrombocytopenic and anemic.
   - hematocrit goal > 25 (received one unit today)
   - no indication for platelet transfusion at this time
   - not neutropenic
   - continue bactrim for prophylaxis
   DVT: Diagnosed in [**Month (only) 1002**].  On lovenox on admission.  They are not
   painful.
   - con
t  lovenox
   - stop Heparin gtt today now s/p bronch
   FEN: Neutropenic low acid diet, NPO after midnight for possible
   bronchoscopy, monitor electrolytes, IVF for urine output < 50 cc/hr,
   MAP < 65
   Access: left sided pICC
   Prophylaxis: Lovenox, bowel regimen, home PPI
