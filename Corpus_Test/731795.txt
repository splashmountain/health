   transferred for severe respiratory failure on ventilator at OSH after
   aspiration episode during elective EGD procedure.
   24 Hour Events:
   - Overnight chest tube placed on left by thoracic surgery, placed to
   -20cm suction
   - pCO2s slowly improving on AC FiO2%:60; Rate:12: TV:550; PEEP:5; with
   goal rate 12, checking Q1hr ABGs
   - Received 2-3L NS overnight, lactates peaked at 3.4 and came down to
   2.6
   - 4:30am, patient with increased belly rigidity, decreased bowel
   sounds, KUB without any overt free air, CXR relatively unchanged,
   ordered for CT torso w/o contrast with wet read of
   1. Extensive multifocal focal air-space consolidation, L > R.
   Compatible with known aspiration. L chest tube terminates in the L
   apex. Small PTX along medial aspect of the L pleural space.
   2. Trace perihepatic fluid. GB sludge. Mild non-specific fat stranding.
   No large ascites. No pneumoperitoneum. NGT in stomach. Foley in

   Assessment and Plan
   59M with h/o anemia, recent H.pylori gastritis transferred for severe
   respiratory failure on ventilator at OSH after aspiration episode
   during elective EGD procedure, and now s/p chest tube placement for
   pneumothorax and suspected sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient arrived with severe respiratory acidosis
   with difficulty ventilating at OSH with evidence of aspiration there
   following and EGD. Admit CXR showing bilateral patchy infiltrates and
   breathing most likely [**12-30**] aspiration pneumonitis with severe
   bronchospasm. Overnight trialed various ventilation strategies to
   improve ventilation, including decreasing PEEP, then decreasing rate to
   allow for increased air exchange with his evidence of severe
   bronchospasm.  Also CXR showed PTX on left which explains much of his
   difficulty ventilating, high airway pressures, hypotension, and
   tachycardia on admission (now s/p chest tube placement overnight) .
   Could still have obstruction of particles in airway, but ETT was too
   small to bronch through overnight and would be high risk to change tube
   given airway edema seen at OSH.  Patient appears more stable this
   morning s/p left sided chest tube placement for left sided PTX and
   heavily sedated but not paralyzed.  Patient likely had severe
   barotraumas in setting of very high pressures at OSH.
   .
   - uptitrate versed and fentanyl to control his repiratory drive now ,
   may need to add propofol this a.m.
   - monitor left chest tube drainage (about 80cc out serosanguinous
   fluid) , send fluid for amylase level given local trauma/tear concerns
   still
   -continue low intermittent suction at 20 now with chest tube
   - continue to cover broadly with vanc/zosyn given patient's critical
   status & aspiration events / bilat opacities on imaging
   - f/up thoracics recs
   -start bicarb drip
   -adjust ventilator settings to improve ventilation (continue  moderate
   TV today & longer expiratory length)
   -check ABGs Q1-2 hours today
   - continue treating bronchospasm with inhaled nebulizers and low RR
   strategy / prolonged expiratory time
   - no good evidence for steroids in setting of aspiration
   PNA/pneumonitis so not continuing
   -add systemic high dose steroids to combat any bronchospasm issues /
   methylpred 80 q8hrs
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient with leukopenia with 35 bands, hypotension requiring
   pressors, tachycardia, elevated lactate. CVP 15-18. Currently on
   levophed.
   - continue pressors, fluid boluses prn to maintain CVP>10, MAP>65,
   UOP>30cc/hr
   - send BCx, sputum Cx, UCx
   - broad spectrum antibiotics as above with Vanc/Zosyn
   - trend lactates, CVO2 sat today q8 hours
   - need to change CVL A-line, will hold off on change of R IJ right now
   given tenous status / attempt tomorrow
   .
   # H. pylori gastritis s/p repeat EGD: Per records, EGD at OSH on day of
   admission for repeat biopsies for H. pylori which was diagnosed in
   [**12/2904**] during admission for UGIB and treated with Prevpak and PPI. No
   good records on findings during EGD today, however, no note of active
   bleeding
   -continue to trend CBC/HCTs , no evidence of any active GIB at this
   time
   - continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - maintain active T/S
   - f/u H. pylori biopsies from OSH
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Up from prior baseline of normal renal function,
   likely component of prerenal and also possible ATN in context of low
   pressures. [**1-30**] granular casts on urine.  Given very prominent acidosis
   he may need dialysis so will favor renal team involvement at this
   juncture.
   .
   - renal consult
   -starting bicarb IV today
   - renally dose medications
   - send urine lytes
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at recent baseline
   - maintain active T/S
   - trend Hct [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Thrombocytopenia :  Likely due to overwhelming sepsis, HIT considered
   as well but will continue to monitor and not sending off PF4 studies
   just yet.
   - adding DIC labs
   -Holding heparin for now / pneumoboots only for PPx
   -continue to trend [**Hospital1 7**]  CBC labs.
   -f/up smear
   - f/up fibrinogen
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH at OSH was 4.66
   - continue home levothyroxine dose when OG off suction
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Not on medications at home, no known history of CAD
   .
   # Anxiety:
   - continue home citalopram when OG off suction
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, OG tube in place
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, if no active bleeding and Hct stable, can
   start SC heparin
   # Access: OSH RIJ in place, L a-line in place (will change this a.m.)
   # Restraints: 2 limbs as intubated
