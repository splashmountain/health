   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   1. Pump: Patient has advanced systolic CHF with EF of 15-20%.
   Exacerbation likely [**2-14**] medication non compliance given that he can't
   afford his medications or take care of himself.  Patient currently
   appears volume overloaded, with JVP elevated to the mandible.  He
   continues to have orthopnea, ascites, and LE edema. Plan for R heart
   cath tomorrow, as INR currently 4.0. Would consider starting milrinone
   after cath in addition to Lasix drip.   Negative 1.7L overnight since
   initiation of diuresis.
   -Will wedge today to assess volume status
   -Continue Lasix gtt 3.5mg/hr to goal wedge 22, goal -2-3L/day
   -Continue Milrinone
   -Continue Metolazone 5mg po bid
   -holding lisinopril in the setting of acute renal failure
   -check [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has no known CAD. Cardiomyopathy is chronic, and
   patient is non compliant with medications. However have not ruled out
   ischemic etiology of CHF.
   -NPO for possible cath today
   -ASA, statin
   -holding BB in the setting of hypotension and acute CHF exacerbation
   .
   .
   # RHYTHM:  patient has history of VT, atrial tachycardia, afib s/p
   ablation and ICD implant. Currently V paced.
   -monitor on telemetry
   -Hold Coumadin today
   -hold digoxin given ARF. Will check dig level prior to continuing at
   current dose.
   .
   #  Anticoagulation: INR 4.0, on coumadin for afib. Unable to perform
   procedures such as catheterization, central line insertion, abdominal
   paracentesis given current INR. Hesitant to give FFP given additional
   volume would likely worsen heart failure.
   -hold coumadin
   -Vitamin K
   -f/u INR in AM
   .
   #  Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline Cr 2.1?. Cr improving with
   diuresis. Improved from 4.1 at OSH. Likely [**2-14**] poor forward flow.
   -mucomyst prior to c. cath tomorrow
   -trend Cr. If worsening, would send urine lytes.
   -renally dose meds (digoxin)
   -hold lisinopril
   .
   #  Normocytic Anemia: HCT 30.8. MCV of 97. Stable from prior admission.
   -check B12 and folate
   -guaiac stools
   -f/u Thyroid function as outpatient
   .
   #  Chronic hepatitis C: Patient has ascites, elevated LFTs, all stable
   or improved from prior hospitalization. [**Month (only) 47**] be [**2-14**] congestive
   hepatopathy. No abdominal pain, leukocytosis, or fevers that would be
   concerning for SBP.
   -consider therapeutic paracentesis once INR < 1.7
   -trend LFTs. If worsening, would consider further work up.
   .
   .
   FEN:  Heart healthy diet. Replete lytes PRN
   .
   ACCESS: PIV
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx -INR 4.0
   -Pain management with tylenol PRN
   -Bowel regimen with  senna, colace
