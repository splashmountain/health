   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 COUGH
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE)
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   1.       Hypotension: etiology likely dehydration with some SIRS in
   setting of UTI and possible PNA
   2.       ARF: DDx is dehydration is concern with FeNa of 0.5%, but
   checked urine eos neg, and will check renal US in case she has a post
   obstr process with UTI/stone looking for hydro.
   3.       UTI: Double cover for GNR with quinolone and 3rd gen
   cephalosporin in case of resistance
   4.       Pleural effusion: etiology unclear  - may be large transudate
   due to heart failure but parapneumonic and malignancy are also of
   concern. Will plan for thoracentecis but need to speak with daughter
   Update on overall gaols of care
 we have learned that while at [**Hospital **]
   Rehab with aggressive diuresis her Cr bumped to 4 and when the issue of
   HD was brought up family seemed to decline and indeed initiaed
   cobnversation on possible Palliative Care. Need to meet with daughter
   at 6Pm to clarify goals before further procedures are done.
