Brief Hospital Course:
Vanco and Zosyn were started on [**3-2**] and Urology was consulted.
It was felt that he had bulbar urethral injury with
extravasation and abscess. On [**3-3**] CT with contrast showed
multiple loculated fluid collections within the perineal region
adjacent to the urethra. There was concern for urethral fistula
from the pancreatic graft.  Peri-anal fistula was thought to be
less likely given the location of the loculated collections. On
[**3-3**] a retro urogram revealed no evidence of bladder or urethral
leak. Irregularity along the membranous urethra extending to the
prostatic urethra was suggestive of chronic inflammatory or
edematous state.

On [**3-4**] he had incision and drainage of perineal abscess and
exam under anesthesia for pernieal abscess. A swab revealed  2+
PMNs and no growth.  Wound dressings consisted of packed with
Iodiform and external gauze. A foley catheter remained in place.
On [**3-5**] CT without contrast showed significant improvement.
Stable peripenile multiloculated fluid collections stable
surrounding inflammatory change. New air within the renal pelvis
of the left pelvic transplanted kidney.
On [**3-5**] he underwent re-exploration of perineum for perineal
abscess on [**3217-3-5**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
On [**3-6**], he had successful CT fluoroscopic-guidance drainage of
multiloculated fluid perineal collection. This aspirate has been
negative to date including AFB. Fluid was sent for amylase and
lipase of which both were high.

Nephrology followed him during this hospital stay.
The plan was to send him to [**Hospital 99**] Rehab for iv vanco and po
augmentin [**Hospital1 **] for 2 weeks with left buttock dressing changes qd.
The wound tract was ~8cm and was loosely packed with saline wet
to dry kerlex ~5cm. A foley was left in place. UA was repeated
on [**3-9**] for wbc of 13.1. UA demonstrated [**4-30**] wbc, lg RBC, mod
leukocytes, 1 eosinophil and negative nitrites. A urine culture
was also sent.

The long term plan is to convert the pancreas transplant from
bladder drainage to enteric drainage once the infection resolved
and the wound healed. Foley needs to remain in place until
surgery.
