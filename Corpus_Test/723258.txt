   Assessment and Plan
   47 yo woman with a history of chronic Hep C cirrhosis complicatied by
   portal HTN and refractory ascites, DM, s/p failed TIPS procedure,
   presented with abdominal ascites, bilateral leg edema, and found to
   have an elevated creatinine and transferred to MICU to due worsening
   respiratory status.
   .
   # Hypoxia - Patient with hypoxia overnight and new oxygen requirement.
   Initially required 15L rebreather and 4L NC maintaining 02 sats at
   92-93%. Given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 prior to transfer.
   Acute hypoxic event earlier on day of transfer to CCU likely due to
   decreasing respiratory drive from methadone in setting of increased
   pulmonary edema.  Repeat chest films yesterday suggestive of ARDS,
   corroborated by normal TTE.  Etiology of ARDS includes HAP vs.
   hepatopulmonary syndrome vs. SBP (less likely).  Pt maintained on BiPAP
   throughout day and overnight, tolerated well, desats to 70s without
   positive pressure.
   - Continue BiPap as needed to maintain 02 Sats>92%, consider trial of
   non-rebreather if chest film improved this AM
   - check daily weight
   - elevate head of bed >30 degrees.
   - follow clinically with serial chest exams
   - albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6h prn SOB or wheezing
   - sparing use of diuretics due to HRS -> lasix 40 IV given this am
   since Cr stable
   - Will fluid restrict to 750 cc
   - Will recheck ABG this afternoon and consider intubation if
   respiratory status not improved
   - continue vanc/cefepime for possible aspiration pneumonia
   - check HIV serology
   .
   # ARF: Pt w/ Cr of 2.7 on admission from baseline of 1.2 in early [**Month (only) 91**],
   now 2.0, from 1.9 yesterday. Currently undergoing treatment for HRS. No
   hypertension. Last paracentesis [**9-8**] ~3L. Urine Na 21 on [**9-5**], urine
   culture with contaminants. Potassium at time of transfer is 5.2.
   - cont to monitor serum lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Kayexalate PRN
   - low potassium diet
   - Continue [**Month (only) **]/mid/alb, goal creatinine 1.5
   - monitor blood pressure
   - daily creatinine
   .
   # HCV cirrhosis and ascites: Pt w/ chronic HCV and cirrhosis (Grade 1
   varices and congestive gastropathy) that is usually managed by weekly
   parascentesis, s/p failed TIPS ([**7-15**]). SBP (-) on [**9-8**]. Also has elevated
   AFP=10.2. Para cx NG from [**9-8**]. Patent main portal vein and hepatic
   vasculature. MELD 20.
   - continue [**Month (only) **]/mild/albumin - patient appears to be benefitting
   - continue lactulose
   - TIPS to be done as outpatient.
   - f/u on calorie count.
   - f/u liver recs
   .
   # Diabetes. Patient reports that her diabetes is well controlled on
   insulin at home.
   - Continue Insulin.

   CRITICAL CARE ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She remains on BiPAP today with stable sats and no worsening tachypnea.
   Creat down to 1.8 but CXR has not improved. I am worried about atypical
   infection including PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will induce sputum for PCP today and
   [**Name9 (PRE) 7929**] treat with steroids/ bactrim (dosed for creatinine
   clearance). An HIV test will be obtained . if she should need
   intubation, we will proceed with bronchoscopy and BAL. ? possibility of
   eosioniphilic pneumonia despite lack of peripheral eos raised. Urine
   will be screened for esopiniphils.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill
