HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 57 year old
white male with a past medical history significant for HIV
diagnosed in [**2951**] with a CD-4 count of 340 with a viral load
of 364,000, in intermittent HAART therapy with non-compliance
in the past two months, childhood epilepsy, qestionable
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and dysphagia secondary
to hypertrophied cricopharyngeal muscle, who was transferred
to [**Hospital1 509**] from [**Hospital6 5628**] with anemia, acute renal failure, hypoxic
respiratory failure and respiratory distress resulting in
emergent intubation.

The patient initially presented with Infectious Disease
Clinic with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 23734**] on [**11-11**] and the patient was found to
have a low hematocrit to 21.8 to a norm of 44.  Decrased
platelets were to 88 from a norm of 158.  The patient was
called the next day and directed to go the nearest Emergency
Department for further work-up.

On admission, the patient's hematocrit was noted to be 18
with a creatinine of 4.2.

On review of systems, the patient is reporting increased
fatigue, weakness and muscle aches times three months,
positive headaches status post recent fall with mild head
trauma, no loss of consciousness.  At [**Hospital6 1919**],
the patient was transfused to a hematocrit of 27.  GTP was
ruled out with negative shistocytes on smear.  The patient
was found to be hypoxic on hospital day number two and an
arterial blood gases of 7.48, 28 and 55 on room air, and was
intubated.  The patient was found to have bilateral
infiltrates on chest x-ray likely secondary to infection
versus congestive heart failure.

The patient has a left femoral Quinton catheter placed on
[**11-16**] and hemodialysis was initiated with significant
improvement in ventilation and oxygenation.  Subsequently,
the patient's hematocrit dropped again from 27 to 17.
Abdominal and pelvic CT scan was done on [**11-18**] revealing a
large retroperitoneal hematoma 9 by 7 centimeters.  The
patient remained hemodynamically stable and was transfused to
a hematocrit of 24 on transfer.

At [**Hospital1 509**], the patient was
started on treatment for empiric PCP and community acquired
pneumonia with Bactrim.  The only positive cultures included
Methicillin sensitivie Staphylococcus aureus in
nasopharyungeal swabs and positive [**Female First Name (un) **] in sputum.  On
[**11-13**] yeast.  On [**11-14**] blood cultures for Legionella, PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) 20518**], CMV, Hepatitis B and parvo virus were all negative.
Prednisone was started secondary to the patient's low PAO2.
Cardiac, the patient had a CK of 147, MB 14.5, troponin 0.5,
no acute ischemia was appreciated on the EKG.

The patient had an echocardiogram on [**11-12**] with an ejection
fraction of 45 to 50% with inferior mild hypokinesis.  No
pulmonary hypertension, with normal left ventricular size.
One plus mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation.
The patient was then transferred to vent setting.  The
patient with no spontaneous respirations on [**11-8**], PEEP of
22.  The patient was total volume of 600 by 12, 60%.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On examination, the patient had a
temperature of 98.0 F.; blood pressure 156/80; pulse 64;
respirations 12; saturation of 100% on aforementioned
ventilator settings.  Generally, the patient was pale,
cachectic, chronically ill appearing and looking older than
stated age, grimcing to noxious stimuli.  HEENT:  Pupils are
equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles are
intact.  Anciterc sclerae.  Oropharynx with mild thrush.  No
epistaxis.  Neck:  The patient had a right IJ.  Lungs:  The
patient had high pitched bronchial breath sounds in the right
lower lobe.  Otherwise clear bilaterally with no crackls and
no wheezing.  Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm with
a II/VI systolic ejection murmur best appreciated in the left
upper sternal border.  Abdominal examination:  The patient
was mildly distended, soft, no masses, with some flank
fullness, right greater than left with a persistent area of
ecchymosis.  Extremities with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
No rashes or bruises.  Warm and good pulses throughout.
Neurological:  Toes were downgoing bilaterally, one plus deep
tendon reflexes throughout.  Rectal:  The patient was guiac
negative.

LABORATORY:  On admission, white blood cell count of 4.6,
hematocrit of 25.7, platelets of less than 40.  Coagulation
studies were PT 12.9, PTT 25, INR 1.1.  Chem 7 was sodium of
143, potassium of 4.2, chloride 107, bicarbonate 24, BUN of
40, creatinine of 4.8, glucose of 92, calcium of 8.7,
magnesium 2.1, phosphorus 5.2.  D-dimer greater than [**2958**].
Fibrinogen 338.  CK and troponin were negative.

Urinalysis with large blood, 100 protein, 100 glucose.

ASSESSMENT:   The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital1 509**]
with issues of:  1) Anemia; 2) hypoxia; 3) acute renal
failure.
1.  Anemia:  The patient was transfused a total of 11 units
of packed red blood cells at [**Hospital6 1919**].  He was
found to have a retroperitoneal bleed on [**11-16**] secondary to
dialysis catheter placement dropping the patient's
hematocrit.
2.  Acute renal failure:  Hemodialysis was initiated.  The
patient had a creatinine of 4.2.
3.  Infectious Disease:  The patient was treated for
community acquired pneumonia.  The patient was started on
Bactgrim, Zithromax, Ceftriaxone.
4.  Pulmonary:  The patient was intubated secondary to
hypoxia and respiratory distress.

On admission, the patient's admission hematocrit was 25.2.
The patient was transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells
and appropriately bumped to a hematocrit of 34.9.  The
patient's acute renal failure was thought to be new.  A renal
consultation was obtained.  The patient arrived intubated.
The patient had a bronchoscopy on [**2961-11-21**] showing copious
thick secretions and on [**11-22**], showing a decrease in
patient's secetions.  The patient had a head CT scan on [**11-20**]
which was negative for bleed.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  PULMONARY:  On patient's head CT scan the patient was
found to have sinusitis and the patient was found to have
infiltrate on chest x-ray and unclear whether secondary to
congestive heart failure versus infection.  In light of this
and the patient's sinusitis, the patient was started on a 14
day course of Zosyn. The patient remained clnically
successfully intubated in Intensive Care Unit.  The patient's
respiratory status continued to immprove and the patient
remained clinically stable until the morning of [**2961-12-7**],
when he was found to be in respiratory distress and
tachypenic.

The chest x-ray showed a right sided opacity in the patient's
right lung.   The patient was asymptomatic at this time and
afebrile.  The patient was felt to be in frank pulmonary
edema secondary to patient's hypertension.  The patient was
placed on a Labetolol drip and Hydralazine.  The patient's
subsequently improved after hemodialysis and the patient's
respiratory status remained stable throughout hospital course
to the time of discharge.

2.  DYSPHAGIA:  The patient has cricopharuyngeal dysplasia,
disphagia and hyperplasia for which the patient has received
a PEG to receive gastric feeidng.  The patient was evaluated
by Speech and Swallow who agreed with diagnosis of
cricopharyngeal dysphagia.  The patient was cleared for a
puree diet with small daily snacks of pureed food and liquids
under supervised conditoins only and strict aspiration
precautions.

The patient only cleared for p.o. foods following strict
swallow recommendations from Speech and Swallow including as
follows:  The patient to take a bite of pureed food, hold in
mouth and tilt chin towards chest wall, swallow hard three
times and then take sip of thin liquids, hold in mouth, tuck
in to chest, swallow hard two to three times, cough and
swallow again.  Myometry surgery is recommended for this
patient by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] from ENT Surgery in one to two
months, when patient's nutritional status improves.

3.  NEUROLOGICALLY:  The patient was continued on Dilantin
for childhood epilepsy.  Given the patient's new
hemodialysis, the patient should have three Dilantin levels
checked q. five days.  The patient will be continued on
Dilantin dose of 300 three times a day followed by three
Dilantin levels.  During hospital stay, the patient also had
change in mental status.  For patient's change in mental
status the patient was started on low dose Risperdol 0.5 mg
q. h.s. This dose may be discontinued in the future if the
patient clinically remains stable.  This dose should not be
increased as it will lower the patient's seizure threshold.
During the [**Hospital **] hospital course the patient was found to
be somewhat sundown and somewhat deliriuos and most liely
etioloyg of this was patient's hypertension.  Once the
patient's blood pressure was under better control and the
patient was on low dose Risperdol, mental status was much
clearer.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient's HIV status was that
patient's HAART therapy will be started as an outpatient.
The patient is to follow-up with Infectious Disease Clinic.

5.   HYPERTENSION:  The patient suffered from malignant
hypertension which was extremely challegnging to deal with
throughout the [**Hospital **] hospital course.  The patient was
tried on multiple medications which included hydralazine,
Labetolol and Norvasc.  Finally, the patient's hypertension
was under much improved control on a regimen of 50 mg of
Hydralazine p.o. three times a day, Labetolol 600 mg p.o.
twice a day and Minoxidil 2.5 mg p.o. q. day and Clonoidine
patch transdermal q. week.

6.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient was started on
hemodialysis on Monday, Wednesday and Friday which he
tolerated well.  A renal biopsy was delayed initailly because
the patient had extermely difficult to control hypertension.
A renal biopsy was done prior to discharge and was
non-diagnostic.  Further immuno histo will be sent and change
is most consistent with hypertensive nephropathy.  The
patient will continued with4 lifetiem hemodialysis three
times a week.

7.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has an HIV history
diagnosed in [**2951**].  CD4 count of 300, viral load greater than
350,000.  No anti-retrovirals in the last two months.
History of hepatitis A and B, childhood epilepsy, status post
hernia repair, depression, remote history of substance abuse,
questionable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
hypertrophy of cricopharyngeal muscle dysphagia.

The patient's medications at home were Dilantin 200 mg twice
a day.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Prednisone 20 q. day.
2.  Dilantin 200 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Amphagel 30 q. day.
4.  Morphine 2 mg q. two hours p.r.n.
5.  Zithromycin 500 mg q. day.
6.  Bactrim.
7.  Ativan.
8.  Ceftriaxone 1 gram q. day.
9.  Protonix 40 mg q. day.
