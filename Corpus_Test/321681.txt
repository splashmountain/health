Chief Complaint:
   HPI:
   70 yr old man with severe COPD on (steroids high dose) and course of
   azithromycin, HTN, CHF (cardiomyopathy s/p chemo) lung cancer s/p
   resection, AAA in [**10-10**] presented with chief compliant of hematemesis.
   The morning of admission at NH, s/p fall reaching from nightstand with
   head trauma -- shortly thereafter reports of vomiting blood.  Initial
   evaluation significant for lactate 2.8, abnormal gallbladder on US
   thickened wall with edema.  Overnight became cold, clammy, hypotensive
   with tachypnea and chest pain.  Initially negative cardiac enzymes.
   Received femoral A-line, venous access, started dopamine peripheral
   changed to levophed with subsequent tachycardia.  Switched to dopamine
   and dobutamine.  He received 3L fluid.  Cards TTE preliminary global
   hypokinesis.  Gas 7.12/42, lactate 7.7.  CT abdomen with PO contrast
   edematous gallbladder no other significant findings.  TEE unremarkable
   for dissection, empirically started on heparin for concern of primary
   cardiac etiology vs PE. Morning of [**10-1**] developed bright red blood per
   ETT tube.  [**2693-9-29**], able to wean dopamine and dobutamine; however
   during the day of [**10-2**] he required further dopamine.  RUQ U/S negative
   for portal vein thrombosis, gall bladder mildly edematous. LENIs
   negative for DVTs. Given 500cc bolus without any change in UOP.
   Received platelets [**10-1**] for platelet count 51 in setting of
   hemoptysis.  Renal consulted yesterday with plans for HD today or
   tomorrow (unclear if plan to do [**Name (NI) **] or HD.)

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yr old man with severe COPD on (steroids high dose), HTN, CHF, lung
   cancer s/p resection, AAA with extensive AA graft who developed acute
   cardiogenic shock and hemoptysis; etiology unclear but most likely
   etiology is cardiogenic shock most likely [**3-6**] MI.
   1)       Shock: Unclear initial etiology
 PE vs primary cardiac
   process. No e/o DVT in LEs. Could not pursue CTA given renal failure
   and V/Q scan would be difficult to perform and interpret in the setting
   of critical illness and severe COPD. He is not on anticoagulation [**3-6**]
   significant hemoptysis. Hold on aspirin. Now on beta-blocker. Continue
   statin. Suspect that his persistent current hypotension may be
   exacerbated by his significant volume overload and increased afterload
 he may markedly improve with HD and some volume removal. Would change
   Hydrocort to Prednisone today with plans for a long (2 week at least)
   taper.
   2)       Respiratory: Intubated initially for airway protection in the
   setting of altered mental status. CO2 remains low in setting of
   mechanical ventilation. Continues to tolerate pressure support [**1-10**]
   with very good tidal volumes. Continue daily SAT and SBTs as tolerated.
   Continue to treat the GNRs in his sputum with continued Zosyn.
   3)       ID: Only positive micro data is GNRs in sputum. D/c
ed Vanc
   and Flagyl but would continue Zosyn. Follow cultures and clinical
   status.
   4)       Renal: Appreciate Renal assistance. Urine sediment c/w ATN
   (muddy brown casts.) Remains oliguric; now ~11 liters up during this
   hospitalization. Plan for dialysis catheter today and HD versus [**Month/Day (4) **]
   today or tomorrow.
   5)       Cardiac: Not cycling enzymes now that infarct appears to have
   completed. Low dose beta-blocker as above. Continue statin. Off
   dobutamine.
   6)       Heme: Positive DIC panel
 unclear why this is positive. INR
   remains elevated at 1.9
 will need FFP prior to placing HD catheter.
   Thrombocytopenia persists. No e/o active bleeding (persistent but
   improved mild bloody secretions in the ETT suction.) Follow H/H,
   transfusion goal > 30% in setting of CAD / possible cardiogenic shock.
   7)       F/E/N: TFs. Follow / replete
lytes in setting of renal
   failure.
   8)       Liver: Transaminases improving. Likely improving shock liver.
   Monitor LFTs, bili, INR.
   9)       Endo: RSSI, follow sugars. Change Hydrocortisone to Prednisone
   today as above.
   10)   Code: full; Access: D/c art line today; Dispo: MICU.

   Critical Care Staff Addendum
   7:30p
   I saw and examined the patient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the ICU fellow, whose
   note reflects my input.  I would add/emphasize:
   Very ill 70 y/o man with complicated PMH as detailed above and in chart
   now with respiratory failure, shock, and acute renal failure.  The
   shock is of somewhat uncertain etiology and clinically appears to be
   mixed.  He has responded well to treatment and is now down to low-dose
   dopamine.  He has evidence of global hypoperfusion, with shock liver
   and ATN.  Reasonable to begin to taper steroids at this point; would
   use methylprednisolone given his liver injury.  Given COPD, will also
   check autoPEEP.  The respiratory failure is related to the shock and
   also to likely pneumonia, as well as his underlying COPD, though
   ventilation and oxygenation have major challenges in the past day.
   Finally, he has dense oliguric renal failure.  While he may improve, he
   is not likely to do so in the next few days and I agree with renal that
   dialysis is reasonable in this setting.  Other issues as per Dr.
