Chief Complaint:  Lightheadedness
   Reason for MICU admission: Hypotension
   HPI:
   This is an 84 yo M with a past medical history significant for multiple
   myeloma (gets care at DF), on dexamethasone, who presents to the ED
   today with complaints of weakness and fatigue for several days. He does
   not endorse any localizing symptoms, but notes that he is "not feeling
   well" and feels weak. He describes that he had a near syncopal event
   yesterday. He describes that he was about to leave his home and
   suddenly fell. He did not have his walker with him. He endorses a
   prodrome of lightheadedness and felt "woozy" but denies loss of
   consciousness.  He did scrape his right knee and side of the face a
   little bit. He saw his gerontologist the same day, but felt better by
   that time. He describes possible fever/chills at home, but did not
   measure his temperature. He denies any n/v/d, sick contacts, myalgias,
   chest pain, palpitations or headache. He is complaining about severe
   sweating that occurs at night without any reason for which he had a
   work up at the VA that was unrevealing.
   Upon arrival to the ED, initial vital signs were 98.2 80 80/43 20 98%
   on room air. Tmx was 99.7. Exam was nonlocalizing with a benign
   abdominal exam. His lactate was 1.3, but labs were otherwise
   significant for a leukocytosis to 26,000 with a left shift, acute renal
   failure with a creatine of 2.3. He had a normal cxr, neg UA.
   Blood/urine cx were drawn and he was given 3L of NS with little
   improvement in his blood pressure. ECG was without acute change, and a
   troponin was elevated at 0.44, prompting a cardiology consult who
   advised that this was likely in the setting of ARF and hypotension and
   was not ACS. He was given an aspirin. At this time, the concern for
   relative adrenal insufficiency was raised and he was given a dose of
   stress dose hydrocortisone, with subsequent improvement in his BP to
   88/39. He was mentating clearly throughout.
   He is being admitted to the MICU for hypotension. At time of transfer
   to the MICU, his vitals were 73 88/39 20 96%ra, but he subsequently
   dropped his pressures to the 60
s. A CVL was placed, he was started on
   levophed and given a dose of vanco, CTX and flagyl. He now has a CVL
   and 2 18g PIV's for access, and has been started on his 4th L NS.
   Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient is alert and talkative. He feels
better
. He notes that he always has some amount of shortness of
   breath, and although he appears somewhat breathless, he will not
   endorse that this is any worse from his baseline. He denies pleuritic
   chest pain, palpitiations.

   Imaging:

   Prior TTE [**2776**] - Conclusions
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. There may be a small interatrial shunt by color Doppler
   examination. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
   left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is markedly
   dilated The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
   aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric. The
   left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   No intracardiac mass identified (cannot definitively exclude).

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo M with history of MM, DVT, admitted with hypotension and ARF.
   #. Hypotension - Patient is afebrile, with a leukocytosis and no
   localizing symptoms. Hypotension was refractory to 3L of NS. Elevated
   WBC could be from dexamethasone, but there is a left shift and a mild
   bandemia. Suspicion is for occult infection compounded by poor PO
   intake and relative adrenal insufficiency in the setting of chronic
   steroid use. Other possibilties include PE, but no shortness of breath
   or tachycardia; cardiogenic shock is unlikely, as troponin elevation is
   less likely ACS and more likely the result of ARF and hypotension. As
   for source of possible sepsis, patient does not have any localizing
   symptoms. He is s/p CCY, UA is unremarkable, CXR is clear, abdominal
   exam is benign, no rashes. Given that he is relatively
   immunocompromised, it could be bacterial, atypicals or perhaps viral or
   fungal infection leading to poor PO intake and dehydration and actually
   not sepsis at this point. ?influenza, but no characteristic symptoms.
   - continue stress dose steroids for now
   - continue IVF aggressively overnight with caution for his history of
   valvular dysfunction
   - maintain CVP>10-12 mmHg, MAP>65
   - measure CvO2 sat
   - continue broad spectrum abx with vanco, zosyn, azithro
   - hold home anti-hypertensives until hemodynamically stable
   - r/o flu
   #. ARF - likely prerenal azotemia. IVF overnight. If BUN/Cr continue to
   rise, will send urine lytes.
   #. Leukocytosis - either secondary to infection or perhaps due to
   dexamethasone. Will hold off on antibiotics until there is a clear
   source or if patient decompensates.
   #. Elevated troponin - no EKG changes. This is likely in the setting of
   hypotension and ARF. Can complete ROMI, but low probability for ACS.
   #. Multiple Myeloma - multiple myeloma for which he takes dexamethasone
   weekly on a regular basis.  He gets most of his medications as well as
   labs done at the VA and his oncologist is at [**Hospital3 **].  He recently
   has been having problems with pain in his back and legs.
   #. History of DVT- continue coumadin
   #. Depression - continue citalopram
   #. Benign prostatic hypertrophy - continue finasteride at nighttime.
