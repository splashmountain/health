TITLE: CCU Resident Progress Note
   Chief Complaint: Intubated in CCU
   24 Hour Events:
   - Had full family meeting yesterday with her husband and multiple sons
   and daughters.  The family decided that their first priority is [** **]
   for the patient, and her code status was changed to DNR/DNI.  We
   initially continued to monitor her respiratory status with VBG
   However,  her PCO2 began to climb on her VBG and she appeared to be
   gasping for air and uncomfortable.  She was started on a morphine drip
   (initially at 1mg/hr).  After this, her respirations were much more
   unlabored, she converted to sinus rhythm with rates in the 60-70
s, and
   she was no longer hypertensive.
   - She also had high fevers throughout the day to 104.8, which broke
   with a cooling blanket, Tylenol, and morphine administration.
   - One episode of feeling pain and shortness of breath last evening,
   given 0.5mg Ativan IV which helped calm her down
   - She continues on medications for rate control/rhythm control, as well
   as for her breathing [** **].  Other medications were discontinued, as
   well blood draws.  The family decided against a new central line,
   femoral line was left in for now.
   - Left UE US showed no evidence of DVT on prelim read

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo female h/o DM, HLD, HTN, Afib with RVR, s/p pacemaker and sarcoid
   presents with acute heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema.
   Patient with multiple episodes of AFib with RVR and hypotension since
   admission. She was sent for cath and found to have 2 vessel disease,
   s/p BMS to LAD.  Now extubated and breathing comfortably with morphine
   administration.  She is in and out of Afib with rate 110-130, current
   in sinus or paced rhythm with rate 60-70.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated s/p flash pulmonary edema in OSH;
   possibly secondary to Acute dCHF and complicated by severe pulmonary
   hypertension. Extubated two days ago with increased respiratory
   distress yesterday afternoon requiring treatment with morphine.  BiPap
   was an option yesterday afternoon but with family
s goals of care in
   mind, a morphine drip was started.
   - Doing well this morning with more comfortable breathing
   - Titrate morphine drip as needed for respiratory distress and [**Telephone/Fax (3) **]
   - Continue Xopenex/Iprotroprium nebs Q4Hours as needed
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient now in sinus rhythm, recently in afib with rates in
   the 100s to 130s.
   - Continue Metoprolol 100mg po TID; once she has 5 grams of amio, will
   cut back metoprolol to [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Continue Diltiazem 60mg QID, after 2 doses, will increase Dilt as
   needed for rate control
   - Continue Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Will wean metoprolol to [**Hospital1 7**] at 5 grams of amiodorone is in system
   (currently at 1600mg)
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Patient febrile yesterday with rectal temp of
   almost 105.  Likely C Diff in this case, as patient with large smelly
   stool last evening.
   - Will pull femoral line today for [**Hospital1 **] and for infection prevention
   - FU cultures
   - Continue fever treatments as needed with Tylenol and cooling blanket
   .
   #Neuro Status: Sedation stopped ([**8-10**]). Pt appears to be slowly
   improving and more lucid with administration of morphine.
   - Follow neuro status
   # Left arm swelling
 possible DVT?
   - Will get left upper extremity swelling
   # CORONARIES: NSTEMI: 2 vessel disease s/p BMS to the mid LAD.
   - Have stopped Plavix 75 mg Daily, Simvastatin 80 mg daily, and ASA 325
   mg Daily
   - Continue Metoprolol 100mg TID for rate control
   - Continue Captopril 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 7**] for blood pressure control
   .
   # Hypertension
 typically okay BP
s when not in respiratory distress,
   added Captopril yesterday.
   - will watch, possible increase in Captopril today in necessary and not
   improving with increased dose of Diltiazem
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved after 2L of D5W. Pt had a 4L Free Water
   deficit.
   - Have stopped labs and fluid repletion
   .
   # Diabetes type 2: Patient recently on insulin drip, now fingersticks
   have stopped in light of goals of care.
   .
   # PUMP: EF of >55% per TTE. Patient even over the last 24 hours. Dose
   not appear to be volume overloaded on exam.
   .
   # Anemia: Last Hct 27, stool guaiac positive.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Crt stable at 0.9. Most likely secondary to
   hypotension in setting of afib rvr.  FeUrea 8.16% is consistent with
   pre renal etiology..
   # Sarcoidosis: On home O2 3LNC; currently stable; patient intubated
   .
   # Dyslipidemia: Lipid panel shows TC 157, TG: 156 HDL 30 LDLc 96; Not
   optimal HDL/LDL level
   - Have stopped zetia and simvastatin for now
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - have stopped Synthroid at 25 mcg daily
   # Depression:
   - Have stopped Paroxetine 10 mg daily, consider restarting in a few
   days if patient
   # GERD:
   -  Have stopped famotidine
