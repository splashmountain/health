Studies:

CXR [**2628-1-1**]
PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The patient is status
post median
sternotomy and CABG. Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette size
is difficult due to the presence of a chronic, moderate-to-large
left pleural effusion, which appears slightly increased in size
when compared to prior study. There is persistent left basilar
opacification, likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. The
right lung demonstrates mild atelectasis at the lung base, but
is otherwise clear. No pneumothorax is identified. There is no
pulmonary vascular congestion. The aorta remains tortuous and
calcified.

IMPRESSION: Moderate-to-large chronic left pleural effusion,
slightly
increased compared to the prior study with persistent left
basilar
opacification, likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, though
infection
cannot be completely excluded.

CXR [**2628-1-3**]:
FINDINGS: Sternotomy wires are unchanged. The heart and
mediastinal contours are within normal limits and stable. There
has been interval decrease in a left-sided pleural effusion with
some persisting left basilar atelectasis.  The right lung is
clear. A line between the posterior aspects of the left third
and fourth rib space is more compatible with a skin fold rather
than the visceral pleura of the lung, so pneumothorax is not
favored. However, given the recent instrumentation, if growing
clinical concern for pneumothorax exists, short-interval
followup may be considered.

LENI [**2628-1-2**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.


Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 27729**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man with PMH significant for
multiple hospitalizations for PNA, CAD status post CABG [**8-/2620**],
peripheral arterial disease, chronic kidney disease, baseline
creatinine 1.0-1.3, HTN, GERD, VitB12 deficiency, history of
mild COPD, presented to ED with fevers, and weakness as well as
SOB. He was initially in respiratory distress in monitored in
the ICU overnight. He was quickly transitioned to the medicine
floor and on nasal cannula. He was treated for
community-acquired pneumonia, and he clinically improved. He was
discharged to rehabilitation.

Active issues:

#. Fevers, cough: Likely secondary to community acquired
pneumonia. On admission patient had cough, fevers, elevated WBC.
CXR unchanged from prior and still showed pleural effusions.
Etiolgy was likely bacterial vs viral pneumonia. He was treated
with Ceftriaxone/Levaquin to cover for CAP in ICU setting. He
was given albuterol/Ipratropium standing NEBS. Suspicion low for
PE, d-dimer was elevated but LENIs were negative. He was treated
empirically with Tamiflu initially but discontinued once DFA
negative. He had a thoracentesis on [**1-3**] that was exudative by
light's criteria, though culture and gram stain were negative.
He was continued on Levofloxacin on the floors and continued to
improve. He was discharged on planned 10 day course of
Levofloxacin. He required 2L NC on discharge (sats 96%), which
should be weaned as able on at rehab. If he was unable to be
weaned to room air after treatment for pneumonia, recommend
consideration of gentle diuresis (pt received fluids while
admitted and lasix initially held).

# Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline Cr 1.1-1.3, up to
1.4, improved with fluids to 1.1 on day prior to discharge,
therefore likely pre-renal. His lasix was initially held, and
restarted the day prior to discharge.

# Aspiration: Pt found to be aspirating on bedside evaluation
with speech and swallow. Aspiration precautions were maintained.
Recommend that patient have formal video swallow after
resolution of his pneumonia.

Inactive issues:

#. Type 2 diabetes: He has a slowly rising hemoglobin A1c (7.8
from 6/[**2627**]).  Had been diet controlled until [**Month (only) **] of last
year.  He was written for an insulin sliding scale while on the
medical floors, and required around 8 units Humalog daily for BG
high 100s-200. Pt will require follow-up with this PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] if
he continues to have elevated BG may require oral medications.
This was not started in house given concern for hypoglycemia in
this patient with significant coronary artery disease.

# CAD status post CABG [**8-/2620**]: Continued on home ASA. No longer
on statin.

# HTN: Continued on amlodipine. His lasix was restarted at 10mg
daily the day prior to discharge (held briefly given pre-renal
ARF as discussed above).

# GERD: Pt was changed from prilosec to lansoprazole for ease of
taking given aspiration as discussed above.

# Vitamin B12 deficinecy: Continued home Vitamin B12.

Discharge Instructions:
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. [**Known patient lastname 27729**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you during this admission. You
were admitted with fevers and shortness of breath. You were
initially in the ICU, but moved to the medicine floors shortly
thereafter. You were placed on antibiotics and you improved. You
were seen by the speech specialists, and you were found to be
aspirating, so you were placed on a special diet. You will
benefit from further evaluation with a video swallow after your
pneumonia improves.

The following medications were changed during this
hospitalization:
1. START Levofloxacin 500mg by mouth for 5 more days (to be
completed [**2628-1-11**])
2. START Guaifenesin 10 mL by mouth every 6 hours until cough
improves
3. START Insulin per sliding scale while at rehab (only during
the day, may hold at night)
4. Take Albuterol nebulizer 1 neb every 4 hours until your
breathing improves (only during the day, may hold at night)
5. Take Ipratropium nebulizer 1 neb every 6 hours until your
breathing improves (you can then change back to as needed)
6. CHANGE the medication Omeprazole 20mg daily to Lansoprazole
30mg daily
7. START Docusate sodium twice daily for constipation
8. TAKE Bisacodyl and senna as needed for constipation

You were found to have Type 2 Diabetes earlier this year with
your primary doctor. You have not yet been started on oral
medications for this. In the hospital we had you on a gentle
insulin sliding scale for high blood sugars, but you required
only small doses. If your blood sugars continue to be high, you
may need to start a medication for this. Please discuss this
further with your primary doctor at your follow-up appointment.

Please continue the other medications you were taking prior to
this admission.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow-up with the following appointments:

We cannot schedule primary care appointments when you go to
rehab. Please call your doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 247**]
when you are discharged from rehabilitation. The speech
therapists recommended that you have a video swallow evaluation
when you are discharged. Please discuss this with him if this is
not done at rehab.
