History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 50 year old R handed man in his usual state of
health today when he left home at 12pm today for a bike ride on
a
new bike. Shortly before 2pm, he was found lying next to his
bike, confused, speaking, but not making sense. D-stick 98 at
the
scene. Brought to the ED, taken to head CT at 2pm due to
concerns
for head trauma vs stroke. Neurology paged, arrived to ED at
approximately 2:05pm, Pt in CT scanner. NIH stroke scale total
score at ~2:15 = 6. Clear deficits included fluent aphasia, R
lower facial droop, extinction on R c/w L MCA stroke. Labs sent
at 2:30pm. Hypertensive to 188/93; received Hydralazine 10mg x1
with good effect. tPA was pushed at 2:55pm (7mg push, 62mg over
1 hour). No significant change during re-examination towards end

of tPA infusion. Admitted to ICU for further workup.

.
CT brain without IV contrast ([**7-24**]):
No prior studies.
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally
midline structures, or hydrocephalus. [**Doctor Last Name 85**]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. Soft tissues and osseous
structures are unremarkable. Minimal mucosal thickening is seen
within the ethmoid air cells.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
.
EEG ([**7-24**]):This is a possibly abnormal portable EEG obtained in
wakefulness and stage II sleep due to the presence of mildly
disorganized background and voltage reduction over the entire
left
hemisphere only in wakefulness. The significance of this finding
is
unclear. There were no epileptiform discharges seen.

.
Carotid series ([**7-24**]):Minimal plaque with bilateral less than
40% carotid stenosis. Of note, the left vertebral artery appears
occluded.
.
TEE ([**7-26**]):Possible transpulmonary shunt. No cardiac source of
embolism
identified.
.
LENI ([**7-26**]): No evidence of lower extremity deep vein
thrombosis, bilaterally.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the neurology intensive care unit
for further monitoring after his t-PA administration.  He was
placed initially on cardiac telemetry and ruled out for an acute
myocardial infarction.  He was transferred from the ICU to a
regular floor bed on [**7-25**].  He had a transesophageal
echocardiogram that was only significant for a possible small
transpulmonary shunt.  A carotid US study was negative for
stenosis, and an ultrasound of the legs was negative.  His lipid
panel showed elevated cholesterol.  An EEG was performed that
showed no epileptiform activity.  His aphasia slowly improved
during the hospitalization.  His NIHSS score upon discharge was
2.  He was given instructions to arrange outpatient speech
therapy.  He was discharged with instructions to stop aspirin in
5 days while increasing aggrenox to [**Hospital1 12**] permanently.  An
appointment was made to have the patient follow up in stroke
clinic in one month.
