TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:  Fever, hypoxia
   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known patient firstname 1025**] [**Known patient lastname 13070**] is a 55 year old man with history of left cerebellar
   stroke, R temporal lobe astrocytoma and recurrent meningiomas s/p
   resection, seizure disorder, PE in [**10-12**] on Coumadin, hypertension, and
   urosepsis presents from his nursing home with fever and hypoxia.
   Patient is alert but nonverbal at baseline.  Per his wife he normally
   waxes / wanes in his ability to interact, on good days he is able to
   maintain eye contact, have minimal movement and make sounds but not
   formulate words.  He has been less interactive since 3 days prior to
   admission.  Per the wife he did not localize anything specific,
   although he did seem to have pain when his head was moved.  By his
   nursing home staff he was found today to be markedly less responsive,
   in addition he was found to be tachycardic and hypoxic to the 80s on
   room air.  He was started on 8L NC and his oxygenation did not improve,
   he was given 1 gram of tylenol prior to his arrival to the ER.
   .
   Of note, patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 17**] [**3140-2-28**] after
   admission for urosepsis. This admission was complicated by altered
   mental status found to represent increased seizure activity in the
   setting of sepsis as well as acute renal failure believed to be
   prerenal and intrinsic from antibiotic therapy.  During this recent
   admission he developed a coagulopathy that initially required vitamin K
   and subsequently a lovenox bridge to acheive goal INR. He had
   significant dysphagia that required a restricted diet and NGT feedings.
   He was discharged to an LTAC with instructions to complete a 2 week
   course of Unasyn (for Aerococcus viridans positive urine cx [**3140-2-17**]).
   Since his discharge he underwent G-tube placement.
   .
   In the ED, initial VS: T 98.4 Rectal 103.6 HR 124 BP 108/73 RR 28 SpO2
   95% on NRB.   His WBC was noted to be 47.6 with 2% bands.  He was given
   vancomycin and zosyn, ibuprofen, and lovenox 60mg SQ. He received at
   total of 4L NS.
   .
   Vitals prior to transfer, HR 97 BP 99/72 RR 18 SpO2 99% on NRB.
   He underwent CXR which revealed possible LLL infiltrate (my read).  His
   U/a was negative.

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   55 yoM w/ baseline neurologic deficts related astrocytoma/meningioma
   resections and previous CVA [**2-6**] XRT, nursing home resident, presents
   with fever, leukocytosis, hypoxia and tachycardia.
   .
   #  Sepsis: Leukocytosis, fever, tachycardia, and hypotension on
   presentation with several possible sources of infection.  Most likely
   source currently being pulmonary with a LLL infiltrate, hypoxia,
   increased sputum production and aspiration risk. Other sources of
   infection include recent GI procedure (G-tube placement), recent PICC
   line, decubitus ulcer, C. diff given recent antibiotic course, and
   urosepsis as patient has a history of recurrent UTIs.  Will evaluate
   for intraabdominal source such as C. diff or cholecystitis given high
   grade leukocytosis and abdominal tenderness.  Decubitus coccygeal ulcer
   is also present and remains a possible source of infection, though
   currently does not appear to be the primary contributor to his
   presentation.
   -obtain LFTs
   -serial abdominal exams
   -f/u final read of CXR
   -obtain ECHO
   -follow up blood/urine culture
   -send sputum culture
   -repeat Lactate
   -currently hemodynamically stable, will place foley to monitor UOP
   -s/p 3L IVF, continue steady bolus for tachycardia, hypotension or low
   UOP
   -continue empiric abx- had recently rec'd unasyn so will use cefepime
   (rather than zosyn started in ED) and vancomycin
   -currently no central line, the patient currently has 2 x 18g PIVs and
   is hemodynamically stable, JVP appears to be 10cm so will defer CVL for
   now.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Likely secondary to pneumonia given increased sputum
   production, risk of aspiration, and fever. Early ARDS less likely based
   on CXR.  Hypoxia largely resolved with deep suctioning on arrival to
   the unit.
   -obtain ABG
   -attempt to wean O2 to assess O2 requirement
   -f/u final read of CXR
   -repeat CXR in am after fluid resuscitation
   -send sputum
   .
   # ARF- Baseline Cr is 1-1.2.  Currently 1.6 and oliguric.  Assuming
   prerenal etiology as patient appear clinically dry and hypoperfused.
   - place foley
   - send urine lytes
   - oliguria appears to be fluid responsive
   .
   #  Altered Mental Status: Very poor baseline cognitive reserve
   secondary to strokes, meningioma, astrocytoma, brain and tumor
   resections, exacerbated by current infection.  Monitor as he is being
   treated for infection.
   .
   # h/o seizure disorder: continue Keppra, renally dose.  (was on 1g [**Hospital1 **],
   will start with 500mg IV bid and adjust based on renal function).
   .
   # h/o PE: on coumadin at home, will hold coumadin as may require
   procedures. Given lovenox in ER, will hold off on that for now as his
   hypoxia seems to be related to PNA versus aspiration.  Start heparin
   gtt when INR subtherapeutic.
   .
   # Goals of Care: Patient currently full code per wife.  She would like
   to discuss goals of care with their son and readdress tomorrow.  She
   was offered social work and palliative care and expressed interest in
   meeting with both groups.
   .
   # FEN: IVFs / replete lytes prn / NPO
   # PPX: PPI, INR therapeutic, continue wound care
   # ACCESS: 18 g PIV x 2
   # CODE: FULL  though wife would like to further discuss
   # CONTACT:  Wife
   # ICU CONSENT:
   # DISPO: ICU
