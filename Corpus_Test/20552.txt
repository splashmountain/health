Intra-op TEE [**3204-9-13**]
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is
markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened (?#). There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A mitral valve
annuloplasty ring is present. The mitral annular ring appears
well seated with normal gradient. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. A well-seated bioprosthetic tricuspid valve is present.
The leaflets open well (gradient was not assessed). Mild
tricuspid regurgitation is suggested through a paravalvular
leak. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**3204-9-11**],
the right ventricular cavity size is slightly smaller, with
similar systolic function and severity of tricuspid
regurgitation. A similar aortic valve gradient is obtained on
the current study which is not suggestive of aortic valve
stenosis.




Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was taken to the operating room on [**3204-9-8**] and
underwent a redo sternotomy and tricuspid valve replacement with
a 31-mm Mosaic tissue valve.  See operative notes for full
details.  Post operatively she was extubated on post operative
day 1.  She was weaned off epinephrine, levophed and continued
on Vasopressin for several days.  She developed hyponatremia and
Vasopressin was switched to Neosynephrine.  This was weaned off
by post operative 5.  She developed post operative atrial
fibrillation and was started on Amiodarone and was rate
controlled atrial fibrillation at the time of discharge.  She
was anticoagulated with Coumadin for A fib and INR is to be
followed at rehab with a goal of [**1-14**].  She was followed by
hepatology for elevated liver function tests preopoeratively
which were thought to be due to liver congestion.  These were
trending down at the time of discharge.  She became oliguric
post operatively and the nephrology service was consulted.  She
had acute kidney failure on top of chronic renal insufficency.
She responded minially to Lasix bolus and drips and creatinine
peaked at 2.6.  She had a PA catheter replaced on post operative
day 5 to assess fluid status.  She started to respond to
diuresis with lasix and creatinine decreased to 1.1 at the time
of discharge. Her pleural chest tubes were left in due to high
drainage and the left pleural chest tube was pulled post
operative day 9 and the right chest tube was removed post
operative day 10. Pacing wires were removed without incidence.
On post operative day 11 she was transferring to the chair with
assistance and physical therapy continued to work with her to
improve strength and endurance.  Her incisions were healing well
and she was tolerating a full po diet with strong encouragement.
 She was felt safe for discharge to [**Hospital1 **] at [**Hospital 240**] rehab
at this time.
