HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9124**] is a 75-year-old man
with known coronary artery disease status post coronary
artery bypass grafting x 3 in [**2933**].  The patient underwent
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left
anterior descending coronary artery last month due to
recurrent angina.  The patient presented on [**2942-5-20**] to an
outside hospital with increased chest pain.  Cardiac
catheterization showed tortuous but patent left internal
mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending coronary
artery.  An attempt to stent the left anterior descending
coronary artery was unsuccessful due to restenosis.  The
patient at that time had 3/10 chest pain on IV heparin and
nitroglycerin drip.  The patient had increased ST segment
elevation in V2 and V3.  The patient had a left ventricular
ejection fraction of 50%.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Coronary artery bypass grafting x 3
in [**2933**].  2. Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.  3.
Hypercholesterolemia.  4. Status post prostate surgery.  5.
Status post hernia repair.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco or alcohol history.

Glucophage 1,000 mg b.i.d.  3. Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg
q.d.  4. Cozaar 50 mg q.d.  5. Imdur 60 mg q.d.  6. Plavix 75

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Neurological:  Awake, alert.  Neck:
No carotid bruits noted.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1
and S2, no murmurs noted.  Abdomen:  Benign.  Extremities:
Warm, no edema, no varicosities.  Previous saphenous vein
harvest per the right leg visible.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2942-5-22**] with a
diagnosis of a small myocardial infarct.  On [**2942-5-25**] the
patient was taken to the operating room where a redo coronary
artery bypass grafting was performed within left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery,
saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and saphenous vein
graft to posterior descending coronary artery.
Postoperatively the patient required a propofol drip.  He was
transferred to the cardiothoracic surgical intensive care
unit in good condition.  He had chest tubes and pacing wires
in place.  Postoperatively the patient was started on beta
blockers, Imdur and Plavix, as well as Losartan, isosorbide
and Lasix.  At the appropriate times the patient's chest
tubes and pacing wires were removed.

In the intensive care unit the patient experienced a
short-lived increase in creatinine.  Otherwise his stay in
the intensive care unit was relatively uneventful.  The
patient was transferred to the regular cardiothoracic floor
where he continued to do well.  He was visited by physical
therapy who over the course of the patient's stay here were
pleased with his progress and cleared him to be discharged
home.

It is now [**2942-5-29**].  It is anticipated that the patient will
be discharged today provided that he voids post Foley
catheter removal.  If so the patient will be discharged in
good condition.

FOLLOW UP:  He was to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in
four weeks, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26111**] [**Name (STitle) 4318**] in one to two weeks, and
