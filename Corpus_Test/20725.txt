Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old gentleman
admitted to the CCU following catheterization for an ST
elevation MI.  The patient was home at rest when 2:00 pm of
admission noted acute onset of substernal chest pain
associated with shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting,
diaphoresis.  He presented to the [**Hospital1 **] Emergency Room at
4:00 and noted to have ST elevations in V1 through V4 and
reciprocal inferior depressions, given IV Nitroglycerin,
morphine, Plavix, aspirin without resolution of the pain, and
transferred emergently to [**Hospital1 68**] for cath.

In the cath lab, his RA pressure was 14, PA 51/27, pulmonary
wedge pressure 25.  He had a thrombotic occlusion in the
proximal LAD and stenotic distal LAD about 90% which were
treated with Hepacoat bare metal stents.  Also noted to have
an 80% lesion of the mid left circumflex and co-dominant
right RCA with proximal PDA lesion which was not intervened
on.  The patient required dopamine and Neo drips, as well as
intra-arterial balloon pump.  The patient had runs of VT and
was started on lidocaine drip.  The patient had temporary
pacing wires placed, rate of 60.  The patient was started on
bivalirudin and low dose heparin for anticoagulation.  On
admission to the CCU, the patient was pain-free and
comfortable, and no shortness of breath, chest pain, cough,
lightheadedness, on lido, dopa, neo, heparin, bivalirudin
drips.

muscles were intact.  Pupils equal, round, reactive to light.
No lymphadenopathy.  JVP at about 8 cm.  Regular,

sounds, soft, nontender.  The balloon pump was audible
throughout.  Groin was negative by cath lab report.

groin.  Intra-arterial balloon pump in the right groin.  No
hematoma or bruits.  Neuro exam was awake, alert and oriented
x 3.  Cranial nerves - III was weak on the left.  Otherwise,
cranial nerves were intact.

LABS AT OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  White count 10.4, hematocrit 44.7,
platelets 179, INR 1.35, sodium 135, K 4.4, chloride 100,
bicarb 23, BUN 20, creatinine 1.0, glucose 383, calcium 9.6.
Cardiac cath results - Again, right atrial pressure 14, PA
pressure 51/27, wedge pressure 25, cardiac output/cardiac
index 4.2 and 2.2, SVR 1448.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was a 65-year-old gentleman, with an
ST elevation MI of the LAD, now admitted with cardiogenic
shock.

1) CAD:  He was stable after cath on bivalirudin and heparin.
His enzymes were followed, and he was continued on aspirin,
anticoagulation and Plavix for his recent stent.  He was also
continued on his statin which was titrated to a maximal dose
which he tolerated fine.  The patient remained chest pain
free throughout the course of his stay, status post stent. He
subsequently underwent stenting of the LCX and RCA.

2) CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:  The patient initially came in under
cardiogenic shock and was initially on Neo-Synephrine and
dopamine drips, in addition to the interatrial balloon pump,
which he tolerated well.  Eventually, these were weaned off,
and the patient's blood pressures remained stable.
Eventually, the patient had an echocardiogram which showed an
ejection fraction of [**11-20**]%, and the patient was started on
vasodilators and beta blockers for his cardiac regimen, as he was
off pressors, and his blood pressure was stable.  He was
initially started on low dose ACE and low dose Toprol XL, and
was started on Coumadin for prophylaxis for LV thrombus, in
light of his large MI and decreased wall motion abnormality.
The patient will actually go home on Lovenox, as he will
return for an ICD placement per the electrophysiology team
secondary to his low EF and episodes of NSVT.

3) ARRHYTHMIAS:  The patient did have a run of V. tach
secondary to his MI.  He was otherwise stable, but then
throughout the course of his stay he had recurrent episodes
of NSVT, and plans were made per electrophysiology team to
return in 3 week's time to have an ICD placed.

4) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  This was new onset likely secondary
to his MI and worsening heart failure.  The patient did have
an episode of atrial tachycardia during the course of his
stay which did respond to low dose beta blockers, and again
the patient will return for ICD placement.  No plans for an
EP study at this time.  The patient was also started and
loaded on digoxin which he will continue.  VT post MI - he
was initially on lido drip secondary to this and this was
weaned, and the patient's VT remained stable.

5) DIABETES:  Patient with poor glucose control throughout
the course of his stay.  Eventually was restarted on his home
regimen which was titrated up, and this can be continued to
be monitored closely upon DC.

For patient' atrial fibrillation, he was converted with
amiodarone and milrinone which was eventually discontinued.
Amiodarone was eventually weaned off as well, and the patient
remained in sinus with occasional episodes of atrial
tachycardia as described above.

The patient was seen by physical therapy and recommended
continued rehabilitation for deconditioning after his MI.
The patient will go for cardiac rehab.

6) ANEMIA:  The patient had a history of GI bleed and was
transfused over the course of his stay to keep a goal
hematocrit greater than 30.  This remained stable over the
course of his stay.
7. Thrombocytopenia: resolved after unfractionated heparin was
discontinued.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.  Patient ambulating without
difficulty, not requiring oxygen.  Deconditioned requiring
cardiac rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge to cardiac rehab.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. ST elevation myocardial infarction.
2. Arrhythmias - ventricular tachycardia, atrial tachycardia,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia.
