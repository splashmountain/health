   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7430**] is a 56 yo male with diabetes, hypertension, crohn's
   disease, on steroids, who is admitted with submassive PE and
   respiratory failure requring intubation.
   .
   Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient has massive clot burden on CTA with
   significant hypoxia (PAO2 is only 130s in spite of 100% oxygen) upon
   presentation.  Patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT
   chest, and EKG.  Tropononin mildly elevated and BNP is markedly
   elevated.  Given recent GI bleeding due to crohn's disease, concern for
   use of TPA would be GI bleed and intracranial hemorrhage.  Patient is
   s/p 140 mg SC of lovenox at OSH and now s/p lysis with marked
   improvement of respiratory status.
   - heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100
   - PS support trial with plan to extubate later today
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   - type and cross 6 units of PRBCs
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient is a type two diabetic on glargine and [**Known patient lastname 5487**].
   Given steroid use, will likely become significantly hyperglycemic.
   - [**Last Name (LF) 5487**], [**First Name3 (LF) 114**] consider long acting insulin if improved
   .
   Crohns.  Patient has recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease.  Most recent
   colonoscopy in [**5-26**] showed significant colonic inflammation.  He was
   observed in the MICU for GI bleed, but did not requiring blood
   transfusiosn.  He was put on prednisone taper at discharge.  Recently
   had worsening of symptoms with steroid taper so had to go up on
   prednisone dose from 15 to 17 last week.  Now with marroon colored
   stool in setting of s/p lysis and being on heparin drip.
   - stress dose steroids given that patient is on chronic steroids and is
   now critically ill; additionally, this might offer colonic protection
   in the setting of heparin bolus/drip and s/p tpa
   - type and crossed for 6 units
   - q 4-6 hour hcts
   .
   .
   Hypotension.  Likely related to massive PE.  Low CVPs suggest
   hypovelmia as well.
   - hold antihypertensives
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   .
   Renal failure.  Patient's recent Cr in our system have ranged from 1.3
   to 2.0 so current value is within his range of normal.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow Cr
   .
   Leukocytosis.  Likely related to chronic steroid use.  No clear sign of
   infection.
   - monitor wbc, fever curve
   .
