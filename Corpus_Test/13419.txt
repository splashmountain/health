Brief Hospital Course:
Ms.  [**Known patient lastname **] ?????? was admitted to the Orthopedic service on [**2757-1-17**]
for right hip fracture after being evaluated and treated with
closed reduction in the emergency room.  She underwent open
reduction internal fixation of the fracture without complication
on [**2757-1-17**]. Please see operative report for full details. She
was extubated without difficulty and transferred to the recovery
room in stable condition.  In the early post-operative course
she did well and was transferred to the floor in stable
condition. On HD3 she developed atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response.

#Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate - In the
post-op period, the patient developed Afib with RVR and was
transferred to the CCU.  Chemical cardioversion was first
attempted with ibutilide which did not permanently restore sinus
rhythm.  She was subsequently electrically cardioverted the next
day with 200J and maintained sinur rhythm until discharge.  She
will require anticoagulation with warfarin for 4-6 weeks after
the cardioversion.  She was also started on Metoprolol
Succinate.

#Transitional issues:
-Will need anticoagulation with warfarin at goal INR [**3-8**] for [**5-9**]
weeks after discharge

On hospital day 4 she was transfused 2 U PRBC for post-operative
anemia. On HD5 she started complaining of blisters and pain in
her mouth. She was started on Nystatin mouthwash and Acyclovir
ointment. She was aslo evaluated by speach and swallow consult
who recommended:

1- PO diet: thin liquids/soft solids (advance to regular when
mouth sores heal at RN's discretion)
2- Repeat bedside eval is not necessary for an upgraded diet
3- PO meds: whole with thin liquid
4- TID oral care

She had adequate pain management and worked with physical
therapy while in the hospital.  The remainder of her hospital
course was uneventful and she is being discharged to rehab in
stable condition.

On discharge, we have started calcium carbonate and vitamin d
800 IU daily. In addition, we are recommending that alendronate
sodium 70mg qweek is started two weeks after discharge. Clinical
trial data supports that two weeks following fracture is a safe
time to initiate bisphosphonates and it should not interfere
with bone healing. Patients who have been treated with
bisphosphonates starting at two weeks following fracture have
been shown to have decreased incidence of recurrent fracture and
decreased overall mortality.
While bisphosphonates are indicated and safe for most patients
with osteoporosis related fractures, there are exceptions.
Contraindications to bisphosphonates include renal failure with
creatinine clearance less than 35 ml/minute, esophageal
dysmotility including strictures or achalasia, active
esophagitis or gastritis, esophageal or gastric ulcers,
hypocalcemia, or inability to comply with dosing instructions.
Please note that controlled GERD is NOT a contraindication to
bisphosphonates. While we have ordered this medication on
discharge, it is up to your discretion to discontinue it if you
feel that it is contraindicated for your patient. For the
majority of patients at average risk of suffering an
osteoporosis related fracture, the current data supports
treatment with bisphosphonates for a total of five years.
