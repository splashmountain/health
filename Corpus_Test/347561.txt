   Assessment and Plan
   85F with a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure and restrictive lung
   disease who had a STEMI now s/p cath and POBA to the mid-LAD.
   # CORONARIES:  3VD on cath.  ECG changes at presentation consistent
   with inferior STEMI; also with old anterior q-waves.  Per family, no
   CABG at this time, CT surgery agrees.  Medical management for now, will
   consider further possibility of stenting further.
   - Continue with aspirin, carvedilol, and simvastatin
   - Plavix 75mg QD
   - Holding Lisinopril given worsening renal function
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 3.0  today.  Likely secondary
   to contrast-induced nephropathy given that this is 4 days post-cath and
   patient had significant dye load.  The patient did not respond to
   metolazone/laxix 120 and metolazone/lasix 160 yesterday.  A renal US
   showed no hydronephrosis; the Doppler study was limited.  The patient
   was oliguirc overnight; however her UOP was picking up this am.
   - Appreciate renal consult, will f/u recs
   - As the UOP started to increase this am, will give 5 mg of metolazone
   and start a lasix gtt while closely monitoring her UOP.
   - anticipate resolution over next few days
   - Continue holding her acei.
   # PULM:  Intubated in the cath lab given decreasing sats and pO2. Now
   extubated after diuresis.  Appears to having worsening pulmonary status
   requiring higher O2 requirements and is not making urine, likely
   secondary to ATN from contrast.
   - diurese as above
   - check CXR
   - continue COPD inhalers (combivent)
   - If her respiratory status worsens will discuss with renal to consider
   HD for volume removal.
   # UTI: Patient with positive UA and urine cultures growing out
   enterococcus.  Patient had been started on ceftriaxone yesterday before
   the urine culture returned, but given the enterococcus will switch to
   amoxicillin.
   - F/u enterococcus sensitivities.
   # PUMP:  Known to have chronic diastolic CHF with initial presentation
   was consistent with overload, likely an acute decompensation.  For LOS
   she is 1.8 L negative.
   - Continue carvedilol
   - Holding Lisinopril as above.
   - will attempt to diurese as above.
   # RHYTHM:  Nl sinus rhythm.
   - Monitor on tele
   # DIABETES:  Continue with home NPH with HISS.  Will follow blood
   sugars.
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine
   FEN:  cardiac diet, replete lytes as needed
   ACCESS: PIV's x2; will have a PICC placed for long term IV access
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   -Bowel regimen
   CODE: Full code.  Discussed with family.
   DISPO: unit for now given renal dysfunction
