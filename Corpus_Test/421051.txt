 NUCLEAR MEDICINE - At [**3268-7-22**] 04:00 AM
   Has received 5 units PRBCs since presentation to the ED, without
   appropriate increase in Hct. 2 small maroon-colored BM; no BRBPR.
   Non-con CT scan prelim read of abd/pelvis showed b/l pleural effusions
   without retroperitonal or intraperitoneal bleed; radiologist read as
   nodule potentially consistent with diverticulitis.  Subsequently, he
   underwent a tagged RBC study performed this AM, which was negative for
   bleed.  Started on meropenem for UTI (history of ESBLs.)

   Imaging: CT abdomen and pelvis [**3268-7-22**]: .
   1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
   2. Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with
   adjacent
   basilar atelectasis.
   3. 1.4 cm soft tissue density which appears to be contiguous with the
   transverse colon and may represent an inflamed diverticulum with a
   small
   amount of stranding adjacent to it.
   4. Extensive atherosclerotic disease of the descending aorta and branch
   vessels.
   CXR: Interval increase to perihilar opacities bilaterally and right
   pleural effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
   Assessment and Plan: 78 year old male with a past medical history
   significant for DM, HTN, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, hx
   tachy-brady s/p pacemaker, ESRD on HD s/p recent ex-lap for small bowel
   obstruction with evidence of lower GI bleed.
   1)  Lower GI Bleed: known diverticular disease, given neg NG lavage in
   ED upper GI bleed less likely. Received 5 units PRBC
 Hct 25.5
   27.9
28.7
 29.3
 30.6. Negative tagged RBC scan and maroon-colored
   stool suggests non-brisk bleed, and stabilization of Hct suggests
   resolution of active bleed.
   - Check Hct Q6H
   - Transfuse to keep HCT >28
   - Continue PPI daily
   - F/u surgery and GI recs
   2) Acute Blood Loss Anemia on Chronic Anemia: GI bleed, but baseline
   HCT 25-30 likely due to ESRD and anemia of chronic disease.
   - Trend Hct as above
   3) Elevated troponin, now stable. Stable CK. Likely represents demand
   ischemia in the setting of ESRD with decreased renal clearance of
   troponin. Since troponin has stabilized in the past 24hrs, and he lacks
   a clinical syndrome consistent with ACS, we will withhold further
   collection of cardiac enzymes at this time.
   4) UTI: On Meropenem given history of ESBLs. We can consider narrowing
   coverage pending identification of pathogen on UCx.
   -Cont Meropenem day 1 of [**6-22**].
   -Follow up UCx .
   5) ESRD: On dialysis MWF. Current evidence of fluid overload but with
   maintenance of adequate Sp02.
   - Follow up with renal regarding HD.
   - Continue nephrocaps, renagel
   - Darbopoetin at the time of HD
   6) Soft tissue density on CT suspicious for diverticulitis.  However,
   he lacks symptoms consistent with diverticulitis such as focal
   abdominal pain at this time. Although indicated for UTI, his current
   regimen of meropenem would provide coverage of the most common bacteria
   associated with diverticulitis (GNR and anaerobes); however, we would
   not continue meropenem for diverticulitis coverage if UCx allows for
   the use of a more targeted abx given lack of clinical evidence of
   diverticulitis.
   7) DM
   -- Continue HISS
   6) Atrial fibrillation, s/p ablation, now paced.
   -- Continue amiodarone.
   --Continue to hold warfarin, aspirin and BB held in setting of bleed.
   7) HTN:
   --Continue to hold antihypertensives in setting GI bleed
   8)  Dyslipidemia:
   --Continue simvastatin

   # Access: peripherals and central line
   -- subclavian central line appears to be from last discharge [**7-12**], in
