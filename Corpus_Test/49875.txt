History of Present Illness:
HPI: Patient is a 53 year old RHW with hx of
fibromyalgia,hypothyroidism and depression here with several
months R arm numbness found to have large spinal mass near T1 at
an outside imaging facility.Patient reports that she developed
tightness sensation that radiated down from her neck to R arm
more medially since [**Month (only) 201**]. She describes that it felt like a BP
cuff tightening her arm which loosened within seconds followed
by some tingling sensation.  This was intermittent and possibly
more intense 3 months ago when it started than now.  She then
felt that she has been getting weaker on her R arm.  Although
she can't describe any specific things that she is no longer
able to do, she feels that she has been using her L hand more
because she is weaker on her R arm than L.She denies any trauma
or injury.  Upon more probing, she feels that her husband
noticed that she occasionally wobbled while walking.  Possibly
more to the R but no falls or brushing against the wall.  She
denies any numbness or weakness in her legs.  She does have hx
of headaches/migraines and is on Imitrex as needed.She feels
that she may have been getting more frequent headaches than
before but no nausea/vomiting or visual problems. She was
diagnosed with fibromyalgia 3~4 years ago after complaining of
severe hand pain especially in her thumbs.  She also had some
leg throbbing that improved with starting Cymbalta for her
"fibromyalgia."  She was on 60 mg until several months ago but
then she developed some trouble going to the bathroom. She felt
that she had trouble initiating urination and her PCP decreased
the dose to 30 mg without too much relief.  She denies any
accidents or abnormal perivaginal sensation but she still feels
that she has hesitancy before urination.  No problems with bowel
including constipation.

ROS otherwise negative including fever, night sweats or
significant weight loss.  She reports possible 15 lb weight gain
over the past year or so.  Of note, she does report mild
numbness of the tongue as if she receive Novocaine for the past
few days.
