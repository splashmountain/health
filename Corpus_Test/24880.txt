[**3133-11-8**] CXR
PA and lateral views of the chest. The endotracheal tube,
nasogastric tube, right internal jugular central venous
catheter, and multiple chest tubes have been removed. There are
very small right and left apical pneumothoraces. The left apical
pneumothorax is unchanged since the previous study. The right
apical pneumothorax appears new. There is a small right pleural
effusion, slightly increased since the previous study. The lungs
appear clear. Heart size is at the upper limit of normal.
Evidence of CABG is again noted. There is no pulmonary edema.

[**3133-11-6**] EKG
Sinus tachycardia. Left anterior fascicular block. Cannot
exclude old inferior myocardial infarction. Incomplete right
bundle-branch block. Poor R wave progression in leads V4-V6.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**3133-11-4**] the tachycardia,
right bundle-branch block and poor R wave progression are new.



Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 68**] on [**3133-11-3**] via transfer from
the [**Hospital1 **] Center for surgical management of her coronary
artery disease. She was worked-up in the usual preoperative
manner and found to be suitable for surgery. On [**3133-11-6**], Ms.
[**Known patient lastname **] was taken to the operating room where she underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels. Postoperatively
she was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring. On postoperative day one, Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1762**]
neurologically intact and was extubated. Plavix was started for
poor distals. She was then transferred to the cardiac surgical
step down unit for further recovery. She was gently diuresed
towards her preoperative weight. The physical therapy service
was consulted for assistance with he postoperative strength and
mobility. Beta blockade and aspirin were resumed. She developed
atrial fibrillation which was converted to normal sinus rhythm
with correction of her electrolytes and increasing her beta
blockade. Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] continued to make steady progress and was
discharged home on postoperative day six. She will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 287**], her cardiologist and her primary care physician
as an outpatient.
