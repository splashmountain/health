   Assessment and Plan
   73 y/o man with CAD, CHF, and refractory ventricular tachycardia with
   MRSA sepsis and endocarditis.
   # MRSA Sepsis and endocarditis of MR ring: Treated with Vancomycin.
   Now stable for >1-2 days off pressers.  Likely source left arm
   thrombophlebitis,
   - will D/C IJ today & culture tip.
   - Daily EKGs
   - [**Month/Day (4) 1571**] on Mon, NPO Sunday night
   - will likely need 6 weeks of IV Vanc
   # Resp status
 expiratory upper airway wheezes, bilateral basal
   crackles but good oxygen saturations
   - Neb treatment and Lasix 80mg IV x 1 today with I/O goal of negative
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1296**]
   - CXR to r/o infectious source for respiratory discomfort
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Due to hypoperfusion during sepsis,
   now improving
   # Ventricular Tachycardia:
   - No episodes, stable on Mexiletine and Amio, beta-blocker
   - Avoiding Compazine for GI intolerance, on Zofran.
   - If goes into VT, give lidocaine 50-100mg bolus then [**1-3**]/min gtt.
   # CAD: On Zetia (intolerant of statins), ASA
   - On Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]
   - Would continue to hold ACEi given renal function
   # Hypertension: S BB but holding Lasix and ACEi until renal function
   stabilizes.
   # DM: RISS
   # UE DVT: confirmed by US, already anticoagulated on coumadin. [**Month (only) 56**] have
   to increase length of Abx treatment if endovascular infection.
   # Abdominal Hematoma: Will hold off on draining based on improvement.
   # Mental status changes: Likely ICY delirium.  Will call out today.
   Would give zyprexa if necessary.
   # FEN: HH, no IVF, lytes prn. NPO for EGD
   # ppx: therapeutic INR.  PPI.
   # Dispo: following [**Last Name (LF) 1571**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be ready for rehab
