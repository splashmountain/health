   Assessment and Plan
   41 year old gentleman with a history of cirrhosis secondary to EtOH +
   HCV, hx of SBP and portal and PAH, w/ recurrent episodes of
   enceophalopathy presents with an episode of encephalopathy without
   clear trigger.  He had no evidence of aspiration, vomiting, or
   inability to protect his airway.  His mental status continues to
   improve. .
   .
   # Recurrent encephalopathy.  Worse overnight with persistent episode of
   encephalopathy.   Ammonia 504.
   - Continue Lactulose with additional doses q1h until large stool output
   - restart Rifaximin
   - Continue Lactobacillus
   - Start erythromycin PO for gut motility
   - Continue SBP PPx w/ Cipro PO
   - Continue Aspiration precautions.
   - NGT back in place
   - [**Month (only) 47**] require intubation if unable to protect airway or becomes
   hypercarbic from OSA during the day
   - Discuss other options with liver team
   .
   # ESLD. [**12-24**] EtOH and HCV. Ascites, peripheral edema, history of
   spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, portal and pulmonary
   hypertension, sleep apnea, and severe encephalopathy.
   - Continue Lactulose as above.
   - Continue Cipro for SBP ppx
   - Continue Nadolol
   - Continue spironolactone, lasix
   - Follow liver recs
   - Discussion about goals of care, transplant list
   .
   # Anemia: Known Grade II varices s/p banding without evidence active
   bleeding and stable Hct. Chronically G+ stool, chronic. No clear
   source.
   - Active type and screen
   - Hct [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Guaiac stools
   - PPI
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: [**12-24**] liver disease. Platelets within baseline.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine 88mcg PO daily.
   .
   # Pulmonary HTN:  Holding iloprost and sildenafil while in the ICU.
   .
   # OSA:  [**Month (only) 47**] require intubation later today for hypercapnia.
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now except meds, No IVF, replete 'lytes prn
   # PPX: pneumoboots, PO PPI, bowel regimen
   # Access: 2 PIV
   # Code: FULL
   # Dispo: Monitor in the ICU for now

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 41M ESLD (HCV, EtOH), PHTN, recurrent
   encephalopathy p/w same.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.3 BP 127/77 HR 86 RR 10 with sat 99 on 2L NC.
   Anisocoria (chronic). [**Month (only) **] BS B bases. Distended, +BS. 1+ edema. Labs
   notable for WBC 7K, HCT 24, K+ 4.2, Cr 0.8, ammonia >500. CXR with
   small volumes.
   Agree with plan to treat encephalopathy with lactulose, acidophillus,
   rifaximin and provigil. Will add erythromycin for motility. Continue
   d/w liver team re other therapies and overall plan of care. Anemia is
   stable, will follow [**Hospital1 7**]. Will hold off on intubation, but needs close
   monitoring and frequent ABGs for borderline respiratory function.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill
   Total time: 40 min
