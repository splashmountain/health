Chief Complaint: None
   24 Hour Events:
   - Cultures reveal MSSA bacteremia. Changed from Vanco to Nafcillin.
   Surveillance cultures remain NGTd x 2 days
   - Dofetelide dose unchanged because of changing Cr. [**Month (only) 8**] need increased
   dose if Cr remains stable or improved.
   - I/o Goal even to positive 500 cc
   - Reversed Code status for procedure
   - Back pain/anxiety responded midazolam 0.5 x1
   - Remains Hyponatremic so meds changed to NS instead of D5w. Urine
   sodium less than 10 and Osm 634 indicating hyponatremia from low intake
   vs insensible losses.
   - 2 pm lytes - Na trending up at 127. Cr improved to 1.1 from 1.3.
   - Aortic Valvuloplasy performed with change in peak valve gradient of
   roughly 20 mmHg, BMS x2 placed in RCA. Loaded with plavix 300 mg x1.
   - Noted to be in Afib but rate controlled post-procedure
   - Sheath time [**3371**]. Post cath check 0200 unremarkable. Heparin
   post-procedure started at 2 am along with plavix 300 mg x1. Scant
   bleeding noted at cath site. Bruising marked to eval for interval
   change.

   Assessment and Plan
   79M w/ hx of critical AS (valve area 0.5cm2), sCHF (EF 40), alcoholic
   cirrhosis, DM, recently admitted w/ sCHF exacerbation and worsening of
   AS, who no p/w persistent severe DOE due to critical AS now awaiting
   valvuloplasty, course complicated by sepsis.
   # Sepsis: Bacteria identified as MSSA. Surveillance x 1negative.. No
   peripheral manifestations of endocarditis, and TTE negative for
   vegetations. No obvious sources for staph bacteremia. Sensitivities
   pending. C diff negative x1.
   - D/c Vanco and Start Nafcillin.
   - Wean phenylephrine as tolerated now that past septic shock and will
   help reduce afterload in setting of critical as
   - Repeat surveillance cx today
   # Critical AS: AS critical by valve area. Plan to undergo valvuloplasty
   today. CXR looks improved today in regards to cephalization. .
   -  Continue phenylephrine for MAPs greater than 55
   -  daily CXR to assess volume status
   -  Valvuloplasty today
   # New onset A fib: Noted on admission. Cardioversion [**5-26**]. Chads 2 is
   4. Was on heparin gtt on the floor but will d/c now given hct drop..
   Not on anticoagulation  while awaiting procedure. Has been in NSR last
   24 hrs.
   - Continue Dofetelide at reduced dose
   - Plan to hold anticoagulation for procedure today (see above). Will
   readress anticoagulation post-procedure.
   # Hyponatremia: Given exam, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia from being
   NPO. Will give fluid gently as needed (see below)
   # Acute renal failure: Cr improved to 1.3 today from 1.8. Likely
   improving with better hemodynamics in the setting of resolving septic
   shock.. Fena 0.2.
   - Trend Cr. Renally dose meds
   - goal 500 cc + today
   # Cirrhosis/G positive stools: - Likely [**2-21**] EtOH use. Pt reports that
   he stopped drinking approx 1 year ago.documented on MRCP as well as CT
   abdomen. Pt hepatitis panel negative for Hep A,B,C. Hct stable since
   admission to CCU.
   -2 pivs
   -active T and S
   -continue PPI
   # ?Aspiration: [**Name8 (MD) **] RN and patient report, patient coughs with thin
   liquids. Will defer swallow eval while NPO.
   - S and S consult tomorrow once NPO order reversed
   # Anxiety/Pain: Will attempt low dose benzo post procedure once stroke
   risk assessed
   # DM
 ISS
   # FEN
 NPO while awaiting
   # Access: Right Cordis with IJ. Was placed while bacteremic so will
   need to be replaced.
   # PPx
 No heparin given ? GIB.
   # Code- DNR/I
