Chief Complaint:  CHIEF COMPLAINT: Dyspnea
   REASON FOR MICU ADMISSION: Closer monitoring.
   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6014**] is a 76 y.o. M s/p CABG on [**3133-4-11**] complicated
   post-operatively with pulmonary edema, intubation and mechanical
   ventilation, recently discharged to [**Hospital1 1267**] on [**5-16**], presents for
   dyspnea.  He was noted to have experienced respiratory distress at
   0900, audible bilateral wheezes and increased work of breathing with
   retractions. He was given albuterol nebs, lasix 60 mg IV x 1,
   solumedrol 60 mg IV x 1, and placed on 10L bipap at [**Hospital1 1267**].  CXR and EKG
   completed and he was placed on tele.  CE and BNP were collected and ABG
   completed at [**Hospital1 1267**].  He was unable to take his meds po and was
   lethargic but arousable.  CK 322, trop I <0.05, BNP 4374. ABG at 7 AM
   at [**Hospital1 1267**] 7.4/45/93/30 --> ABG at 10:42 AM at [**Hospital1 1267**] 7.45/46/82/31. CXR
   CHF with possible superimposed PNA in RUL. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**]
   for evaluation.
   .
   Per son, the patient has had constant audible wheezing since he was
   extubated on [**4-27**] after his CABG.  He states that his father also had
   some wheezing prior to admission.  Patient himself states he has
   chronic cough but non productive. Denies fever, chest pain,
   nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea.
   .
   In the ED, intial VS: T (not recorded) HR 70  BP 108/70  RR 28  O2 98%
   on NRB.  Labs drawn significant for hyperkalemia 5.2, Cr 2.0, Bicarb
   34, INR 3.6, and BNP 6521.  EKG and portable CXR performed.  Blood
   cultures x 2 drawn.  Patient's ABG 7.47 / 51 / 114 / 38. Lactate 1.1
   Given continuous nebulizer, methylprednisolone 60 mg x 1, ASA 600 mg PR
   x 1, Levofloxacin 750 mg IV x 1, and ceftriaxone 1 gm IV x 1. Never
   needed bipap. Admitted for closer monitoring.

   Imaging: [**5-23**] PORTABLE CXR: Final Read:
   1. Recomended PA and lateral chest radiograph when condition permits
   for further evaluation of increased retrocardiac opacity which may
   represent atelectasis or pneumonia.
   2. Mild pulmonary edema or cardiomegaly are similar to [**3133-5-11**].
   Microbiology: [**5-23**] Blood Cultures x 2: pending
   ECG: [**5-23**] EKG: atrial fibrillation at ~75 bpm, nl axis, no Q waves, no
   ST changes or TWIs.  No change from prior at [**Hospital1 1267**]
   Assessment and Plan
   76 y.o. M s/p CABG complicated post-operatively with pulmonary edema,
   intubation and mechanical ventilation, recently discharged to [**Hospital1 1267**] on
   [**5-16**], presents for dyspnea.
   .
   # Dyspnea: Per report, pt had acute respiratory distress at [**Hospital1 1267**] and
   was placed on BiPAP. No need for BiPAP in ED and O2 sat 100% on 6 L NC.
   Wheezing throughout lungs so also may be in COPD flare with pCO2
   slightly elevated
   - repeat ABG on floor; if pCO2 elevated or AMS, would do bipap
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebs standing
   - solumedrol 125 mg q8 hours
   - monitor O2 sats with goal 88-93%
   - hold lasix as CXR not grossly volume overloaded and in ARF
   - will hold on further abx as pt not febrile, no leukocytosis and no
   overt infiltrate on CXR which appears improved from previous
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline appears 1.5.  Now 2.0 but does not look
   overtly volume depleted.
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - send urine lytes, eosinophils, UA and culture
   - renally dose all medications
   - consider renal ultrasound
   - change bactrim DS [**Hospital1 **] for UTI to cefepime given renal toxicity
   - hold lasix
   - 250 cc bolus now
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG: post-operative course complicated by flash pulmomary
   edema
   - continue BB with hold parameters, statin, ASA
   - not on ACE-I given renal dysfunction
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: on coumadin but supratherapeutic on
   presentation.  Goal per recent d/c summary 2-2.5.
   - hold coumadin
   - trend INR
   - continue digoxin
   .
   # COPD:
   - continue nebs as above
   - goal O2 88-93%
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: getting supplementation at at [**Hospital1 1267**]. No EKG changes
   - repeat K in AM
   .
   # OSA:
   - CPAP AutoSet 7-15cm H20
