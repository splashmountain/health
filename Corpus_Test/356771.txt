   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER)
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypotension/MS changes:Ipt
s mental status has greatly improved
   following the d/c of Ativan. Pt is alert and able to communicate with
   hand signals on how she is feeling. Pt had episode of MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7214**]
   2 days ago morning associated with hypotension.  Does not appear to be
   septic physiology without fevers or positive culture data.  Responded
   to fluid boluses.  Head CT showed no acute intracranial pathology.
   - continue to monitor mental status
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**1-9**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2755-1-15**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**1-22**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2840-1-25**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem
   - optimizing cardiac status with betablocker and CCB
   - Will aim for even I/Os today
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**1-24**]
   - Will trial trachea mask today
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  No vomiting in >48 hours.  Hct was stable
   at 30.9.  GI c/s obtained who agreeded that bleeding was not an acute
   issue and emergent scope not indicated inless GIB worsened.    IP
   offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we want this (however
   this would not examine the entire abdomen and they don't think the
   blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her getting a scope
   if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Her platlets continued to decrease to a level of
   48 from 57 (have been as low as 61 previously during this
   hospitalization and most recently as high as 122 after a plt
   transfusion.  Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as far back
   at [**2837**], discussed with pt
s son who is the healthcare proxy regarding
   the possibility of a bone marrow biopsy which he agreed to. UPEP, SPEP,
   MMA, peripheral smear currently pending.
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - UPEP, SPEP, MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - Guaiac all stools
   - HIT antibody x 1 negative, other study is pending
   # Hypertension: Hypertensive as high as 205 overnight, responded well
   to IV hydralizine.  SBP
s this morning in 140
   - Continue carvedilol and diltiazem as her BP tolerates with higher
   holding parameters.
   - carvedilol currently at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], will consider increasing to 25mg
   [**Hospital1 **] if she continues to be hypertensive
   - Close monitoring as weaning sedation and pain medication
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol
   - Consider restarting coumadin once pt has undergone bone marrow biopsy
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Restarted carvedilol
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2833**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN.
