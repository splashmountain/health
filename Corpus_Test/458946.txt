   24 Hour Events:
 CARDIOVERSION/DEFIBRILLATION - At [**3186-12-18**] 03:30 PM
   Pt into VTand overdrive pacing did not break it. He was internally
   shocked and remained in VT. He was then externally cardioverted with
   200J into Paced rhythm.
 CARDIOVERSION/DEFIBRILLATION - At [**3186-12-18**] 03:40 PM
   Pt into VTand rate was too slow to pace out of. He was unconscious. He
   was then externally cardioverted with 200J into Paced rhythm.
   Overnight he went into VT at 10:15 and persisted.  Magnet was put on
   pacer.  He ATPed out of VT multiple times despite magnet.   At 1am
   device again paced him out of VT despite sustained hypotension.   ICD
   was finally stopped by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1056**].  He remained in VT most of the
   night, conscious and conversant.  BP remained with MAP > 50.  Continued
   to flip in and out of NSR.  Some talk in family regarding discharge
   home, aware of poor prognosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yom with h/o VT p/w VT storm, s/p arctic sun protocol.  Now with
   nearly full neurologic recovery.  However remains in persistent VT.
    VT Storm - Currently in and out of VT for hours.  Slow VT with
   perfusable pressures, likely [**2-3**] to amio load.
   - On amio only per pt
s wishes, pt aware that unlikely to help.
   - d/c tele monitor in room
   - morphine for pain
   - treat discomfort
   - pt [**Name (NI) 566**]
   Hypotension - a component of his VT
   - no pressors
   Comfort
 d/c lines
   Pump - EF < 20%, volume 1L positive.  Will not diurese additionally
   given poor prognosis.
   FEN - regular diet
   PPX - not needed
