   Assessment and Plan
   74yo F with hx of COPD, cellulitis, depression, medical non-compliance
   who presents with hypoxia/hypercarbia and LE cellulitis.
   .
   #. Respiratory failure: Likely represents worsening COPD in the setting
   of medical non-compliance and continued smoking.  Chest CT concerning
   for small PNA.  CTA negative for PE.  Echo does not suggest heart
   failure.  Likely high PCO2 at baseline (70-75% given HCO3).

   - Unasyn for a total of 14 days.
   - Flu nasal swab pending
   .
   # Cellulitis: Worsening over past several months.  Likely chronic
   changes and infection.  Blood cultures thus far negative.
   - Abx as above Unasyn for a total of 14 days.
   - Wound care consult and redressings.
   - F/u cultures
   .
   #. Medical Non-compliance:
   - SW consult over hospital course
 once extubated!
