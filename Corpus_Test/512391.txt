   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old man with history of DM, hypertension, status post CABG
   complicated by CVA and subglottic stenosis (after multiple
   intubations), CHF with the EF of 35%-40%, who presented to the ED with
   shortness of breath & stridor and was found to have a fluid collection
   in anterior neck s/p tracheal dilation two days prior as well as
   possible multi-focal PNA.
   # Airway compromise/Anterior Neck Collection: H/o subglottic stenosis
   s/p multiple intubations.  Has h/o stridor.  Underwent tracheal
   dilation at Mass Eye & Ear on [**9-12**] w/ Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3004**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4246**].  Suspect acute
   compromise in airway is related to procedure; however, no clear
   findings on fiberoptic imaging while intubating.  Per ENT, pt's sridor
   could be rebound subglottic swelling from recent procedure, however
   this usually doesn't happen in this time frame.  Anterior neck
   collection may be related to airway compromise given its size.  Again,
   suspect that this collection is related to recent procedure.  [**Month (only) 56**] be
   early infectious collection vs. edema.  Not drainable at present.
   - Continue empiric treatment with clindamycin as well as vanc and Zosyn
   - brief course of increased steroids to attempt to decrease extent of
   neck swelling
   - keep intubated for now; will d/w ENT & anesthesia to coordinate
   possible extubation today/tomorrow
   - Monitor neck for increasing size of mass
   - ENT following
   # Fevers: Low grade temps overnight.  Ddx includes infected neck fluid
   collection (though does not appear infected on CT scan) versus PNA seen
   on CT. WBC rising.  Pt not currently showing signs of sepsis.
   - Con
t expanded antibiotic coverage as above
   - culture today
   - mini BAL
   # Drop in HCT: pt
s Hct was 42 on admission (baseline high 30s), then
   dropped to 27 after getting IVF.  Also, question of blood being drawn
   proximal to IV being run, possibly causing significant hemodilution.
   No e/o gross hemorrhage at present, although pt could have blood in ant
   neck collection.  Hct now stable
   -          Trend HCT, appears stable
   -          Guaiac stools
   # CAD: s/p 5 vessel CABG.  CE negative x2 since presentation.  No CP.
   - Restarted coreg, aspirin, will resume statin as well since pt has OGT
   # CHF/Cardiomyopathy: last TTE in [**8-9**] w/ EF 35-40%.
   - restart lasix
   - Con
t Coreg; restart lisinopril; hold spironolactone for today
   #Afib/CVA: in sinus at present. Rate 70s. INR 1.4.  Coumadin had been
   on hold peri-procedure (trach dilation).
   - holding Coumadin for possible procedure
   - on decreased dose of Coreg
   # H/o postoperative polymorphic VT: tx
d mexiletine
   - hold mexiletine  for now
   #DM II: RISS plus lantus (will increase lantus dose to home dose of 32u
   QHS)
