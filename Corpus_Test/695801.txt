   Imaging: CXR--Right middle lobe consolidation

   consolidation confirmed.  We have small areas of basilar opacities as
   well.
   Microbiology: BC--Pending
   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo male with history of CAD, Hepatitis and now admitted with 3 day
   prodrome of cough and blood tinged sputum now diagnosed with
   pneumonia.  He has clear evidence of multilobar pneumonia and now with
   persistent hemoptysis
   1)Pneumonia-Right middle lobe opacity seen and [**Hospital1 **]-basilar opacities are
   present as well.  With hemoptysis does expand the differential as well.
   -Continue with Unasyn/Levoflox
   -Will follow sputum GS C+S
   -Will wean O2 as tolerated
   -Will need follow up to resolution of symptoms and signs for active
   pneumonia
in addition, will need to confirm resolution of infiltrate
   -Reaonable for pulmonary consultation service to follow
   -He has known PPD negative at this time
apices are clear at this
   time
and that makes reactivation TB unlikely but we are left
   -BAC is of concern but patient with normal CXR 6 months prior
   2) CHEST PAIN-No evidence of active myocardial ischemia and patient
   does state that chest pain is resolved at this time and was strongly
   associated with cough and pain.  We see no evidence of pleural effusion
   at this time.
   -Follow exam
