   Assessment and Plan
   75 F with COPD, htn, bilateral hip replacement now with NSTEMI, CHF and
   COPD flare, complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure, now
   resolved with asystolic event likely [**12-31**] increased vagal tone plus amio
   and beta blockers now s/p PPM placement [**2864-2-26**].
   #s/p Vagal episode: Likely has sinus node dysfunction.   The patient
   also had been started on amio and beta blockers to control heart rate,
   may have contributed to episode.  Consulted EP yesterday.   No further
   vagal episodes.
   - PPM placed yesterday. f/u cxr this am for placement of leads. [**Month/Day/Year **]
   antibiotics X 3 days
   - F/U EP in 1 week.
   - Restart beta blocker (carvedilol). Defer to EP to restart amio or
   not.
   - Held coumadin in prep for PPM placement -  will restart it today.
   Rehab to check INR in a few days
   #Afib/flutter with RVR: Sinus now, no arrhythmias overnight.
   - restart carvedilol and possibly amio pending EP recs.
   - F/U EP in 1 week
   - coumadin today. INR check in next few days at rehab
   - decrease asa to 81mg in one month per cardiology recs as o/p
   #NSTEMI: s/p LAD [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 4

   Looks overall euvolemic, although still with mild crackles on pulm
   exam. Given lasix 20mg IV lasix QD
   - [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **]
   - resumed lasix 20mg PO daily in am to maintain I/O even to 500ml
   negative as required IV lasix yesterday after having it held in setting
   of hypotension
   #COPD: Hyperinflated lungs with hypercarbia consistent with COPD. Being
   treated for exacerbation. Sputum with only sparse yeast/mold.
   - Completed course of levoflox x 5 days
   - Quick steroid taper completed
   - Cont home inhalers, advair and spiriva
