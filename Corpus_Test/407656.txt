Chief Complaint: Respiratory failure, endocarditis
   24 Hour Events:
   [**6-27**]
   - Persistent leukocytosis -> C. diff positive.  No growth on blood
   cultures; persistent urine cx + for yeast but no benefit to treating
   asymptomatic funguria per ID attg curbside.  Started PO vanc,
   - CT [**Doctor First Name 438**]: HIT positive is absolute contraindication for bypass, but
   even if not HIT positive, she is not a surgical candidate [**2-7**] to
   ongoing infection, CRI, need for AVR/MVR, and embolic strokes.
   - Fam mtg: Family made aware of CT [**Doctor First Name 438**] recs and would like her to go
   to rehab with possible transition to hospice care.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   75F with h/o severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to OSH with
   pneumonia, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, ARF, transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty
   for critical AS and found to have mitral valve endocarditis.
   # Embolic CVA: Likely [**2-7**] endocarditis  (less likely embolic or
   thrombotic).  MRI head revealed
multiple bilateral acute infarcts in
   the supra- and intra-tentorial region
, likely embolic given widespread
   distribution.
   - No intervention on valve per CT [**Doctor First Name 438**]
   - Continue PCN course
   # Mitral Valve Endocarditis: Blood cultures positive on day 2 of
   hospital stay at [**Hospital1 **] with pansensitive S. salivarius. TTE shows
   posterior MV leaflet endocarditis. Non-contrast CT of head/neck without
   obvious dental abscess.  Now with embolic CVA.  All bacterial and
   fungal blood cultures at this hospital without growth to date.
   - Continue PCN for Strep salivarius (6 week course started on [**6-7**]) per
   ID recs
   - Stop daily ECGs (normal PR interval for >10 days)
   - F/u blood cx
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope.  Up 3 L for
   length-of-stay.
   - Low-dose Lasix gtt with I/O goal net even-to-minus 500 cc today.
   - No role for valvuloplasty at this time until acute vegetation
   resolved
   # Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   severe COPD, atelectasis, hemorrhage, edema and HAP s/p full course of
   vanc/zosyn.  Has tolerated PS for 24 hours.
   - Lasix gtt at 1.0-1.5 for I/O goal as above
   - Decrease free water flushes to minimize intake.
   - Continue PS today; will monitor via VBG and O2 sats
   - F/u pending cx
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation (today is day [**3-8**] at
   20mg), decrease to 10mg tomorrow
   - Fentanyl patch 50 mcg/72hr, Valium at 5 mg PO q12hr
   # C diff positive: Started vanc [**3453-6-27**]
   - Clarify course (? continue course to end 7 days after Pen G ([**3459-7-26**])
   )
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets decreasing again (101 -> 72 over 48 hours
   after) initial increase once heparin held; HIT Ab positive.  Likely
   also [**2-7**] underlying liver disease and reactive component from
   infection.
   - F/u serotonin release assay
   # Anemia: Hct had slowly trended down but bumped appropriately after 2
   u pRBC [**6-25**].  Possible sources include continued bloody secretions,
   guaiaic positive stools, hemolysis from valve vegetation.  Hct stable
   today.
   - Trend hcts daily
   # ARF: No known h/o renal dysfunction. Cr 1.2 at OSH now stable at
   around 2 daily. Abd U/S here did not report hydronephrosis but did have
   urothelial thickening suggesting chronic UTI (?fungal) with Ucx
   persistently growing yeast despite foley changes. U/S also suggestive
   of chronic renal dysfunction. Urine negative for eos.
   - Per ID, tx of chronic funguria is ineffective
   - MR abd not indicated per radiology
   - Will rediscuss after goals of care discussion with family
   # Elevated LFTs: H/o autoimmune hepatitis with baseline LFTs unknown.
   Bili and alk phos elevated yesterday, slightly improved today.
   ?Increase hemolysis due to endocarditis vs. biliary pathology. [**Month (only) 56**] be
   due to gallbladder sludge; no signs of cholecystitis or cholelithiasis.
   Subtle liver nodularity with nl hepatic flow.
