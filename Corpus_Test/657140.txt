   Imaging: 1. Large hiatal hernia containing nearly the entire stomach,
   without evidence
   of obstruction. There is adjacent atelectasis in bilateral lungs;
   infection
   within these regions would be difficult to exclude.
   2. Cannot assess for pulmonary embolism as no IV contrast was
   administered.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 y.o. F s/p L total knee replacement on [**3403-10-26**], presents with
   increasing shortness of breath, fever, productive cough.
   # Dyspnea: Differential diagnosis includes HAP given fever, productive
   cough (likely); pulmonary embolism given recent L TKR and likely
   immobility; congestive heart failure exacerbation although does not
   appear overloaded; ischemic event.. LENIs negative.
   - treating for hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization: vancomycin / cefepime
   - sputum culture no growth; legionalla negative
   - NC, sats titrate to >91-92%
   - S+S consult today to address hoarseness
   .
   # Fever: No reported fevers at NH, but febrile in ED
   - treating empirically for HAP, though culture data remains negative.
   # CHF, diastolic: Appear euvolemic
   -restart Furosemide 120 mg po daily at 6 AM, Furosemide 80 mg po daily
   at 2 PM)
   -consider echo today
   - continue isosorbide dinitrate
   # HTN: continue nifedipine ER with holding parameters, hold cardiazem
   and restart in AM.
   # Hyperlipidemia: continue simvastatin
   # Gout: continue allopurinol, renally dosed
   # Hiatal Hernia: Supposedly old from 5 years ago, but may have some
   contribution to worsening dyspnea given stomach in chest.
   - appreciate general surgery recs
   # s/p L TKR: recently hospitalized for surgery
   - pain control with IV morphine
   - Lovenox per ortho discharge
   # UTI: + UA, was on levofloxacin at NH
   - abx treated as above will cover UTI
   - f/u urine culture
   # Hyponatremia: appears euvolemic, may be due to lung process vs. pain
   - f/u urine osm
   - will not give IVFs overnight
   - monitor sodium
   - treat pneumonia and pain
   # CKD: improving eGFR
   # Anemia: Unknown baseline.
   - guaiac all stools
   - active T&S
   - iron studies, retic count
   # Chronic Pain: continue neurontin (renally dosed)
   # FEN: hold IVFs / replete lytes prn / NPO except meds
   # PPX: home PPI, lovenox, bowel regimen
   # ACCESS: PIV #18 and #22
