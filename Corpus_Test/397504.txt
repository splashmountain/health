   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with RA previously on IS medication, CAD, HTN, PVD, admitted
   [**2939-4-20**] for necrotizing faciitis of LLE, s/p BKA/AKA, mucositis, now
   with neutropenia secondary to methotrexate, fevers/rigors, and altered
   mental status.
   1. Neutropenic Fever (No longer neutropenic):
   Febrile in the last 24 hrs but no longer neutropenic. She was
   previously treated for MSSA and GAS necrotizing fasciitis. Since then,
   she became neutropenic and febrile, initially responsive to vancomycin,
   cefepime, and fluconazole. Since then however, she has had a new fever.
   She was transitioned to daptomycin, meropenem, and fluconazole with
   still persistent fevers. Etiology still includes infection related to
   central line, urinary tract infection, and decubitus ulcer. Pulmonary
   source appears less likely given unremarkable CT chest and no
   clinically apparent pulmonary symptoms. GI source also appears less
   likely given unremarkable GI symptoms and CT Abd. Additional
   non-infectious sources of her infection include drug fever, malignancy,
   or rheumatologic disease. Drug fever is possible, although all
   antibiotics have recently been changed. Regarding malignancy, her CT
   abd/pelvis did note ovarian cyst and bulky uterus, both of which are
   unexpected in a patient of this age. Regarding rheumatologic disease,
   she does have a history of significant RA and she is now off
   methotrexate, although this seems less likely given no findings of new
   rash or joint inflammation
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - continue daptomycin, meropenem, fluconazole, and flagyl for broad
   spectrum coverage
   - follow-up blood, urine, and stool cultures
   - will aim to place IR-guided PICC line on Tuesday; if patient becomes
   hemodynamically unstable prior to then, would consider replacing
   central line
   - follow-up final read of CXR
   - consider pelvic US to evaluate uterus and ovarian cyst
   - follow-up with rheumatology regarding possible rheumatologic
   etiology  of her symptoms
   - continue supportive care with acetaminophen and meperidine for rigors
   2. Pancytopenia:
   Patient became pancytopenic on [**2939-5-29**], most likely related to bone
   marrow suppression in the setting of methotrexate. EBV and CMV studies
   are negative, and parvovirus is pending. Patient was started on
   leucovorin rescue with mild improvement in her WBC, although her ANC
   remains quite low.
   - Trend daily CBC with ANC
   - Active T/S, xfuse for Hct<21, Plt<10K
   - Hold methotrexate
   - Cont leucovorin rescue at 7.5mg IV q6 until methotrexate <0.01
   - Check daily methotrexate levels
   - f/u parvo B19
   - Cont supportive care
   - Appreciate Heme/onc recs
   3. Abdominal Pain:
   Patient appears to be in abdominal discomfort, although etiology is
   unclear. CT Abd/Pelvis was unremarkable, although she may not mount an
   inflammatory response due to her marked neutropenia.
   - Suportive care, pain control
   - consider pelvic US
   - Empiric flagyl/meropenem/dapto as above
   4. Delirium:
   Etiology of her delirium remains unclear. Differential includes
   infection with unclear source, ICU delirium. Additional possibilities
   include further clot burden or stroke.
   - consider MRI/MRA to evaluate for embolic or thrombotic events
   - Supportive care
   - Treat underlying fever/infection
   - Replete lytes, monitor renal function
   - Low dose haldol prn
   5.Mucositis and esophagitis:
   Etiology is most likely related to methotrexate toxicity and candidal
   infection. Her symptoms appear improved since transfer.
   - Cont mouth wash for comfort
   - Cont Fluconazole at increased dose x14 days (d1 = [**5-29**])
   - TPN
   - Cont leucovorin
   - magic mouthwash prn
   6. Pulmonary embolism and DVT
   Patient was found incidentally to have a pulmonary embolism on CT Torso
   and follow-up bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds noted extensive
   clot burden bilaterally. Differential diagnosis includes DVT in the
   setting of prolonged hospitalization and immobility, although
   malignancy is also a concern.
   - consider pelvic US for malignancy evaluation
   - continue conservative heparin gtt
   7. Coagulopathy
   Etiology of her coagulopathy is unclear. Despite very conservative
   heparin sliding scale, patient is supratherapeutic and has had elevated
   INRs previously.
   - check DIC labs
   - continue vitamin K repletion
   8.  Tachycardia:
   Likely multifactorial to include infection, pain, volume depletion.  PE
   to be considered though not in any respiratory distress.  Other more
   common reasons
   - Treat underlying causes
   - Cont antibiotics, IVF, pain control
   9. Rheumatoid Arthritis:
   Rheumatology following previously.  No acute issues at this time.  Cont
   to hold methotrexate and cont leukovorin rescue.  Cont maintenance
   steroids
   10. s/p AKA: Stable currently.  No obvious infection.  Cont to monitor
   with proper wound care.
