   Assessment and Plan
   75yoM CAD, CHF, PVD, s/p resp failure with trach/PEG with vent assoc
   ESBL Klebsiella and Acineotbacter pna on [**Last Name (un) **]/Cefepime, VRE
   bacteremia/sepsis on daptomycin, and LUE/RLE DVT on enox. Requires
   nightly vent assistance for anxiety/tachypnea/diaphoresis.
   > Respiratory failure - Pna (ESBL klebsiella and acinetobacter),
   worsening b/l pleural effusions that have reaccumlated following
   thoracentesis, and significant of abdominal distention.   Not treating
   MDR acinetobacter or stenotrophomonas. Effusion was tapped for 1.2 L on
   [**10-25**] and was transudative. He is also complicated by profound volume
   overload and weakness (exacerbated by over all deconditioning,
   prolonged MICU stay and courses of steroids).  Of note, patient has
   been having very bloody secretions since [**10-26**]
 bronch deferred given
   stable from a respiratory standpoint and likely scope/suctioning trauma
   given anticoagulation.  Now requiring ventilator support, likely due to
   increased volume, capillary leak from low level sepsis and possible
   aspiration given cuff leak.  A new PNA as source of VRE is possible as
   well.
   -          Trach collar mask and intermittent vent support as needed.
   -          CXR
   -          Completed 14 day course of Cefepime/[**Last Name (un) **] today
   -          Diuresis as tolerated
    > Bacteremia/Sepsis: VRE growing out of blood from [**10-27**] that may
   explain fever/hypotension from [**10-26**].  Now afebrile for a few days with
   stable CXR. Will need to f/u sputum, blood and urine clx and add
   daptomycin for now.  Unclear source as PICC line is new on 25^th and no
   evidence of UTI. [**Month (only) 56**] be from new PNA given progression of CXR over past
   few days.  His skin exam is actually improved since [**10-8**]. The
   thoracentesis on [**10-25**] has been unrevealing in terms of empyema as it
   appears to be most consistent with a transudative effusion with benign
   pH. ID does not feel that patient needs coverage for MDR
   acinetobacter/stenotrophomonas ([**10-24**]) at this time.  Have completed 14
   day course of cefepime/[**Last Name (un) 411**] for VAP based on [**10-15**] cultures.
   -          F/U blood (picc vs peripheral), urine, sputum and c.diff
   -          Continue dapto for VRE
   -          Decrease hydrocortisone 25mg IV
   -          ID said to add colistin if worsens
   > Oliguria/ARF: Likely prerenal, but in the setting of massive
   anasarca.  Now making decent urine.
   -          Check bladder pressure
   -          Gently diurese
   >Hypernatremia: Now slightly worse.
   - Increase FWF.
   >  Ileus.  Patient had ileus since [**10-11**] that has now resolved with NGT
   suctioning, bowel rest, and minimizing opioids.  Tolerating tube feeds
   at goal with reglan for promotility
   -          bowel regimen
   -          ultram only at low dose with turns, caution with opioids,
   cont reglan
    >  Anemia:  H/o UGIB/coffee grounds.  Noted to have coffee grounds in
   NG suctioning on [**10-15**], likely secondary to prolonged NG suctioning.
   Now with decreased hct of unclear source, but having hemoptysis. S/p 1
   unit PRBC with downtrending Hct with another unit today.   Possible
   that he is just oozing from various sources given anticoagulation.
   -          Serial Hcts
   -          Po ppi
   -          hold aspirin, plavix; consider resuming aspirin in future if
   hct/ bleed remains stable
   -          Transfuse for Hct goal >25
   -
   > LUE/RLE DVT.  Anticoagulation with heparin started on [**10-20**].
   Transitioned to lovenox on [**10-21**].
   -          continue lovenox at low dose, 60mg [**Hospital1 **], based on dry weight
   (concern for bleeding)
   -          [**Month (only) 56**] need to hold if Hct drops significantly
   > A. fib.  Has A. fib with RVR.  HR currently in 100s.  Getting
   anticoagulated.
   -          titrating BB
   -          on Lovenox
   >  PVD - awaiting revascularization after DC.  Stable LLE dry gangrene.
   -          further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from
   this hospitalization.
   -          hold asa/plavix given above, consider resuming aspirin when
   NGT is removed and hct stable
   -          hold opioids due to ileus
   > HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC
 hold on diuresis given hypotension,
   although he is total body vol up.  Found to have elevated BNP.  Also
   with pulmonary edema on bronch from [**10-14**].
   -          Gently diurese
   All other issues per resident note.
