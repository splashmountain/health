   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo M h/o dCHF (EF>55%), AS s/p AVR, AF, pulmonary HTN, CAD s/p CABG,
   3rd-degree heart block s/p ppm, transferred from [**Hospital 11433**] Hospital for
   consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the
   setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.
   .
   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: Currently, the patient
   exhibits symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart failure with
   peripheral edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated JVP.
   Weight is significantly elevated from dry weight. Of note, there has
   been a recent worsening in tricuspid regurgitation that may be
   contributing to the patient's symptoms. Per Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 985**], patient
   may need a degree of peripheral edema in order to have enough preload
   to maintain cardiac output.
   - continue diuresis with torsemide
   - right and left heart cath with trial of vasodilator following
   adequate diuresis
   - continue metoprolol
   - consider starting ACE I again, but would favor diuresis first
   .
   # Altered mental status: Hypercarbia ruled out with ABG. Altered mental
   status could be related to poor forward flow in setting of heart
   failure. However, asterixis suggests a toxic-metabolic cause. This has
   been attributed to uremia in the past, but BUN/Cr do not seen elevated
   enough to explain the patient's encephalopathy.  Other possibilities
   include non-convulsive seizures, infection, and accumulation of
   medications in setting of decreased renal function.
   - avoid sedating medications
   - consult neurology
   - check UA, UCx
   .
   # Recent treatment for presumed PNA: Was on cefepime and linezolid and
   OSH for possible pneumonia but no evidence of fever, leukocytosis, or
   infiltrate.
   - no antibiotics for now
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease: The patient is actually at his recent
   baseline creatinine (1.6-1.9). Urine sediment bland. Likely etiology is
   poor forward flow.
   - optimize hemodynamics
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # COPD: The patient sounds rhonchorous and wheezy on exam.
   - albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - inhaled fluticasone
   .
   # Mediastinal adenopathy: Unclear etiology, could relate to infection
   vs. inflammatory or neoplastic process.  Would be helpful to have
   radiology review images in comparison to priors, as patient has
   multiple prior CTs.
   .
   # s/p mechanical aortic valve: Well-seated on recent echo.
   - hold coumadin for now in anticipation of possible procedure
   - heparin gtt
   .
   # AFib with single-chamber PPM placed for 3rd degree AV block:
   - hold coumadin for now in anticipation of possible procedure.
   .
   # h/o CAD s/p CABG: Not on aspirin, presumably because of concern for
   bleeding while on coumadin. No evidence of ischemia. Cardiac enzymes
   negative at Wincester
   - continue simvastatin
   .
   # DM:  controlled by diet
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # BPH:  continue flomax
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: low sodium, diabetic diet with fluid restriction
   Glycemic Control:  insulin sliding scale

   Medical Decision Making
   Diuresis is in progress with > 800 cc negative past 12 hours.   RHC to
   assess difficulties with diuresis.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time
