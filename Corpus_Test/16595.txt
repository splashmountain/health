Admission Date: [**2954-10-8**]        Discharge Date: [**2955-7-29**]

Date of Birth:  [**2894-6-15**]        Sex:  M

Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]


ADDENDUM:  As previously summarized in earlier discharge
summaries, this patient has had a complex hospital course.
This dictation will summarize the events essentially from the
last discharge summary up until his anticipated discharge on
[**2955-7-29**] or shortly thereafter.

The patient largely had an unremarkable hospital course for
the latter month of his stay. On [**7-3**] and 12, it was
noted that the patient did have multiple episodes of
ventricular bigeminy as well as frequent PVCs that could not
be explained by electrolyte abnormalities or otherwise. The
cardiology and electrophysiology services were consulted and
the electrophysiology service ended up interrogating and
readjusting the patient's AICD in place. Subsequent to this,
the patient had also some adjustments of his antiarrhythmic
and antihypertensive medications into a more stable regimen.
Other than this, the patient had only one significant event
for the remainder of hospital stay. This occurred on
[**2955-7-25**]. On this date, the patient had what in
retrospect turned out to be a hypoglycemic seizure. Further
workup including head CT and EEG remained negative. The
neurology service was consulted and did agree that the
patient had a significant hypoglycemic seizure. They had no
significant recommendations following this. From another
physiologic standpoint, the patient continued to do well and
weaned off of his ventilator dependence slowly but surely. On
the date of this dictation, [**2955-7-29**], the patient
could tolerate approximately 6 hours on tracheostomy mask
collars with no ventilatory support at that time. He had not
as of yet been attempted either overnight or for 24 hour
period without ventilator support. He was tolerating his tube
feeds, however, and had a euvolemic fluid balance that was
auto-maintained. His stoma functioned well and without
difficulty. The patient was free of pain and cognizant of all
the issues going on around him. He and his sister were ready
for transfer to rehab with intermittent ventilator support.
