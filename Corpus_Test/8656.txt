CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Failed graft.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69-year-old gentleman
who underwent a left fem posterior tibial bypass graft with
nonreversed saphenous vein in [**2857-1-5**], who underwent a
graft surveillance on [**2857-5-2**], which demonstrated
significant graft stenosis in the distal segment in the
region of the distal anastomosis. The patient underwent an
arteriogram today with hopes of interventional procedure.
They were not able to intervene. The patient now is admitted
for preoperative hydration and postoperative angio hydration
for revision of his left fem PT bypass.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission include Toprol XL 25 mg daily,
Lasix 40 mg in the a.m. and 20 mg in the p.m., Trental 400 mg
4 times daily, Lantus 36 units at bedtime, Humalog insulin
sliding scale, folate 1 mg daily.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Peripheral vascular disease, status
post left fem PT in [**2857-1-5**], history of carotid artery
stenosis status post right CEA in [**2855-4-6**], history of
coronary artery disease and non Q wave MI in [**2851-11-6**],
status post CABG x5 in [**2851-11-6**], history of systolic
congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 35%
[**2855-2-6**], history of diabetes type 2 insulin-dependent
with neuropathy and retinopathy, history of vitreous
hemorrhage with vitrectomy.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married, lives with his wife.
[**Name (NI) **] has 35 tobacco years of smoking, has not smoked for
greater than 20 years. Occasional alcohol intake.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 97.4, 64, 138/76,
respirations 18, O2 saturation 99% in room air. General
appearance: Alert, white male in no acute distress. Lungs are
clear to auscultation. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm.
Abdominal examination is unremarkable. Right groin is clean,
dry and intact without hematoma. Pulse exam shows palpable
femoral bilaterally. The popliteal is palpable. The DP and PT
are dopplerable signals. On the left, the DP is dopplerable.
There are 3 lateral plantar ulcerations without erythema or
exudate.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent diagnostic
arteriogram. He was without any event and was admitted for
elective surgery. Labs: White count was 8.5, hematocrit 36.6.
INR 1.1. BUN 20, creatinine 1.0. Urinalysis was negative. EKG
was normal sinus rhythm without significant changes from
previous EKG of [**2853-2-5**]. Chest x-ray was unremarkable.
The patient's post-angio labs were without any changes. The
patient underwent on [**5-15**], a patch angioplasty of the
left common femoral DP graft with lesser saphenous vein jump
graft from the left graft to DP distally. The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the PACU
in stable condition. Postoperatively, he remained
hemodynamically stable. Postoperative hematocrit was 32.5.
The patient was placed on a heparin drip for goal PTT of 50
to 60. Heparin dosing was adjusted according to goal PTT from
50 to 60. The patient was transferred to the VICU for
continued monitoring and care from the PACU. Postoperative
day 1, he did require nitroglycerin for systolic hypertension
which was weaned the following day. His hematocrit dropped to
28.7. BUN and creatinine remained stable at 14 and 0.8. PTT
was 56.3 with an adjustment in his heparin with PTT 6 hours
later of 75.4 and repeat PTT was continued and heparin was
adjusted accordingly. The patient had palpable graft pulse at
the calf and a palpable left radial pulse. The patient
remained on bedrest. His fluids were HEP-locked. His
nitroglycerin was weaned and he was continued on his home
medications. He auto-diuresed and did not require Lasix. His
diet was advanced. His Humalog sliding scale was adjusted
secondary to hyperglycemia with improvement in his glycemic
control. Postoperative day 2, blood pressure was under
excellent control with systolic blood pressure 133, diastolic
65. He was afebrile. His heparin was discontinued. His Foley
was discontinued. A line was discontinued. The patient was
allowed up out of bed to the chair. He was to be
nonweightbearing on the left foot secondary to site of
incision. Ace wrap should be worn when ambulating from foot
to knee on the left. Postoperative day 3, it was noted the
patient had a troponin spike from 0.04 to 0.17. The patient
denied any symptoms, was hemodynamically stable. An EKG was
obtained and enzymes were continued to be cycled. The patient
was allowed to ambulate. Decision regarding discharge will be
made after evaluation of the elevated enzymes at that time.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient may ambulate essential
distances. He should wear an ace wrap from foot to knee on
the left when ambulating. He should keep the left leg
elevated when sitting in a chair. He may shower but no tub
baths. He should call Dr.[**Name (NI) 1376**] office if he develops a
fever greater than 101.5. if the leg wounds become red,
swollen or drain. He should not drive until seen in follow-
up. He should continue taking his stool softener while taking
pain medications to prevent constipation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Folic acid 1 mg daily.
2.  Trental 400 mg 3 times daily.
3.  Protonix 40 mg daily.
4.  Colace 100 mg twice a day.
5.  Acetaminophen 500 mg tablets, 2 q.4-6 hours p.r.n. for
    pain.
6.  Hydromorphone 2 mg tablet, 1 q-2 hours p.r.n. for pain.
7.  Aspirin 325 mg daily.

Clinic.

    fraction 35%.
6.  History of type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin dependent,
    with neuropathy and retinopathy.
7.  History of vitreous hemorrhage, status post vitrectomy.

MAJOR SURGICAL PROCEDURES:
