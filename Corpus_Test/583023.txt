   Assessment and Plan
   86yo F with h/o AF on coumadin and [**Hospital 4727**] transferred to the CCU for
   tachy-brady syndrome and need for likely pacemaker placement.
   .
   1. Rhythm:
   Patient has likely tachy-brady syndrome, with plan to get pacemaker due
   to symptomatic sinus arrest. Since holding beta blocker and
   propafenone, HR improved to 50s-60s with less frequent and shorter
   duration (<=2.25sec) pauses on tele.
   - PPM today
   - F/u EP recs re: post-procedure antiarrhythmics. Likely will start
   amiodarone.
   - Until procedure, keep pacer pads on, and administer atropine for any
   further symptomatic bradycardia (has not been needed thus far).
   .
   2. Anemia: Hct down 5 pts this am, although still c/w baseline of high
   20s to low 30s. No clear source of blood loss, vitals stable.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Hemolysis labs normal
   - PM hct
   .
   3. Coronary Artery Disease:
   Nonobstructive CAD on cardiac cath at OSH in [**2639**].
   - Determine why pt not on 81mg ASA daily, and consider starting if no
   contraindication.
   .
   4. Pump:
   TTE in [**5-1**] was notable for MR only. Appears euvolemic or slightly
   hypovolemic on exam.
   - I/O goal even to 500ml positive, less if develops resp symptoms.
   .
   5. Entero-cutaneous fistula:
   - Continue wound care as she does at home and monitor
