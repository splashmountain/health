   Assessment and Plan
   78 F with MMP including dHF, OSA, s/p trach, HTN, DM, atrial
   fibrillation on warfarin, history of LGIB [**2-6**] diverticulosis in [**2908**]
   presents with rectal bleeding.
   .
   # BRBPR - likely etiology is diverticulosis given similar presentation
   in [**2908**] where colonoscopy showed diverticulosis. No evidence of UGI
   source given overall stability and negative NGL.  Patient was
   hypotensive but has responded well to IVFthough now on dopamine
   overnight. Patient initially went emergently to angio but no bleed was
   identified. Yesterday, she received a colonoscopy which showed old
   blood, multiple diverticuli but no clear source of bleed. Not a good
   surgical candidate if rebleeds.  Remains with stable HCT x24hrs
   post-bleed.
   - active type and screen
   - 2 large bore PIV and midline in place
   - cont to hold warfarin, s/p reversal with FFP, vitamin K, profilnine.
   - transfuse PRBC as needed.
   - Q12H HCT
   - GI, IR following.
   - Surgery recs not an operative candidate
   - if rebleeds, would try to get tagged red-cell scan and repeat angio.
   Patient is not a good surgery candidate.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with hypotension that persists despite adequate
   fluid recuscitation.  Remains on dopamine at low dose.  Does not appear
   to have septic shock, unclear etiology of persistent hypotension.
   - cont dopamine for now, wean as tolerated
   - echo today
   - will hold off diuresis now.
   - will check random cortisol
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Multifactorial respiratory failure with OSA,
   CHF, also ?reactive component on multiple nebs. Now CXR overnight
   appears much worse with left-sided white-out, possibly collapse, also
   concerning for perforated esophagus. CT chest without e/o esophageal
   perforation, LLL atelectasis vs collapse but L lung expanded, sm pl
   effusion, large heart, contrast from angio noted in kidney, radiology
   recs rad definition of ATN.  CT chest not c/w CXR done earlier AM.  CXR
   this AM with improved L lung field
   - daily CXR
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers.
   - Volume status as above.
   - CT chest without suggestion of consolidation, does not appear to have
   PNA.
   - d/c vanco at this point.
   - cont PEEP to 10 to maintain patent airways
   - will wean vent today to PS [**10-14**] at 40%FiO2.
   .
   # Bradycardia/NSTEMI.  Troponin bump to 0.13 with normal CK.  Likely
   demand in setting of large GI losses. Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   Now on dopamine due to hypotension and bradycardia. Concerning these
   symptoms could be related to new lung process
   - discuss with cards.
   - Adequate transfusion resuscitation.
   - Hold on ASA, plavix, heparin given magnitude of bleed.
   - await ECHO
   .
   # Chronic dHF- last TTE shows grade I diastolic dysfxn and EF 50-55%
   - hold lasix, lisinopril given concern for hypotension.
   - monitor fluid balance once losses stabilize.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation.
   - hold warfarin.
   - hold diltiazem
   .
   # UTI.  Continuous hospital exposures with risk for resistent
   organisms.
   - Zosyn for now and followup cultures.
   .
   # Diabetes- seems like this is diet controlled, no diabetes medications
   on past d/c summaries, [**12-12**] HgbA1c 6.1%
   - sliding scale insulin
   .
   # CKD- stage III, baseline 1.5. Currently 1.2
   - holding lisinopril and antihypertensives.
   - per radiology, CT chest with e/o possible ATN due to decreased
   clearance of contrast dye
   - avoid overdiuresis in next few days given angio and contrast exposure
   overnight.
   .
   FEN:  NPO for now.  Will consult nutrition for TF recs.  NPO today.
   Prophylaxis:  Pneumoboots, PPI, bowel regimen
