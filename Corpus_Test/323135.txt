   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment/Plan: [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with PMHx of DM & hypotensive TIA presents
   from rehab with severe sepsis, (hypotension and UTI/pyelonephritis) and
   abdominal pain.
   # Sepsis/Pyelonephritis: Pt presented with hypotension, acute renal
   failure, bandemia, positive UA and CT w/ possible pyelonephritis.  SBP
   responded to 4L IVF with CVP of 12 and SVO2 in 70-80s.  However, MAPs
   continue to be marginal and pts baseline is hypertensive.  Lactate
   remained elevated at 2.8 after fluid resuscitation.  A-line intact.
   - Continue LR boluses to maintain CVP goal of >[**9-9**].  We will try to
   keep his CVP at the higher end because his ECHO shows borderline
   pulmonary hypertension so he probably has elevated CVP at baseline.
   - Continue Levophed gtt to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for empiric coverage of UTI/Pyelo. (no history of
   ESBL)
   - f/u blood, urine cultures (narrow Abx when avail)
   - check AM/PM ABG/lactate
   # Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis:
   #Abdominal Pain: Dilated colon on CXR and in Abd CT.  Pain out of
   proportion to exam this morning.  Given his recent TIA we are concerned
   about ischemic bowel.  Given his fever and increasing leukocytosis and
   recent hospitalizationwe are also concerned for C. Diff although he
   reports normal stool yesterday and was not on antibiotics recently. It
   is also possible he has pancreatic or liver/biliary pathology. It
   appears that his abdominal imaging is unchanged from previous
   admission.
   -KUB
   -Start Empiric Flagyl for C. Diff
   -Send C. Diff cultures
   -check Amylase, Lipase, LFTs
   -Serial Abdominal exams
   - OSH records to determine chronicity of this problem.
   -Zofran and morphine for pain
   .
   # Recent TIA/MS changes: Pt noted to be lethargic at rehab and CNS
   vasculatur sensitive to low BPs given TIA [**3-1**] hypotension during recent
   admission. Neuro exam non-focal but pt not oriented to time/place.
   Most likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in setting of acute
   infection vs. baseline MS. [**Name13 (STitle) 126**] continue with aggressive IVF
   resuscitation & pressors prn to avoid hypotensive/hypoperfusion to
   CNS.  Will d/w HCP in am regarding recent baseline MS.
   - Baseline hypertension, so will continue levophed gtt to maintain
   MAP>65 and will increase for mental status decline
   - q4h neuro exams
   - treat infection: continue empiric Abx & IVF
   -speak to his HCP about baseline mental status.
   .
   # ARF: Pt with recent baseline creatinine of 1.1, currently ????
   likely due to sepsis and relative hypovolemia/hypotension.
   - monitor creatinine with aggressive IVF
   - renally dose ABx, hold nephrotoxins
   - continue Levo gtt to maintain MAP>65 to maintain kidney perfusion
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct appears to be in 26-29 range, currently  and
   normocytic after agressive resuscitation with NS and LR.   Most likely
   hemodilution
   - f/u Fe studies
   - guaic all stools
   - type & cross
   .
   # DM: Holding oral hypoglycemics, monitor BS QIDACHS
   - Humalog sliding scale coverage
   .
   # Hypertension: currently hypotensive
   - holding all BP meds for now
   - continue Aspirin 81mg
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: continue Atorvastatin 10mg daily
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now given altered mental status
   - adv diabetic diet when more alert
   - monitor lytes/replete prn
