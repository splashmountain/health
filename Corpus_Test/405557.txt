   Assessment and Plan
   40F w metastatic breast cancer to liver and brain, who was admitted to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] following seizures and PEA arrest.
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: likely [**3-2**] MSSA HAP in the setting of
   progressive metastatic malignancy.
   S/p Cipro/Vanc (6/7
 [**7-11**]). S/p zosyn x 7 days (6/7
 [**7-12**]) for MSSA
   HAP. S/p chest tube catheter placement for effusion and aggressive
   diuresis. RLL  collapse
   - zosyn ([**7-14**] - )
   - gentle diuresis, lasix PRN, goal: euvolemia to net negative
   - consider bronchoscopy and reopening RML
   - continue mechanical ventilation - AC, failing PS
   - wean propofol as tolerates
   - will likely need tracheostomy
   - CXR daily
   - monitor pulmonary secretions
   # Altered Mental Status: Without sedation seems more alert, but still
   altered. [**Month (only) 8**] be from progression of dz vs over-sedation.
   - requiring sedation to prevent agitation, will try to wean as possible
   - head CT w/o contrast for acute processes, if changes, holding off for
   now
   # Acute Renal Failure: likely [**3-2**] pre-renal etiology in the setting of
   third-spacing and aggressive diuresis. Cr peaked at 1.7, baseline 0.5.
   Fe Urea 29. Improving Cr.
   - goal euvolemia to net negative
   - monitor Cr
   - renally dose medications
   # Seizure:  Known seizure disorder [**3-2**] brain metastases.
   - monitor phenytoin levels
   - need extra dose as levels consistently low
   - continue dexamethasone to 8 mg [**Hospital1 **] for vasogenic edema
   - contiune levetiracetam
   # Anxiety:
   - lorazepam 1mg TID:prn, however, stop today for AMS
   # Metastatic Breast Cancer: Multiple family meetings with oncologist
   describing grim prognosis
 family continues to want aggressive care.
   - Cont weekly Navelbine
   - Pain control with Fentanyl
   # Sinus Tachycardia:  CTA negative for PE.  Pain is controlled.  Worse
   w respiratory distress. Most likely secondary to underlying diease and
   metastasis. ? Anxiety.
   - lorazepam being held due to AMS
   # Hypernatremia: likely due to hpyovolemia, resolved
   # s/p PEA arrest:  S/P PEA arrest [**3378-6-2**] requiring less than 2 minutes
   of chest compressions.  Felt to be secondary to hypoxia from seizure.
   No pressors and blood pressure stable. On telemetry.
   # Transaminitis: Likely [**3-2**] br ca mets. Stable.
   - cont to monitor LFTs
   ICU Care
   Nutrition:
   Replete with Fiber (Full) - [**3378-7-15**] 12:26 AM 55 mL/hour
   Lines:
   Arterial Line - [**3378-7-3**] 05:19 AM
   20 Gauge - [**3378-7-14**] 07:29 AM
   - needs PICC, but HCP refuses
   Prophylaxis:
   DVT: hep sq
   Stress ulcer: Prevacid
   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: Need to involve ethics for further management/goals of
   care
 family wants aggressive measures, but does not follow medical
   advice
