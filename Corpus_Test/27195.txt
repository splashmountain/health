Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2862-7-17**] - Mitral Valve Replacement(29mm [**Company 55**] Mosaic Porcine
Valve) and Single Vessel CABG(Left internal mammary artery to
the left anterior descending artery)


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 121**] is an 81 year old female with congestive heart
failure. She has been medically managed but has gradually
experienced worsening symptoms of dyspnea on exertion and
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. An echocardiogram in [**2861-12-6**]
showed moderate to severe mitral regurgitation and depressed LV
function. Subsequent cardiac catheterization in [**2862-5-6**]
confirmed moderate to severe MR with an LVEF of 34%. Coronary
angiography revealed a 50-60% lesion in the mid left anterior
descending artery.  Based upon the above results, she was
referred for cardiac surgical intervention. Given her history of
chronic atrial fibrillation and Warfarin anticoagulation, she
was admitted severals days prior to operative date for Warfarin
reversal and heparinization.

[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2196**]ospital Course:
On [**7-15**], Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 121**] was admitted for routine
preoperative evaluation and heparinization. Workup was
unremarkable and she was cleared for surgery. On [**7-17**], Dr.
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] performed a mitral valve replacment and single
vessel coronary artery bypass grafting. For surgical details,
please see seperate dictated operative note. Following the
operation, she was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring.
Within 24 hours, she awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. She experienced episodes of rapid atrial
fibrillation(up to 160 bpm)which was initially treated with
Amiodarone and beta blockade. Despite medical therapy, she
continued to experience episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation.
When in a normal sinus rhythm, she exhibited sinus node
dysfunction. Pronestyl therapy was attempted but without much
success. Given her multiple drug allergies, inability to
adequately control her atrial fibrillation and sinus node
dysfunction, the EP service was consulted. Based on EP
recommendations, Digoxin therapy was initiated and beta blockade
was advanced as tolerated. Warfarin anticoagulation was
eventually resumed. Once her atrial fibrillation was adequately
controlled, she eventually transferred to the SDU for further
care and recovery. Beta blockade was advanced as tolerated.
Warfarin was dosed for a goal INR between 2.0 and 3.0. Over
several days, her atrial fibrillation rate improved. She
continued to experience intermittent tachycardia(up to 120 bpm)
mostly with exertion. Toprol XL was eventually advanced to her
preoperative dose of 200 mg [**Hospital1 **]. She tolerated low dose Digoxin
as well. As medical therapy was optimized, she continued to make
clinical improvements with diuresis and made steady progress
with physical therapy. She was medically cleared for discharge
on postoperative day 10. At discharge, her oxygen saturations
were 94-96% on room air and chest x-ray showed stable mild to
moderate left pleural effusion and atelectasis. Her BP was
108/50 with a HR of 85. All surgical wounds were clean, dry and
intact.
