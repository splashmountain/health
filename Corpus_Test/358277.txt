   pressure transiently fell to systolic of 100s, but rose back up to 120s
   after IV fluid bolus was started.  He was started on octreotide gtt,
   pantoprazole gtt and transferred to MICU for further management.
   .
   Patient's other active issues include SBP, which grew multiple
   organisms including [**Female First Name (un) 176**] species.  He was started on a course of

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o man with PSC complicated by cirrhosis with known esophageal
   varices and multiple epidoses of UGIB and banding this admission,
   polymicrobial SBP, now with recurrent UGIB.
   .
   # GI bleed: 3 point hematocrit drop since last night
   -- If plan to pursue endoscopy, will need to reverse DNR/DNI status as
   EGD will require intubation.  Family notified and wishes to defer code
   status reversal discussion to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2183**]
   -- 3 units PRBC and 2 units FFP now
   -- Serial INR, fibrinogen, CBC q6H
   -- PRBC for Hct < 26, FFP for INR > 2.0, platelets if < 50
   -- PPI, octreotide gtt
   -- Maintain peripheral IV access in addition to TLC
   .
   # Persistent leukocytosis. Complicated history of peritonitis, ?
   cholangitis, and esophagitis. Cdiff has been negative. Blood and urine
   cultures negative. No PNA seen on CXR.
   -- continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) 411**] to cover for aspiration pna and peritonitis
   -- continue caspofungin for esophagitis and peritonitis with [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 176**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1612**]
   -- monitor fever curve, WBC
   .
   # ESLD/cirrhosis: On liver transplant list. Complicated by ascites,
   portal gastropathy, and SBP. No clear history of encephalopathy.
   -- ursodiol [**Hospital1 **], lactulose 30 mg daily
   -- hold spironolactone/lasix, nadolol in setting of above
   -- Continue lactulose
   .
   # Biliary strictures: Pull back cholangiography on [**11-24**] demonstrated
   no obstruction. PTC drain removed by IR [**2566-11-24**]. Bili peaked [**11-27**],
   decreasing now.
   -- Trend LFTs to assess for complications of PTC removal (ie,
   cholangitis)
