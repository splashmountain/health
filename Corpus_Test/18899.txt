HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**3316-10-7**] to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1882**] for coronary artery bypass grafting
with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease, unstable angina,
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and
hypercholesterolemia.

The patient had coronary artery bypass graft times four on
[**3316-10-7**] with left internal mammary coronary artery to left
anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal, diagonal sequential, saphenous vein graft to
PL under general anesthesia.  The patient had one
mediastinal, on right pleural and one left pleural tube
placed.  Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1882**] with the assistance of
[**Known patient firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29313**], M.D. and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6172**], P.A.  On postoperative
day one the patient was on a neo drip at .75, insulin drip of
2 and kept intubated.  The patient had increased chest tube
drainage on the morning of postoperative day one and was
moderately hemodynamically stable and chest x-ray showed
mediastinal left pleural apex hematoma.  He was taken for
reexploration for increased chest tube output and hematoma
left chest.  The patient was taken back to the Operating Room
for bleeding and upon reexploration clot in the left pleural
space was found and left internal mammary coronary artery
side branch was found to have mild bleeding.  The patient was
then taken back to the cardiac surgery recovery unit.  On
postoperative day two the patient was started on gentle
diuresis and was on a neo drip of .13 with moderate output of
chest tube.  Chest tubes were discontinued and he was weaned
to extubated.

Physical therapy began evaluating the patient on
postoperative day and continued to evaluate the patient
throughout hospital course.  On postoperative day number
three the patient was neurologically intact and the patient
had a bout of atrial fibrillation where Lopressor dose was
increased from 50 b.i.d. to 75 b.i.d.  Chest tubes were
discontinued and the patient was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day number four.  After the patient continued
to be in and out of atrial fibrillation and Lopressor was
increased to 100 b.i.d. on postoperative day four.  Heart
rate continued to be 102 on postoperative day five on the
floor and frequency of Lopressor was increased to t.i.d.
Blood sugars were also noted to be increased and [**Last Name (un) 124**] was
consulted for sugar management.  The patient had a bout of
rapid atrial fibrillation on [**3316-10-12**] 120s to 130s,
20 mg of intravenous Lopressor was pushed.  Blood pressure
remained stable at 130/50 and heart rate controlled to 110 to
120.  Dose of Cozaar 25 mg given po.  The patient was stated
on a home dose of Cozaar, however, the patient remained
asymptomatic throughout course. 150 mg of Amiodarone bolus
was given and 400 mg po of Amiodarone b.i.d.  The patient was
started on 400 mg of Amiodarone po b.i.d.  The patient
remained in sinus rhythm on postoperative day five and
Amiodarone was continued.

On postoperative day six the patient continued to do well,
however, on the night of postoperative day six the patient
went into a bout of rapid atrial fibrillation again with a
rate of 120s, stable blood pressure.  The patient was given
20 mg of intravenous Lopressor with 100 mg of Atenolol po.
He was rate controlled at 85 to 90.  The patient began a
heparin drip and anticoagulation with cardiology consulting
and following.  On [**10-15**] postoperative day number
seven the patient went to radiology for an x-ray, however,
had black out spell where the patient passed out.  An intern
was notified and the rest of the team was notified and the
patient was taken back to the unit for observation of
syncopal episode.  Cardiology was consulted at that time and
recommended TSH check and the patient was then started on
Synthroid 25 micrograms and anticoagulation was then begun
heparin 11 units an hour.  On postoperative day nine the
patient was on Amiodarone 400 t.i.d., Lasix 40 b.i.d.,
Atenolol 75 q.d. and a heparin drip at 1800 units.  Heparin
was decreased on postoperative day nine and Coumadin was
started and the patient was again transferred to the floor.

Heparin was discontinued on postoperative day ten and
Coumadin was continued at 5 mg po q.h.s. with a goal INR of 2
to 2.5.  The patient's INR on this dose was 1.8.  The patient
was discharged on postoperative day twelve to [**Location (un) **]
rehabilitation center in good condition and cleared by
physical therapy.  The rehabilitation center is to check INR
and dose Coumadin on [**10-21**] for a goal of 2 to 2.5.
The patient is to receive 5 mg of Coumadin on the night of
the 16th and from then on INR should be checked on Monday,
Wednesday and Fridays.  The patient is also instructed to
follow up with his primary care physician in one to two
