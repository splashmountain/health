Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**3011-5-13**]
IMPRESSION: Large mixed density subdural hematoma along the left
convextiy likely representing an acute on chronic process. There
is considerable mass effect secondary to the hematoma with
rightward shift of normally midline structures and associated
subfalcine and uncal herniation. No prior imaging available for
comparison.

NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: As above, there is a large
subdural hematoma with acute component, layering over the left
cerebral convexity. There is subfalcine herniation, with
trapping of the contralateral lateral ventricle. There is
significant uncal herniation, as well as downward transtentorial
herniation with rotation of the brainstem and asymmetric
widening of the ipsilateral ambient cistern. At the time of this
note, the pt. had already undergone craniotomy and evacuation of
the hematoma.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**3011-5-13**]
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process identified. Study
is generally unchanged from that of [**3007**].

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt was admitted through the emergency department after CT
scan revealed SDH on the left.  Given his poor mental status
combined with the appearance of the SDH on CT he was taken to
the OR emergently for evacuation.  His operation was uneventful
and he was extubated shortly after.  His post operative CT shows
good decompression and his exam was markedly improved.  He was
transferred out of the ICU on POD #1.  He did have hematuria
possibly [**1-4**] traumatic foley insertion.  This was hooked up to
CBI as he was passing clots and the foley was clotting off.  He
was seen by urology and they put in a large foley and
reconnected him to [**Doctor First Name **] after his current indwelling catheter was
unable to be cleared and was without ouptut. They advanced the
catheter against the wall of the bladder and drainage resumed he
had 24 hours of continous drainage and his urine out cleared.
He has been draining and more comfortable with 24 hours with
pyridium.  On [**5-18**] the foley moved into the psuedo tract and
urology had to advance the catheter with cystoscope.  It is now
draining and should remain in place until [**5-24**] with a voiding
trial.

He was seen by PT  and felt safe to go to rehab. His diet and
activity were advanced.  He was neurologically intact through
the remainer of his stay.
