CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Inferior myocardial infarction.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old male
with a history of locally advanced anaplastic bladder cancer,
status post XRT and chemotherapy; history of PE with left
lower extremity DVT diagnosed three months ago, status post
IVC filter, who patient presented with the complaints of
diaphoresis, dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting.  The patient had
been in his usual state of health until a few days prior to
admission, when he reported not feeling well.  Today, the
patient had the sudden onset of nausea and vomiting
reportedly without chest pain or dyspnea.  He presented to an
outside hospital ED, where his ECG reveals 4-mm ST elevations
in 2,3, and AVF and 2-mm ST elevations in V3 through V6 and
3-mm ST depressions in 1 and AVL.  Complete heart block was
noted with a junctional escape of 50.  The patient was given
Atropine, Dopamine, and placed on 100% nonrebreather mask for
oxygen saturations in the 80% range.  The patient was given
TNK tissue plasminogen activator.  No significant improvement
in the ST elevations were noted after the administration of
thrombolytic.  The patient was bradycardiac into the 50s with
a systolic blood pressure in the 70s and it was unclear
whether the patient was actually externally paced to a rate
of 80.  The patient was transported to [**Hospital1 470**] for management of acute inferior MI with a
complete heart block involving bradycardia cardiogenic shock.

Prior to arrival at [**Hospital1 58**], the
patient was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
Cardiac catheterization here revealed left main with no
obstruction.  The LAD showed tight mid stenosis, which was
not intervened upon.  The RCA had a 90% proximal
posterolateral, totally occluded distal posterolateral and
70% ostial RCA lesion.  Stents were placed across the
proximal posterolateral and ostial RCA with PTCA of the
distal posterolateral.  The left circumflex had moderate
diffuse disease.  The LVDP was 18, no right heart
catheterization was performed secondary to the IVC filter.

Post intervention EKG showed normal sinus at a rate of 85
with Q waves in the inferior leads and improved 2-mm ST
elevation in 2, 3, and F; resolution of anterior ST
elevations was also noted and T-wave inversions were present
in 2, 3, S, and V3 through V5.  The patient was transferred
to the Coronary Care Unit for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Bladder cancer status post XRT and chemotherapy,
anaplastic locally advanced.
2.  Status post recent cystoscopy on [**2608-4-22**], which
revealed response to chemotherapy, but bimanual examination
under anesthesia confirmed a left immobile pelvic mass
suggesting extravesicle invasive disease.  The patient was
currently undergoing palliative chemotherapy with
Gemcitabine.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Left lower extremity DVT diagnosed three months ago
status post IVC filter placement.  Coumadin recently
discontinued for hematuria secondary to the patient's bladder
carcinoma.
5.  Status post cholecystectomy.
6.  Status post right hip fracture in [**2601**].

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Hydralazine.
2.  Labetalol.
3.  Terazosin.
4.  Zestril.
5.  Senna.
6.  Coumadin.
7.  Melatonin.
8.  Pyridium.
9.  Iron sulfate.
10. Cystospaz.
11. Dulcolax.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 96.5, blood pressure 110/60, rate
90 in normal sinus rhythm and respiratory rate 16.
Ventilator settings were IMV 10/700, 80% FIO2 with PEEP of 5,
first ABG 7.28/43/336.  GENERAL:  The patient was intubated
and sedated.  HEENT:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to
light.  Extraocular movements cannot be tested.  Trachea
midline.  JVP at 12 cm.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Normal S1 and S2,
no S3 present.  PULMONARY:  Examination revealed that the
patient is clear to auscultation bilaterally on anterior
examination.  ABDOMEN:  Benign, no hepatosplenomegaly noted.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm.  The left lower extremity has 2+ edema
and there are 2+ pulses on both side.  The right groin site
dressing appears clean, dry, and intact with the sheath in.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit for management of respiratory failure, recent heart
block and recent cardiogenic shock.  The patient was quickly
extubated within the first twenty-four hours of his
admission.  The patient's CKs appeared to peak at 1000.  The
patient remained chest pain free throughout the rest of his
admission.  Telemetry remained unremarkable also.  He was
started on aspirin, Plavix, and beta blocker, ACE inhibitor
and statin for his ischemic disease.  He did experience some
hematuria in the immediate post procedure time thought
secondary to the bladder cancer and use of Aggrastat.

On [**2608-5-23**], the patient reported positional dizziness with
turning of the head to the left that was new in onset.  He
also reported diplopia, which he said was old, but which his
wife said was new.  Moreover, it was noted that the patient's
speech was slightly slurred, although appropriate.  Given the
fact that the patient has a known cancer and had received
lytics at an outside hospital and also had focal neurological
complaints with examination notable for left-sided dysmetria,
head CT was obtained, which revealed left cerebellar
infarction with increased pressure in the posterior fossa.
Neurology and neurosurgical consultation was obtained.  The
patient was monitored closely with frequent neurological
checks and appeared to be clinically stable.  Repeat head CT
twenty-four hours after the initial revealed no change in the
findings.  The patient was never given Mannitol or any other
therapeutic modalities to reduce the intracranial pressure.

On [**2608-5-24**], the patient was transferred to the floor for
further neurological monitoring and optimization of his
cardiac regimen.

Echocardiogram was also obtained on [**2608-5-24**], which revealed
the following:  EF 25% to 30%; E to A ratio of 0.57 with
estimated PA systolic pressure of 33; moderate [**Hospital1 **]-atrial
dilatation noted as was moderate RV and LV dilation; mild MR
noted; mild aortic root dilatation was also noted.  There
were multiple areas of apical and posterior akinesis.

Given the patient suppressed EF and mild clinical heart
failure necessitating nasal cannula oxygen, the patient was
aggressively diuresed and appeared to tolerate this well.

On [**2608-5-27**] the patient was felt to be stable for discharge
to a rehabilitation.  Of note:  Urinalysis was sent of his
chronic indwelling Foley, which was notable for large blood,
greater than 10 white blood cell per high power field and
nitrite positivity.  He was started on a course of
Cipro for this.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post inferior MI complicated by complete heart
block and transient cardiogenic shock.
2.  Left cerebellar infarction of subacute duration with
radiographic evidence of increased posterior fossa
intracranial pressure.
