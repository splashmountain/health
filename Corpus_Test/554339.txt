   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 63 year old male with history of coronary artery disease
   status-post CABG in [**5-/3088**], presents with hypotension, bradycardia,
   epigastric pain, found severe pancreatitis with ARDS and persistent
   pressor requirement, with improved respiratory status, and renal
   function today, weaned off of pressors.
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic respiratory failure and now ARDS.
   Intubated in setting of respiratory distress, also given need for
   aggressive IVF resuscitation. Patient was on paralytics for about 24
   hours to facilitate tolerance of AC mode and lessen resistance. He mets
   ARDS criteria in setting of pancreatitis and possible aspiration event
   at home. RV dysfunction also noted on transthoracic echo (likely from
   ARDS and positive-pressure ventilation, and catecholamines from
   ARDS/pancreatitis) which has been likely etiology of transient
   hypotension and hypoxia with movement.
   - He remains at goal 6cc/kg ARDSnet ventilation protocol, continue
   current TV and rate settings, will aim to wean FiO2 down to 40%, then
   work  weaning down PEEP.
   - Continue to diuresis down to CVP <5 to help fluid status, on lasix
   gtt currently with good urine output (was net out 1 L since midnight)
   - Continue vancomycin and meropenem, added ciprofloxacin on [**12-18**] to
   extend coverage against gram negative rods for question of possible VAP
   or resistance organisms (stopped flagyl as  c. difficile negative).
   Will plan to continue all for 7 day course (started [**12-15**], last day
   would be [**3088-12-21**]), pending any further culture data (has not had
   secretions). Will call to have sputum culture further speciated.
   - Continue sedation with fentanyl and versed, lighten up today to
   assess mental status better.
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis. Based on
   gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of this
   imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides. Appeared that patient has SIRS related to his
   pancreatitis given his persistent hypotension. Intubated for hypoxia,
   had initial bradycardia and hypotension which resolved w/IVF.
   Greatly appreciate surgery and ERCP recommendations and assistance.
   Abdominal examination has improved.
   - Patient is status-post > 11 liters of IVF
initially had held off on
   further fluid resuscitation for hypotension given concerns about
   oxygenation and worsening of abdominal compartment syndrome in setting
   of poor urine output. Given that his bladder pressure remains
   relatively low ([**8-30**]) and he has significant (likely post-ATN)
   auto-diuresis, was able to wean pressors.
   - Per surgery, no need for repeat imaging at this time, as this would
   have risk of further dye exposure in setting of resolving ARF, and
   already on appropriate antibiotics (and HD stable, so surgical
   intervention not desired)
   - ERCP team aware of patients.
   - Treat w/broad spectrum Abx: Vanc/meropenam (day 1=[**12-16**]), cipro
   started [**12-18**], will continue to [**3088-12-21**].
   - Continuing to trend [**Doctor First Name **]/lipase, HCT, WBCs, calcium, (lactate has been
   normal)
   - Triglycerides were within normal limits
   - Sedation to fentanyl/versed
   - Appreciate surgical assistance.
   - Insulin gtt for hyperglycemia
   # Hypotension: Resolved: patient has been off neo and vasopressin since
   AM of [**12-19**]. Hypotension with movement as noted above likely secondary
   to decreased venous return and forward flow with movement. Overall
   hypotension most likely secondary to significant third spacing of
   fluids in abdomen from pancreatitis, leading to hypovolemia, as well as
   SIRS from his pancreatitis. No new clear wall motion abnormalities on
   transthoracic echocardiogram. Status post over 14 L of fluid during his
   stay.
   # EKG changes, history of CAD: Do not suspect new ischemic event, but
   instead some low levels of demand ischemia secondary to hypotension and
   stress of infection/SIRS/pancreatitis with circulating catecholamies.
   Patient noted to have new TWI in V1, V2, with <1 mm of STE in inferior
   leads- STE noted on prior EKGs from [**5-27**]. Patient does have h/o recent
   4vCABG in 6/[**3087**]. At this time, risks continue to outweigh benefits for
   anticoagulation given concern of hemorrhagic transformation/necrosis.
   Cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] morning after admission and reviewed EKG and
   case, felt current EKG was not significantly different from old, STE
   could be ventricular aneurismal in nature. No other recommendations for
   change in management, as management of his pancreatitis was felt to be
   larger priority.
   - CE trending downward, stopped checking.
   - Holding statin in the setting of elevated LFTs
   - Continue ASA (PR if possible, currently with diarrhea, while NG tube
   is to suction)
   - Transfuse for HCT goal >25
   - Hold BB in the setting of hypotension, if tolerated once off
   pressors, start esmolol gtt
   - Transthoracic echo today as noted above, suspect depressed RV
   function noted could be in setting of ARDS
   # ARF: Marked improvement to 1.3 today. Suspected ATN secondary to
   severe third spacing and relative hypovolemia causing hypotension, also
   with possible component of abdominal compartment syndrome. Patient also
   received dye with CT at OSH so contrast nephropathy also a possibility.
   Urine output has remained stable.
   # Leukocytosis: Resolved.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Today patient with sodium 149, again suspect secondary
   to inability to give PO water, insensible losses, and diuresis. Will
   contact nutrition to see if can deliver more free water with TPN, also
   give D5W. Will check again in PM.
    # Abdominal distension: Patient without bowel movement for last 24
   hrs, had previously had diarrhea. Continues to have diminished bowel
   sounds. Blood pressure has been good, and lactate had been normal, so
   less concern for mesenteric ischemia, but will need to remain mindful
   of this.

   ------ Protected Section ------
   Will also place request for PICC line given patient does not have
   enough access for all needed medications/TPN (due to
   incompatibilities), and inability to place additional peripheral IV
   This may also allow us to remove his central line.
