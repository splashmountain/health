1. ET tube is seen, with the tip in the right main stem
bronchus. Withdrawal is recommended by several cm.

edema, or a superimposed infectious process. Clinical
correlation is recommended.

[**10-1**]. Presented from rehab after becoming hypertenive, hypoxic
and unresponsive, likely had flash pulmonary edema. Patient was
intubated and brought to [**Hospital1 52**]. Patient was in florid CHF with
possible aspiration pna after vomitting during OT insertion and

discontinued. Continued on ASA, plavix, simvastatin. started
lopressor 12.5 PO TID and isosorbide mononitrate ER was changed
from 60mg to 30mg QD secondary to hypotension on both bb and
