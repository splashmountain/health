Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 793**]
Chief Complaint:
Right elbow pain and redness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mechanical Ventilation


History of Present Illness:
27M with Hajdu-[**Location (un) 4814**] Syndrome, with restrictive lung disease
[**2-7**] kyphoscoliosis and COPD on home O2 4L NC and SIMV by
ventilator, currently undergoing treatment for  R olecranon
osteomyelitis on Daptomycin presents from PCP with worsening [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
elbow pain and swelling x 2d.
.
Pt initially admitted [**Date range (1) 4819**] with a non-healing ulcer over R
elbow and concern for osteomyelitis as he was noted to have
fluctuance over the elbow. At that time  the lesion expressed a
large amount of largely serous fluid. A swab was sent and grew
mixed flora. An MRI of elbow was not possible as patient was
unable to position his arm as required for scan. Bone scan
performed on [**8-4**] read as osteomyelitis of right elbow. He was
discharged on vancomycin 1gm IV q8 via PICC.
.
Pt was then readmitted on [**8-15**] with SOB and found to have
Coagnegative Staph and  VRE. TTE which was negative for evidence
of endocarditis. He was then changed from Vanco to Daptomycin.
Two other superficial wound swabs were sent from his R elbow
ulcer with subsequent growth of Coagnegative Staph and P.
aeruginosa on [**8-16**] and CoNS on [**8-17**].
.

Pt seen in [**Hospital **] clinic on [**8-25**], doing well overall, with reports
of drainage being increasingly bloody but decreased in amount
since the time of his initial discharge.
.

The patient presented to PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**9-4**] with worsening R elbow pain
and swelling x 2d and sent to [**Hospital1 4**] for evaluation.

.
Right Elbow Plain Film:
In comparison with the study of [**8-1**], there is again diffuse
demineralization of the visualized bony elements. On the lateral
view, the
previously described soft tissue defect posterior to the
olecranon is not
appreciated. However, there is now substantially more soft
tissue swelling in the region. No definite bone erosion is
appreciated. No evidence of
posterior fat pad indicating joint effusion. If there is serious
question
about the possibility of osteomyelitis, MRI would be the next
imaging
procedure.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
27M with Hajdu-[**Location (un) 4814**] Syndrome and chronic restrictive and
obstructive pulmonary disease with a non-healing R elbow
ulceration with suspected osteomyelitis admitted with clinical
worsening despite 2 weeks of IV daptomycin. Admitted to the MICU
becuase of ventilation requirement at night. Was seen by
orthopedics, infectious disease, and wound care. The patient
showed no systemic signs or symptoms of infection, and the
worsening pain and erythema was felt to be due to
pressure-related trauma. The patient uses the arm to move
around, and when padding and protection was applied, the
erythema and pain improved. The patient will follow up with PT
and OT as an outpatient to ensure that the right elbow is
protected, and wound care recommendations were provided to the
patient for VNA to follow-up with. He will also continue
daptomycin IV with regualrly scheduled visits with infectious
disease.
