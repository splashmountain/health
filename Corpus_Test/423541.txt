   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o blind, deaf male w/ESRD, s/p cath on [**7-22**] with stenting of
   distal LAD stenosis.  Patient had continued chest pain and was again
   taken to cath which was complicated by LMCA dissection and cardiac
   arrest.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Cath [**7-22**]: LAD w/ 3 sequential stents widely patient. 50%
   lesion at D1 proximal to stents. 60% diffuse disease between 2nd and
   3rd stents; 90% focal lesion just distal to 3rd stent (new since [**4-3**]).
   D1 with proximal 90% disease (unchanged). New stent placed over distal
   LAD lesion. Procedure stopped prematurely secondary to patient
   agitation. Patient continued to have chest pain requiring nitroglycerin
   for chest pain overnight, EKG's consistently unchanged. Unrelieved with
   maalox, GI cocktail. Trop 0.63 morning of [**7-23**]. Was 0.97 at OSH.   The
   patient underwent a second cath with successful angioplasty to the D1
   and successful PCI of prox/mid LAD with DES.  This procedure was
   complicated by LMCA dissection which caused cardiac arrest requiring
   CPR, atropine, and intubation.  The LMCA dissection was corrected by
   LMCA stenting.
   -Continue Aspirin, plavix, lipitor
   -Start metoprolol 25mg PO BID this am
   -Imdur restarted this AM
   -Continue to trend enzymes post LMCA dissection and cardiac arrest to
   evaluate extent of heart damage
   -ECHO in AM
   -EKG
   -lisinopril 2.5mg daily
   .
   # PUMP: Has known ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 35% on [**4-3**] Echo. No
   overt clinical signs of heart failure at this time. No peripheral
   edema, crackles, or JVD.
   -Will add an ACE inhibitor when BP allows
   .
   # RHYTHM: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Sinus rhythm today.
   -C/w amiodarone, start metoprolol yesterday
   .
   # Hypotension: Currently on dopamine given peripherally with goal to
   maintain pressures above 90s-100s systolic
   -C/w metoprolol, ACE inhibitor
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient intubated and sedated following code.  Continue
   Versed/Fentanyl as needed for sedation on vent.  Patient can likely be
   extubated tomorrow morning as vent settings are on assist control with
   Tidal volume=500 cc, Respiratory rate: 18, PEEP: 5 cm/h2o, FIO2: 50%.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct dropped from 30.9 pre-procedure to 24.8 post-procedure
   which is out of proportion to what would be an expected blood loss from
   cath.  Concern for retroperitoneal bleed.  Hct up to 27.6 this AM
   -Hct checks q8h
   -Will transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs and monitor post transfusion Hct
   -Premedicate with Tylenol 1 gram and Benadryl 25mg IV as patient has
   low grade temperature of 99.7
   .
   # ESRD w/ HD on MWF: Underwent normal session of HD Friday morning
   prior to cath.
   -C/w Nephrocaps, renagel
   -F/u renal recs
   .
   # Gout
   -C/w allopurinol
   .
   # Congenital deafness: Can read lips effectively at baseline. Will
   involve ASL interpreters as needed when patient extubated.
   .
   # Peptic ulcer disease, dyspepsia: Famotidine for now.
   .
   FEN: NPO for now, consider OG tube feeds if not extubated tomorrow
   .
   ACCESS: PIV, HD cath
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -Famotidine 20mg PO
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   -Bowel regimen with docusate
   .
   CODE: Presumed full
   .
   DISPO: CCU for now
