   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 3895**] is a 55M who presents with AMS found to have multiple CVAs
   #) CVA: Bilateral thalamic infarcts and R pontine infarct.  Likely
   reason for his somnolence and persistent R sided weakness.
   -Continue ASA, statin
   - f/u Neuro recs
   #)DM: Difficult to control, with some improvement overnight
   -- Continue insulin gtt and NPH 100 units [**Hospital1 **]
   #) Fevers/SOB: Started on Vancomycin and Zosyn for HAP. He spiked
   overnight again, vanc level sub therapeutic
   -- Surveillance cultures
   -- Continued Vanc/Zosyn, adjust dose of Vanc to 1000mg Q8H
   -- Keep sacro-iliitis in differential diagnosis
   -- Would also consider possible reaction to drugs given question of
   rash to ceftriaxone
   -- Would also consider possibility of PE given sinus tachycardia and
   fever
   #) HTN: Continue to titrate Captopril
   #) OSA: Continue auto-CPAP

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 55M DM, HTN, OSA and multiple CVAs c/b
   altered mental status, fevers likely [**1-17**] HAP, and poor glycemic
   control, now on high dose insulin drip  with new PICC line.
   Overnight events : Pan cx for repeat spike to 101.2. Bolus 500 cc x 1
   for tachycardia with fever. Increased NPH to 80 [**Hospital1 **] and getting 7 units
   hr of IV insulin
   Exam notable for Tm 101.2 BP 120-150/50 HR 90-110 RR 18 with sat 97% on
   CPAP.  JVD 6cm, lungs with distant BS, RRR s1s2. Abd soft, + BS, mild
   to mod pedal edema. Hemiplegia RUE >RLE.
   Labs notable for WBC 8K, HCT 44%, Cr 0.8, FSG 158. VBG 7.45/ PvCo2 44
   CXR with decreased RLL infiltrate
   Fevers: Agree with plan to continue antibiotics for likely
   HAP/aspiration with close monitoring of respiratory status and CPAP
   O/N. Vanco has been subtherapuetic, adjust dose to 1OOO TID and repeat
   levels. Other possible sources would be prostatitis
 given pelvic
   adenopathy on MRI and + UA, sinusitis, sacro- ilitis.  Start with
   getting Vanco in proper range but if persistent spikes may need repeat
   imaging.
   Glycemic control: Will continue CZI gtt while on TFs and increase NPH
   to 100 [**Hospital1 **] given poor glycemic control, get [**Last Name (un) 257**] consult today to
   assist with very difficult glycemic control.
   Neuro: Will continue ASA / lipitor s/p CVA; neuro following. Mental
   status waxes and wanes.
   Resp: ABGs have previously reflected good gas exchange; OSA has been
   controlled with autoset CPAP at 8-15 overnight. VBG stable.
   Patient is critically ill.
   Total time: 45 minutes.
   Addendum: extopy at 10:30 AM with frequent PVCs. Stat K and Mg. Check
   12 lead ecg and cycle enzymes.
