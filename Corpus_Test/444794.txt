TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 MULTI LUMEN - START [**3209-10-30**] 01:00 PM
   tip of 20 cm cath is in lt illiac vein,. placed in IR with tip just
   before entering stent in IVC
   - Access: IR procedure to get temporary Quad-lumen done. Placed quad in
   a stent and left existing femoral in place. Can't use TPN in new quad
   b/c will clog up in stent. So, old femoral will be dedicated to tpn and
   new quad will be for everything else.
   - temporarily off vasopressin (about one and a half hours) then became
   hypotensive even after fluid boluses. Re-started vasopressin and
   continued fluid boluses. Got 2 L NS and 1 L of LR.
   - final TTE IMPRESSION: No vegetations or clinically-significant
   regurgitant valvular disease seen. Normal global and regional
   biventricular systolic function. Mild pulmonary hypertension
   - f/u pending cultures
   - Can re-start plavix 48 hours s/p quad placement as if anything
   happens to quad it will happen in 48 hours per IR. Also consider
   holding if getting TEE on Monday.
   - pt will need to get another procedure to replace Quad-lumen to get
   Double-lumen catheter again before leaving the hospital
   - TEE to look for vegetations will happen on Monday; cards couldn't do
   it Friday.
   - c. diff #3 pending
   - Did not give boluses overnight b/c doesn't have a foley. In AM, try
   giving a bolus of LR if still not off pressors.
   - FSBS in 260s overnight with TPN. Gave 4 units of regular insulin.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old woman with history of TPN-dependence leading to
   many complications of intravenous lines including infection, clots,
   etc. p/w
   .
   HYPOTENSION
   Associated with fever earlier. [**Month (only) 56**] be related to infection; switched to
   Daptomycin, Meropenem, Ambisone per ID recs.  ID concerned about
   another Malassezia infection due to pt
s recent history of Malassezia
   bacteremia.  If it were bacterial, it would have grown on the cultures
   sooner, but this fungus can take much longer to appear.  Watery ostomy
   output, C-dif negative, vomiting prior to admission, may still be
   volume down.  Cortisol normal.
   - Weaned off of levophed and now on vasopressin. Is currently off
   vasopressin, but will
   - continue Ambisone, Meropenem (Day 1 [**10-29**]) and Daptomycin (day 1 [**10-28**])
   - Patient with hyponatremia this morning, further IV fluids will
   receive NS
   - cultures pending, but all with NGTD
   SUB-ACUTE STROKE
   Word finding difficulty noted by patient to be new over the last [**1-30**]
   weeks, noted also by family to be new within the last 1 week.  Areas of
   hypodensity on CT head without contrast in L basal ganglia and L
   cerebellum.  Given history of clots and bacteremia, concern for
   thromboembolism or septic embolism.  Pt cannot have MRI given placement
   of hardware in early [**3180**].  Neuro does not think this is a subacute
   stroke.
   - change from lovenox to sub-cutaneous heparin 5000 units per neuro due
   to concern for possible septic thrombus that could bleed, pt has h/o
   bleeding with lovenox
   - TEE to evaluate for clots/vegetations on Monday
   .
   ACCESS: Patient with difficult access. TPN/Hickman with double lumen
   and quad lumen in left femoral as well, but placed in a stent in the
   vein so will be unable to give TPN,  but can use for
   pressors/abx/fluids
   - Hold plavix in 48 hours s/p procedure, then restart if no
   complications with new line per IR
   - continue sub-cutaneous heparin for now.
   .
   PAST PULMONARY EMBOLISM
   Pt not on Coumadin due to antibiotic interactions, difficulties with
   absorption. Her Lovenox was stopped in the past, per OMR "because the
   injections gave her welts, which bled."
   - on subcutaneous heparin
   - restart plavix  likely post TEE on Monday
   .
   ANEMIA Stable at 24.
   - guaiac trace positive [**10-29**]
   - s/p transfusion of 1 unit PRBCs [**10-29**]
   - monitor daily Hcts
   - will follow up prior anemia work up, especially since she is now on
   daptomycin which can cause marrow suppression
   .
   FEN: IVF, TPN, replete electrolytes.  Potassium low, repleted with 60
   meq, Mg low, repleted
   - will continue TPN now that patient has additional access, TPN through
   her original line with ethanol dwells
   - continue magnesium and potassium sliding scale repletion.
   - pt usually gets IV ativan for anxiety, but will get sublingual ativan
   PRN because of her decreased access
   - will touch base with nutrition about insulin in her TPN
