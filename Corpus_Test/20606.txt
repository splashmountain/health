ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 71-year-old
male with progressively enlarged juxta-renal abdominal aortic
aneurysm who had been followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 224**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 222**] on the
vascular surgery service for about a year and a half. His
abdominal aneurysm had been slowly enlarging and therefore it
was decided that he would need to undergo elective repair.
His operative planning was complicated by the presence of a
large parastomal hernia at the site of his left end
colostomy. The plan was for him to undergo an aneurysm via a
right retroperitoneal approach. Preoperatively the patient
was noted to have symptomatic coronary artery disease and
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 4 months before the
planned surgery. He was given several months to recover from
this and presented for an elective repair of an aneurysm on
[**3461-10-14**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient presented electively as noted
on [**3461-10-14**], and underwent a repair of his juxta-
renal abdominal aortic aneurysm using a right retroperitoneal
approach with an 18 mm tube graft. Intraoperatively the
anatomy of the aneurysm required placement of the aortic
cross clamp above the renal arteries. In addition significant
thrombus was idenytified and removed form the aortic segment.
Otherwise there was no
noted significant intraoperative complication, but he did not
make very much urine during the case. He was brought
intubated to the cardiovascular intensive care unit
postoperatively and his course was initially noted for
minimal urine output of approximately 5 cc per hour. The
nephrology service was consulted and followed along making
management recommendations, but this was a possible
anticipated outcome given the position of the aortic cross
clamp. The patient was aggressively hydrated and resuscitated
on the evening of postoperative day 0. He remained
hemodynamically normal but required continued ventilatory
supports. Early on the morning of postoperative day 1 the
patient was noted to have increasing IV fluid requirements
with a rising base deficit and a progressively rising lactic
acidosis. His pulses were noted to be diminished in his lower
extremities and there was a small degree of mottling along
his thigh. Given that the aorta was quite calcified
intraoperatively there was concern that he may have dislodged
some debris and embolized distally into his mesenteric
circulation or his lower extremities. Aggressive IV fluid
resuscitation was continued and intravenous antibiotics were
started over a concern for possible mesenteric ischemia. The
patient's creatinine kinase continued to rise, raising
concern for ischemia to the lower extremities. The general
surgery service was consulted for evaluation for the possible
mesenteric ischemia. After fluid
resuscitation as there was no significant improvement, the
patient was taken urgently back to the operating room and at
that time was found to have thrombosis in his distal aorta
proximal to bifurcation of the iliac. The massive fluid
resuscitation had caused a significant degree of edema in the
abdomen, and the general surgery service performed a
decompressive laparotomy for the presence of abdominal
compartment syndrome. The patient was transferred back to the
cardiovascular intensive care unit after his decompressive
laparotomy, his aortic thrombectomy, revision of his repair,
and restoration of flow to his lower extremities. It was
noted that he had likely showered emboli to his gluteal
arteries for which he was heparinized. He continued to remain
critically ill and developed progressively increasing
requirements for ventilatory support with significant
pulmonary edema postoperatively. His renal function continued
to deteriorate and continuous [**Last Name (un) 1967**]-[**Last Name (un) 1967**] hemodialysis was
started in conjunction with nephrology consultation. The
cardiology and electrophysiology services were following for
recommendations regarding his pacemaker. By postoperative day
2 the patient continued to remain critically ill. He was
requiring high dose vasopressors including continuous
epinephrine infusion, norepinephrine infusion, and
vasopressor infusion to maintain a mean arterial pressure of
60 mmHg. Given his multi-system organ failure which had
developed by postoperative day 2, a family meeting was held
with the daughter and the decision was made to withdraw care
on the morning of postoperative day 3 if no significant
change occurred overnight. Late in the evening of
postoperative day 2 the patient went into a V-tach arrest.
Advanced cardiac life support was initiated and the patient
was resuscitated and regained a perfusing rhythm. Several
hours later, early on the morning of postoperative 3, the
patient again went into a V-tach arrest for which advanced
cardiac life support was again reinitiated. This progressed
into episodes of asystole. CPR and ACLS were continued for
approximately 60 minutes without maintainable restoration of
his perfusing rhythm. As we were unable to resuscitate the
patient at this time, he was pronounced dead at 12:42 a.m. on
[**10-17**], postoperative day 3. The coroner declined to
perform an autopsy. The family declined an autopsy. The [**Location (un) **] Organ Bank was notified for protocol.
