   Assessment and Plan
   47yo gentleman with h/o HIV, ESRD s/p cadaveric kidney transplant, and
   SVC syndrome previously on ASA and [**Year (4 digits) 1454**], admitted with upper GI
   bleed.
   #GI Bleed:
   s/p EGD with cauterization/injection of active bleeding ulcer ([**9-19**]);
   s/p 4units RBCs yesterday without issue (s/p total of 10units); sinus
   tachycardia in 100-120
s (baseline HR is 90-100); 3pt HCT drop from
   32.4
29.4 O/N. s/p plateletx1unit. Trauma line in place.
   - will d/w GI regarding repeat EGD considering [**Month (only) 36**] HCT drop.
   - Will hold off from transfusing again until d/w GI.
   - IV pantoprazole 8mg/hr gtt
   - monitor on tele
   - currently left femoral Advanced Vascular Access line
   - appreciate surgery and GI input
   # h/o SVC syndrome s/p L BCL stent and h/o RUE DVTs previously on
   [**Month (only) **] and ASA before admission, holding for GIB. Presents with left
   facial swelling. Etiologies include dependent edema (from lying on Left
   side) or exacerbation of SVC syndrome with stenosis of stent; s/p
   platelet unitx1.
   -Holding ASA and [**Month (only) **] [**1-18**] to GIB until HCT stabilize.
   - U/S of left upper extremities.
   # HTN:
   Patient's SBP continues to remain elevated with max of SBP 220
   yesterday.
   - hold all anti hypertensives during acute bleed
   - will provide anti-hypertensives (eg: hydralazine) PRN
   # ESRD s/p R renal transplant. Appreciate renal recs.
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Baseline Cr 1.9-2.4, current Cr stable at 2.2.
   - continue cellcept (mycophenolate mofetil) and tacrolimus (Prograf);
   - will decrease Solumedrol from 20mg to 15mg IV q12hr per surgery.
   - f/u tacro level
   -follow lytes and urine output
   # Respiratory status:
   Stable on RA, sating in high 90
s. Etiology most likely pulm edema
   (secondary to IVR/pRBCs).
   - monitor respiratory status with careful IV hydration
   #Elevated Liver Enzymes: Continue to be mildly elevated LFTs; likely
   medication induced (eg: dapsone) vs ischemia (decreased HCT and O2
   delivery) vs infection (eg: viral; unlikely as LFTs not chronically or
   significantly elevated).
   -follow LFTs
   # HIV/AIDS:
   -Continue Combivir (Lamivudine-Zidovudine), efavirenz, and abacavir
   -continue dapsone and azithromycin prophylaxis
   # Depression: Affect continues to be very flat.
   - continue mirtazipine
   - social work consult
   # FEN:  NPO for possible EGD/GI intervention; will d/w GI to see if we
   can advance to clears.
   # PPX: ppi IV BID, pneumoboots
   # ACCESS: femoral Trauma line on left side given right sided kidney
   transplant.
   # CODE: Full
   # CONTACT: Pt or Wife- [**Name (NI) 925**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5647**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5648**].
   # DISPO:  MICU care for now
