Service:  CARDIAC

ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:  1) Coronary artery disease.  2)
Myocardial infarction.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  1) Coronary artery disease.  2)
Myocardial infarction.  3) Status post coronary artery bypass
graft x 3.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65-year-old
male who was being transferred from [**Hospital3 803**].  He
presented to that hospital while complaints of sudden onset
nausea and vomiting.  EKG there demonstrated inferolateral ST
elevation MI with decreased ST anterior lead suggestive of
posterior involvement.  The patient is transferred for urgent
cardiac catheterization.  He received aspirin, heparin,
Aggrestat, prior to departure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Hypercholesterolemia.  2)
Hypertension.  3) Angina.

MEDICATIONS:  1) lipitor, 2) Nitroglycerin prn.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs - temperature 96.9, heart
rate 91, blood pressure 83-88/50-60, oxygen saturation 100%,
weight 89.4 kg.  General - the patient is intubated and
sedated postcatheterization.  Neck is supple, midline, with
no masses or lymphadenopathy.  No bruit.  Cardiovascular -
regular rate and rhythm.  Patient currently has an
intra-aortic balloon pump.  Chest clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities are warm, noncyanotic, no redness x 4.  Palpable
distal pulses.

LABS ON ADMISSION:  CBC - 7.8/38.8/162.  INR 1.3, PTT 77.
Chemistries 140/3.5/104/26/20/0.9.  First set of cardiac
enzymes - CK 120, MB 5, troponins negative, less than 0.3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred via LifeFlight
for emergent cardiac catheterization.  Cardiac
catheterization revealed a right dominant coronary
circulation with severe three-vessel coronary artery disease.
Left main had 20% distal tapering, LAD was totally occluded
proximally after the takeoff of a diffusely diseased diagonal
branch, moderate sized RI had 80% proximal lesion, left
circumflex is totally occluded, RCA was a large vessel with
40% lesion in the proximal aspect and a thrombotic occlusion
midvessel.  An intra-aortic balloon was deployed after
stenting of the RCA because of the patient's hypotension and
requirement of a dopamine drip.  Subsequent to
catheterization, the patient was transferred to the CCU for
support.  He was continued on his dopamine drip.

On hospital day #1, the patient was seen to have a brief run
of NSVT.  He was maintained on aspirin, heparin drip and
statin.  Cardiothoracic surgery consultation was obtained who
agreed with urgent revascularization.  The patient had
several further runs of what looked to be V-tach in the unit.
The patient was maintained on IABP.  Dopamine was weaned off
on hospital day #3.

On [**3153-12-21**], the patient was taken to the operating room for
urgent coronary artery bypass graft x 3.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the CSRU
postoperatively.

On postoperative day #1, the patient was extubated.  He was
A-paced at a rate of 70s.  The patient was on multiple drips
including amiodarone, insulin, neo, epi, at different times
through his CSRU course.  They were all weaned appropriately.


On postoperative day #2, the balloon pump was discontinued.
Neo was also weaned off.  The patient had a brief run of
atrial fibrillation.  Once the patient began working with
physical therapy, it was seen that he had some difficulties
with abduction of both of his arms.  He appeared
neurologically intact and without any other sensorimotor
deficits.  The patient did have other episodes of rapid
atrial fibrillation, but ultimately converted back to a sinus
rhythm.  He was begun on anticoagulation for this.

The patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day
#3.  OT consultation was also obtained who agreed with
transfer to rehab facility.  The patient had ultimately an
unremarkable floor stay, and chest tubes and wires were
removed appropriately.  The patient was ultimately discharged
to rehab facility for further work with movement of his arms,
as well as simple gait conditioning and activities of daily
living.  He was discharged tolerating a regular diet, and
adequate pain control on PO pain meds, and having a
therapeutic INR.  No more episodes of angina, or nausea or
vomiting.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  An elderly man in no
acute distress.  Vital signs were stable, afebrile.  Chest
was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular was
regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
There was no sternal click or sternal drainage.  Abdomen was
soft, nontender, nondistended, no masses or organomegaly.
Extremities were warm, noncyanotic with 1+ pedal edema
bilaterally.  Musculoskeletal - the patient had difficulty
with abduction of his arms and neural usage of his arms
particularly when trying to abduct them beyond a horizontal
level.  Neuro grossly intact without specific sensory
deficits.  Of note, the upper extremity movement was
bilateral in nature, but function was returning.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  1) lopressor 25 mg [**Hospital1 12**], 2) lasix
20 mg qd x 10 days, 3) potassium chloride 20 mEq qd x 10
days, 4) amiodarone 400 mg [**Hospital1 12**], 5) Lipitor 10 mg qd, 6)
percocet 5/325, [**11-19**] q 4 h prn, 7) aspirin 325 mg qd, 8)
ibuprofen 400 mg q 6 h, 9) colace 100 mg [**Hospital1 12**], 10) coumadin to
be dosed appropriately to an INR between 1.5 and 2.0.  On
discharge, the patient was taking coumadin in the 1 to 2 mg qd
range.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISPOSITION:  To rehab facility.

DIET:  Cardiac.

INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient should follow-up in one to two
weeks with his cardiologist.  He should address the needs of
diuresis and/or adjustment of cardiac medications at that
time.  The patient should follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 287**] in four
week's time. The patient is to continue aggressive physical
and occupational therapy to return to his activities of daily
living.  INR checks should be done twice weekly and coumadin
dosing adjusted by either the rehab facility or his primary
care provider, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] alternatively the coumadin clinic.
