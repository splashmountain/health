   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo M with h/o etoh cirrhosis admitted with recent vomiting and now
   unresponsiveness.  Found to be in renal failure with hyperammonemia.
   Altered mental status:  Improving Mental status overnight.  Putting
   picture together, seems most c/w hepatic encephalopathy in the setting
   of recent increase in vomiting and dehydration and respiratory
   alkalosis
     -Continue Lactulose and rifaximin
     -There does not appear to be enough fluid to in abdomen to safely
   tap.
    Renal Failure: Prerenal from dehydration vs HRS.  Both GFR and
   potassium have improved with hydration.
     -Creatinine improving still
     -Maintenance fluid today.
   ?GIB:  Some blood in his mouth and per partner some hematemesis
   recently.  No signs of active bleeding, HCT stable.
     -PPI and carafate
     -No plans for endoscopy at present.
    Cirrhosis:
     -Lactulose and rifaximin as above
     -Diuretics on hold in setting of dehydration
    Etoh abuse:  Per prior discharge summaries, has not had episodes of
   DT's in the past although has been drinking more recently
     -CIWA scale unless clear evidence of seizure. Clearly no need for
   benzo's at present.
     -Vitamin Support
   FEN:  Start TF.
