History of Present Illness:
This is a 49 YOM with history of type I DM, HTN, CAD s/p CABG,
and ischemic cardiomyopathy who presents after VFib arrest. Over
the last several weeks has several episodes of dizzy clammy
feelings with normal blood sugars. Has otherwise been healthy
and active. He was at the mall this evening with his wife. [**Name (NI) **]
was feeling fine. He told his wife suddenly that he needed to
sit down. He then quickly passed out, hitting the back of his
head on the ground. Bystanders preformed CPR. When EMS arrived
he was found to be in polymorphic VT. He was shocked at 7pm and
became asystolic. He was given epi/atopine and returned to a
narrow complex rhythm. He was intubated and taken to an OSH. At
the OSH, head CT was reportedly negative. He was started on an
amiodarone dirp and transferred by med flight to [**Hospital1 52**] for
futher care.
.
In our ED, his initial vitals wereHR 103, BP 118/63 satting 100%
on FiO2 100%. He was started on a heparin gtt. He was given
versed for aggitation on the vent and had a CT scan of his c
spine. He also had a 1.5 cm laceration on the back of his head
stapled.
.
Upon arrival to the CCU. Patient was stable. Neuro was consulted
for question of status epilepticus vs myoclonus. A right
subclavian central line and a left A line were placed. He was
started an artic sun cooling blanket at 12am.

.
EKG demonstrated sinus 94 bpm,nl axis and intervals. LVH. TWI V1
, ST depression in V4-6 with no significant change compared with
prior dated [**5-/3494**]
.
TELEMETRY demonstrated:sinus tach
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**5-/3494**] demonstrated:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
mild-to-moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection
fraction 40 percent). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
CXR: large heart. Right subclavian line terminates at SVC. mild
pulmonary edema. No PTX
.
CT c-spine [**4-10**]:  There is no fracture or malalignment within
the cervical spine. The vertebral body and intervertebral disc
space heights are preserved. Mild calcification of the anterior
longitudinal ligament posterior to C2 is degenerative. The
odontoid process approximates well with the anterior arch of C1.
The visualized outline of the thecal sac is unremarkable.
.
Interstitial edema in bilateral lung apices. The visualized
right maxillary sinus is completely opacified, and there is mild
mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus. Mastoid air
cells are clear.
.
MRI/MRA brain [**4-12**]:
There is no slow diffusion to indicate an acute infarct. There
is a left parietal subgaleal hematoma present. The brain
parenchymal signal is normal with no evidence of midline shift
or herniation. There is opacification of all of the paranasal
sinuses which could be due to intubation. The normal vascular
flow voids are present.
.
TTE [**4-14**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed with
inferolateral hypokinesis/akinesis. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.  There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] [**4-17**]:
No signal abnormality is identified within the cervical spinal
cord. Alignment of the vertebral bodies is anatomic. Mild
cervical spondylosis is unchanged.
There remains a small rim of fluid posterior to the anterior
longitudinal ligament between the C2 and C5 levels. The anterior
longitudinal ligament itself appears intact on these images.
Also posterior to the C2 and C3 levels, there is a sliver of
fluid just anterior to the posterior longitudinal ligament; the
ligament itself appears intact. A small amount of fluid is also
seen at the lateral atlantodental joints bilaterally. No soft
tissue abnormalities are appreciated. The visualized cerebellum
and brainstem appear unremarkable.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 49 YOM with known CAD/CM who presents after v fib
arrest.
.
1) CAD/V fib arrest:  Patient collapsed in mall and was found to
be in vfib when EMS arrived.  He received bystander CPR with
estimated time between collapse and EMS arrival of 15 minutes.
Was shocked and became asystolic and then was given epi/atropine
and returned to narrow complex rhythm.  Has h/o CAD s/p 4 vessel
CABG and ischemic cardiomyopathy. EKG done afterwards did not
look ischemic, however may have had acute occlusion of one of
his grafts causing his arrythmia without EKG findings currently.
Had signs of anoxic brain injury on arrival to the CCU including
myoclonus and posturing which are poor prognostic indicators.
Neurology was consulted. He was loaded with IV valproic acid for
sz ppx and placed on versed drip. Given the patient had an
[**Hospital 14199**] hospital arrest and he was within 6 hours of his
arrest the decision was made to treat with therapeutic
hypothermia to reduce cerebral metabolic needs. He was placed on
Vecuronium to reduce shivering during the cooling process. He
was cooled down to 89 degrees for 18 hours per protocol and then
slowly rewarmed.  Given the possibility of an ischemic event he
was placed on IV heparin and continued on ASA.  He had been
started on amiodarone prior to arrival which was stopped due to
prolonged QT interval.  He was continued on BB which was
uptitrated.
.
2) Resp:  Patient was intubated in the field for airway
protection.  Has no history of lung disease.  Was found to have
an aspiration PNA which was treated as below.  During the
hospitalization he did not tolerate his ETT, specifically, when
attempting to wean him off of sedation he would cough violently
and become very agitated.  Given his poor neurologic status and
likely need for prolonged intubation Interventional Pulmonology
was consulted regarding trach placement.  A trach was placed on
[**4-19**].  He continued to have a strong cough despite anesthetics
and cough suppressants.  He was changed to PS ventilation and
tolerated this well and was then weaned to trach mask.  With
improvement in his PNA he was able to be weaned to NC and his
trach was capped.
.
3) DM: Normally on inuslin pump at home. Sugars initially
elevated to 400 with gap acidosis. Likely DKA in setting of
arrest and no insulin pump. Bolused with 1L NS and placed on
insulin gtt. His anion gap resolved and he was maintained on the
insulin gtt for tight glucose control.  [**Last Name (un) 156**] was consulted for
assistance in transition to SC insulin.  Once TFs were
stabilized he was switched to Glargine and RISS.  His
long-acting insulin was uptitrated to 50U to be given at
lunchtime daily.
.
4) Renal insufficency - On admission the patient's Cr was
slightly elevated to 1.3. Etiology was likely poor perfusion in
setting of cardiac arrest. His Cr returned to baseline and
remained stable.
.
5) Fever: Patient developed high fevers on HD#2 up to 102.
Initially felt to be either central fevers vs. infection,
however he then developed bandemia suggestive of acute
infection.  He was pan-cultured.  CXR was consistant with either
aspiration pneumonitis vs. PNA so he was started on ceftriaxone
and flagyl.  Sputum culture grew out pan-sensitive Klebsiella so
his flagyl was discontinued.  He had recurrent fevers a week
into treatment and was recultured.  CXR showed worsening of his
PNA and given the concern for hospital acquired pathogens and
VAP his antibiotics were broadened to vanc/zosyn.  Repeat sputum
culure grew out MSSA and the vanco was discontinued.  All urine
and blood cultures were NGTD. Zosyn, which was started on
[**3497-4-20**], needs to be continued for a total of two weeks.
.
6) FEN: NPO initially given patient was paralyzed.  TFs were
initiated and PEG was placed [**4-19**] for permanant feeding.
.
7) PPX: heparin gtt transiently, then heparin sc, PPI
.
8) Access: R subclavian, left A line
.
9) Code: DNR/I
