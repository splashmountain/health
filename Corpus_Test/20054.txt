Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81-year-old
female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension,
and questionable colon cancer who has been ill for months.

The patient has been having multiple syncopal episodes at
home times months.  They have been unwitnessed.  She
experienced fracture of left arm and right arm during falls.
Earlier this year, worked up at [**Hospital 4294**] Medical Center for
a questionable large gastrointestinal bleed.  A colonoscopy
with multiple polyps; unclear if cancer or not.  Has been
requiring blood transfusions every three months.

In [**3396-8-22**] the patient was admitted to
[**Hospital3 560**] status post fall.  Had delirium and
a 5[**Hospital 14701**] hospital course there.

Last week, she was treated with ciprofloxacin for a urinary
tract infection.  On the night of admission, she was found
passed out on the floor by her nephew who called Emergency
Medical Service.  Found the patient with heart rate of 33 and
a blood pressure of 80/palp.  Taken to [**Hospital 219**] Hospital.  In
the Emergency Department, blood pressure there was 66/palp,
heart rate was 33, respiratory rate was 22, and 97%.  Weight
was 60 kilograms.  Electrocardiogram with questionable
complete heart block.  Was started on dopamine and intubated
for hypotension.  When stabilized, was med-flighted to [**Hospital1 1205**] for further management.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

 1.  HYPOTENSION ISSUES:  The patient was admitted to the
Coronary Care Unit.  Presumably at the time of presentation
we thought that the patient might have been septic as her
numbers were more consistent with a septic physiology as
opposed to a cardiogenic shock physiology.

The patient had an elevated white blood cell count and a left
shift.  She was hypothermic and had evidence of a recent
urinary tract infection for which she was being treated.

However, we could not completely exclude a myocardial
infarction given recent ongoing myocardial infarction;
although less likely.  Other things on our differential that
we were including were adrenal insufficiency and hypothermia
with which she presented.

A sepsis workup was sent off which included blood cultures,
urine cultures, and sputum culture.  The urine culture was
unremarkable.  The sputum culture was unremarkable as well as
blood cultures.  There was one bottle that showed a likely
contaminant.   A chest x-ray showed a left lower lobe
collapse and questionable consolidation.  No evidence of
congestive heart failure; thus bringing the likelihood that
the patient was in cardiogenic shock.

The patient had a triple lumen placed for access and
aggressive intravenous fluid hydration.  The patient was
started on dopamine and later on was changed to Levophed for
blood pressure support.  Despite one pressor, the patient
required pressors for blood pressure support.   Hence, we
added on Neo-Synephrine and vasopressin.  The patient was
covered with broad-spectrum antibiotics; vancomycin,
levofloxacin, and Flagyl with one dose of gentamicin for a
presumed infection.  Cortisol was checked and was
unremarkable.  Metoprolol was held.  The patient was
eventually stabilized on three pressors with an attempt to
wean off pressors and see if the patient would be able to
maintain her own blood pressure.

A conversation with the family was held, and it was their
wishes that the patient not any have further aggressive
measures or attempts of resuscitation such as pacing,
cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or cardioversion.  They did,
in the interim, wish to continue with the intubation and
mechanical support as well as intravenous antibiotics.  The
family brought in the health care proxy, ([**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 31928**])
assigned her son [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 548**] [**Name (NI) 31928**]) as her decision maker.
Despite out continued efforts in attempts to stabilize the
patient and wean off pressors, the patient was not going to
be able to tolerate being off mechanical ventilation or
pressor support.  Per family, the patient was made comfort
measures only and comfortable on a morphine sulfate drip.
The family was at bedside at all times.  The patient expired
on [**3396-11-17**] at 12:08 a.m.  The family declined
autopsy, and the attending was notified.

The patient was admitted to the Unit from an outside hospital
with an external pacemaker, heart beating at 60, and a blood
pressure of 100/60.  Pacing wires were subsequently no longer
needed as the patient's heart rate had returned to a regular
rate without any further need for intervention.  The
patient's family had also declined any further cardiac
measures such as external pacing.

 2.  HYPOTHERMIA ISSUES:  Likely secondary to sepsis.  We
were unable to record any rectal temperatures.  The patient
was started on a warming blanket and concurrent antibiotics;
vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl with one dose of
gentamicin to treat the possible sepsis.  Cortisol was
unremarkable.  On the second day of her admission,
temperature was improved.

 3.  BRADYCARDIA ISSUES:  At outside hospital, the patient
was recorded as having sinus bradycardia up to 33.  On
admission, her bradycardia has resolved, and she had a
regular rate.  Most likely secondary to ischemia and
consequent hypothermia.

 4.  NON-ST-ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION ISSUES:  It was
likely that the patient had a non-ST-elevation myocardial
infarction secondary to demand given her hypotension.
Unlikely acute coronary syndrome.  Heparin was held, and the
patient was given supportive measures such a blood pressure
support on three pressors; Levophed, Neo-Synephrine, and
vasopressin.

Given the patient's elevated cardiac enzymes with a troponin
of 0.15 in the setting of renal insufficiency, the troponin
leak was attributed to demand ischemia and not acute coronary
syndrome.

 5.  CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY ISSUES:  The patient's
baseline creatinine was unknown, but chronic renal
insufficiency may have been attributed to hypotension or
rheumatoid arthritis.  Her electrolytes were followed on a
daily basis, and medications were renally dosed.

 6.  ANEMIA ISSUES:  The patient's hematocrit was followed on
a daily basis.  Her hematocrit dropped secondary to large
intravenous fluid hydration and volume given.  No evidence of
acute blood loss noted on examination.  The patient was
stable.

 7.  SEIZURE ISSUES:  The patient had an episode of seizure.
Her blood sugar was checked and noted to be 37.  One ampule
of dextrose 50 was administered and consequent Dilantin
loading was also done.  The patient's seizure activity
resolved, and no further seizure activity was noted
throughout the remainder of her stay.  Likely etiology was
hypoglycemic seizure.

 8.  PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  The patient was maintained on
heparin subcutaneously.

 9.  CODE STATUS ISSUES:  The patient was made do not
resuscitate/do not intubate and subsequently comfort measures
only.

10.  ACCESS ISSUES:  The patient had a right internal jugular
and left arterial line placed on [**11-15**].
