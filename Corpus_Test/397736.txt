Cardiology Consult
   Asked by MICU team to consult on this complex 69f to assist with
   hemodynamic management.
   HPI
   69f admitted [**6-16**] from nursing home through [**Hospital1 5**] ER.  Her recent
   history is notable for severe PVD s/p [**Name (NI) **] CFA
 PT bypass on [**3302-4-18**],
   wound infections & revisions, most recently [**6-12**].  Discharged to rehab
   on [**6-15**], but immediately bounced back with mental status changes,
   hypotension, hypoxemia, and rapid atrial fibrillation.  She was
   intubated in the emergency room and admitted to the MICU.
   Echo as below; CT-Angiogram showed RML arterial filling defect, ?
   chronic PE, R subclavian artery occlusion, recurrent invasive lung
   cancer.
   Her course here has been notable for labile hemodynamics, seemingly
   worse when extubated and improving when re-intubated (as happened
   yesterday), after her extubation course degenerated with confusion,
   unrepsonsiveness, and hyptonsion requiring dopamine and levophed..
   No clear infectious etiology for her decompensation yet identified,
   though broadly covered.
   Currently intubated, unable to obtain a cardiac or general review of
   systems.  Family reports that the patient has no known history of CAD,
   do not think she has had ETT or cath previously.
   PMH
H/o lung cancer w/prior RLLectomy; recent imaging suggestive of recurrent metast
atic disease.
PAD as above
T2DM
Tyroid disease s/p thyroidectomy
H/o orthostatic hypotension, on midodrine/florinef as outpatient
   Echo ([**6-16**])
 Limited study with biventricular dysfunction, LVEF 30%,
   RV dysfunction/dilation, 2+ MR, [**2-28**]+ TR, no effusion
   Telemetry
 SR, 80s.
   ECG
 (From [**6-17**])
 SR, borderline volts, diffuse nonspecific ST-TW
   changes with some suggestion of RV strain.
   Meds
   Vanco/ceftax/zosyn
   Versed/fentanyl
   UFH at 600u/hr
   Bowel meds
   Dig 0.0625
   Thyroid replacement
   PPI
   ** Not on midodrine or florinef, though was on these upon discharge
   Laboratory data as per OMR.
   Exam
   Afebrile     HR  80s               BP 85/55 100 02 on Fi02 40%
   HEENT unremarkable
   JVP up to jaw
   Lungs with decreased b/l bs
   RR, soft systolic murmur at base
   Abdomen soft, NT/ND
   Mild edema in lower and upper extremities
   Impression
   Complex 69f with PAD s/p [**Month/Year (2) **] bypass, admitted with respiratory failure
   and hypotension.  We are asked to comment on her described hemodynamic
   lability post extubation, and whether any primary cardiac pathology may
   be complicating her picture and/or limiting her liberation from the
   ventilator.
   Her ER TTE demonstrated new biventricular dysfunction and worsening MR
   and TR; however, this was an incomplete study performed in the throes
   of acute illness, and may not reflect her current cardiac status.
   Notably, her CV02s (albeit from a leg line) are if anything high, and
   her oxygenation has been reasonable.  This would argue against a
   significant cardiogenic component to her hypotension.  Her exam now
   seems more consistent with low-grade systemic inflammation than
   congestive heart failure.
   A PA-catheter may better characterize her filling pressures, although
   we would be reluctant to pursue an invasive procedure in someone with
   an overall very guarded prognosis.  A noninvasive instrument such as
   the Vigileo device may be helpful.
   Recommendations
   Restart midodrine and florinef (as she was on these as an outpatient)
   and wean levophed based on baseline hypotension
   If still intubated on Tuesday, re-check TTE
   Consider PA-catheter vs noninvasive CO/CI monitor

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] from [**3302-6-16**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Patient with hypoventilation and hypotension periextubation.  While
   there is some component of cardiovascular inefficiency, I beleive that
   many parameters support the idea that vasodilation is a large component
   of tissue hypoperfusion and the hypoventilation is not due to
   cardiovascular compromise.  The fact that profound pulmonary edema is
   not present and there is suggestion that mixed venous O2 may be high
   are significant factors that I am considering.  I think the new wall
   motion abnormalities on ECHO will ultimately prove to be transient
   reactions to severe compromise and tissue level perfusion rather than
   primary processes in and of themseleves.  As such, I would suggest
   management to include return to medications as an outpatient that were
   given to replace poor vasomotor tone as described by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
