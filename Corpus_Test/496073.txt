   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**7-16**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2603-8-22**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now s/p
   tracheostomy, now with PNA and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions: Patient
   intubated [**8-22**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, Now
   with trach [**8-30**], on trach mask until [**9-5**], back on vent for hypercarbic
   resp failure in setting of RUL PNA.
   s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5489**])
   IP removed L pigtail, Rt removed [**9-3**].
   R pleural fluid with GPC, pH >8; previously sent fluid showed
   acinetobacter.  likely colonization
   - Thoracentesis on [**9-9**].5L removed. Patient has resultant basalar
   pneumothorax, on fio100%, getting frequent CXR.
   - remained on PS 5/5, will continue
   - Linezolid (day 1 [**9-4**], switched from daptomycin [**Date range (1) 5764**])
   - Unasyn to cover acinetobacter. Day 1: [**9-8**]. for 8 day course
   - Discontinue Meroponem for Klebsiella in pleural fluid: (day 1 [**9-5**]) ,
   - on lasix. Will make goal -500 to 1L. Completed acetazolamide doses.
   - repeat ABG or VBGs today
    Anemia: Hct has been trending down, received 1 unit PRBs [**2603-9-5**].
   ordered 1 unit PRBCs [**9-9**] for hct of 19, bumped appropriately to 26
   - transfuse for <21. Blood instead of NS for bolus
   - Recheck HCT today.
    Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body
   fluid overloaded, on lasix gtt
   - I/O -.5-1 L.  putting out well with drip.
   - lasix gtt
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **]
     Eosinophilia: Last checked was 23% - 2760 absolute
   - f/u strongloydes
 still pending
     PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically.
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - Neurontin for pain control, will titrate down to 200mg TID.
   - Heprin gtt discontinue for oozing.
    CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - decrease metoprolol to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], hold for SBP <95.
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
    Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is 50mg PO TID):
   titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
 discontinue for oozing from coccyx
   - required 2.5mg metoprolol intermittently for tachycardia while on
   lower dose PO metoprolol.
    Hypothyroidism: Had been followed Endocrine, appreciate recs,
   Endocrine signing off, call with questions
   - IV levothyroxine while on continuous feeds, Once on bolus feeds, can
   switch to 75 mcg PO daily
   -  TFTs today wnl
   Lt>Rt arm swelling: likely related to PICC line, on heparin, so clot is
   low prob. Negative ultrasound.
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status. Will try to optimize with tube
   feeds and treatment of infections. Should ultimately get a PEG.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - Consider PEG as soon as possible, but TF via NGT for now
   Communication: Wife [**Name (NI) **] (HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5481**]
 family meeting [**8-26**]:
   want aggressive management currently. want trach and peg. Prefer
   Meeting over the phone.
