   Assessment and Plan
   70 F with HTN, HL presenting with pleuritic shoulder pain, presyncope,
   nausea, found to have a pericardial effusion with tamponade.
   .
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION:  Infectious or malignant causes seem most likely,
   as these are the most common sources of pericardial effustion and she
   has no history of radiation, renal failur or collagen vascular
   disease.  Her family history of breast and ovarian cancer increase the
   concern for malignant cause, however the acute onset and history of a
   few weeks of fevers and elevated WBC would favor infectious etiology.
   It is also possible that her recent episode of AF was related to
   myocardial ischemia and that this represents a Dressler's syndrome, but
   this seems less likely.
   - Repeat echo in the morning to assess for resolution of effusion.
   - Follow cultures, will add on viral cultures and cytology if possible.
   - Will d/c drain once output decreased and effusion resolved.
   - regarding malignancy workup, she is due for outpatient f/u to eval
   for heme positive stools and needs a followup CT for resolution of
   pulmonary nodules observed on last admission.
   .
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Currently rate controlled with atenolol.
   - metoprolol while inpatient
   - anticoagulation would be contraindicated presently, hold ASA
   .
   ELEVATED LFTS: These are new from previosly normal values on last
   admission and likely represent congestion from RV failure.  This could
   also be related to infection or medciations.  There were no concerning
   findings on abdominal ultrasound and she is not jaundiced on exam.
   - will trend LFTs and expect resolution
   .
   HYPERTENSION: Will hold lisinopril and HCTZ given tamponade physiology
   and restart as needed.
   .
   DEPRESSION: Continue Paxil
   .
   FEN:
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -Holding DVT ppx for now given bleeding risk.
   -Pain managment with tylenol as needed
   -Bowel regimen of colase/senna
