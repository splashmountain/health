HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58 year old male with
a very complicated previous medical history who was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 170**] on
[**3137-5-5**], from [**Hospital 118**] Rehabilitation for increasing
lethargy, low grade temperatures and hypoxia.  He had been in
prior to admission.  He was noted to have increasing lethargy
over the few days and then on the day of admission his oxygen
saturation decreased to the low 80% on his baseline four
liters of oxygen.  He had a low grade temperature.  Notably
he had had a PICC line placed recently.  Arterial blood gases
at [**Hospital1 118**] showed pH 7.05, pCO2 76 and FIO2 95.  The FIO2 is
unknown on the sample.  He was transferred to the [**Hospital3 **]
only of feeling weak and of feeling very tired. He was
disoriented.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  AIDS diagnosed in [**3128**].  Only opportunistic infection is
apparently Candidal esophagitis.  He also has severe
cardiomyopathy secondary to HIV.  His ejection fractions have
been variously recorded at 30 to 40% and then 70% on a most
recent echocardiogram.  He has severe right ventricular
dilation and hypokinesis.
2.  End stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on four liters home
oxygen.
4.  Pulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis in [**3127**].
5.  Hepatitis B.
6.  Hepatitis C.
7.  Sustained ventricular tachycardia, status post ablation
in [**3137-1-19**].
8.  Pneumonia, some with Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus, one requiring intubation
9.  Pancreatitis.
10. PPD positive.
11. VRE positive.
12. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive.
13. History of intravenous drug use, on Methadone.
14. Question of history of obstructive sleep apnea.

ALLERGIES:  Thorazine causes anaphylaxis, H2 blockers cause
thrombocytopenia.  Haldol, Clindamycin, Codeine and Stelazine
all cause rashes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of admission to the
Medicine Intensive Care Unit, the patient is comfortable,
sleeping, but arousible, cachectic man.  Temperature was
97.4, blood pressure 112/48, pulse 99, respiratory rate 12,
oxygen saturation 96% on 50% face mask. The pupils were 4.0
millimeters bilaterally and reactive.  There is no jugular
venous distention.  He had crackles at his lung bases. His
heart was regular.  He had a II/VI systolic ejection murmur
at the left upper sternal border.  His abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.  Liver
edge was one to two centimeters below the costal margin.
There was no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  He did not
cooperate with neurologic examination but moved all four
extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  At the time of admission, laboratories were
notable for a white count 4.4 without a left shift,
hematocrit 43.9 and platelets 87,000.  His Chem7 was 135,
potassium 7.8, chloride 102, bicarbonate 15, blood urea
nitrogen 64, creatinine 7.2 with a glucose of 95.  Arterial
blood gases on two liters showed pH 7.09, pCO2 57 and pO2 60.

Electrocardiogram had slightly peaked T waves in the lateral
leads which was unchanged from baseline.  Chest x-ray showed
mild pulmonary edema but no infiltrates.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The impression at the time of arrival to
the Emergency Department was that this was a 58 year old man
with complicated medical history presenting with acidosis,
hyperkalemia, and lethargy.  He was treated with insulin,
glucose, Kayexalate and taken to emergent hemodialysis.  At
that time, he complained only of dyspnea and fatigue with a
question of increase in his sputum production.  He was then
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and was also
placed on bilevel positive airway pressure and he should
receive Vancomycin, Gentamicin and Levofloxacin, but these
were discontinued after only one dose.  Cultures are negative
to date.

He improved rapidly with dialysis and BiPAP and his
antibiotics were discontinued.  The pulmonary critical care
team's overall impression was fluid overload versus
bronchitis and felt that a possible left lower lobe process
noted on chest x-ray was not pneumonia.  His temperature
maximum during this hospitalization was 99.9.  On [**3137-5-8**],
he was felt ready for transfer back to [**Hospital1 118**], however, a
bed was not available and he was transferred to the floor.
He complained only of feeling very weak (diffusely) but said
that his breathing was improved about 50 to 60% of the way
back to baseline.  A repeat chest x-ray showed improvement in
the pulmonary edema.  It showed no infiltrate.

At this time, his date of discharge is not clear.  An induced
sputum for pneumocystis will be sent prior to discharge.
However, it is felt clinically low probability that
pneumocystis is involved in this presentation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Profound metabolic acidosis, etiology unclear.
2.  Concurrent respiratory acidosis.
3.  Hyperkalemia secondary to acidosis.
4.  Mental status changes secondary to multiple metabolic
abnormalities, improved.
5.  Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
6.  End stage renal disease, on hemodialysis.
7.  HIV/AIDS.
8.  Cardiomyopathy.
