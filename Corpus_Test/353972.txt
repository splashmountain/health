Chief Complaint:  respiratory distress
   HPI:
   Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 68 y/o man with PMH notable for COPD, ESRD on
   hemodialysis, and h/o chronic diastolic CHF who presented to [**Hospital1 **]
   [**Location (un) 1375**] with increased dyspnea. She notes worsening dyspnea nearly
   every afternoon; yesterday, her symptoms progressed and she "felt like
   she was going to die." She called EMS and was transported to [**Hospital1 **]
   [**Location (un) 1375**]. She received 100 mg IV lasix en route. On arrival to the [**Hospital1 **]
   [**Location (un) 1375**] ER, the patient's vitals were BP 256/99, HR 115, RR 30, 84%
   (?oxygen) --> 90% on 100%NRB. CXR showed pulmonary edema. Blood
   pressures quickly improved on nitro gtt to 130s-140s systolic. She was
   placed on BIPAP with symptomatic improvement; she was also treated with
   a nebulizer due to wheezing. Of note, BNP elevated to > 11,000 at
   [**Location (un) 1375**]. Due to inability to obtain timely dialysis, she was
   transferred to [**Hospital1 52**].
   .
   In the [**Hospital1 52**] ED, her vitals were HR 92, BP 138/103 (on nitro gtt), RR
   22, 99% on CPAP. She was transitioned to NRB with sats remaining 100%.
   .
   On arrival to the MICU, the patient reports thirst and wants to have
   ginger ale. She denies any chest pain. Her breathing is improved per
   her report. She denies missing any medications or any dialysis
   sessions. She has not increased salt intake in her diet per her report.
   She reports increased orthopnea at home (baseline 3.5 pillows & sleeps
   on side). She denies any chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, or
   lightheadedness. She denies any abdominal pain but endorses some
   constipation. She denies any dysuria. She has recently had symptoms of
   a URI (fever/nasal congestion/cough) but has finished a recent course
   of azithromycin with improved symptoms.

   .
   UA: [**12-28**] rbcs, 5-10 wbcs, [**12-28**] epis, innumerable bacteria
   Imaging: CXR ([**Location (un) **]): There are changes of acute congestive failure
   which now are more prominent as compared with the previous examination
   from [**3166-10-12**]. There is general increased density on both lung bases
   with prominence of the interstitial markings.  There are no definite
   acute parenchymal infiltrates.  The indwelling central catheter with
   tip at the junction between superior vena cava and the right atrium has
   unchanged appearance. IMPRESSION: ACUTE CONGESTIVE FAILURE WITH EDEMA.
   .
   Echo ([**3166-11-10**]):  The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
   elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
   increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The number of
   aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve
   stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are moderately thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There
   is no pericardial effusion. MPRESSION: Techinically difficult study.
   Overall left ventricular and right ventricular systolic functions are
   normal. No gross valvular abnormalities noted. Pulmonary pressures
   could not be assessed due to inadequate TR jet. Compared to the
   previous echo on [**3164-10-21**] ( images not available for review) LV
   function has improved and moderate mitral regurgiation is not noted.
   .
   Persantine MIBI ([**5-30**]): The patient is a 67 yo female with a history of
   CAD s/p LCX, LAD stents, CRI, DMII, CHF EF 45-50% referred for
   shortness of breath, CAD evaluation. The patient received 0.142
   mg/kg/min of persantine over 4 minutes. The patient did not report any
   chest, arm, neck, or back discomfort with peak infusion or recovery.
   EKG showed sinus rhythm with rare VPBs. There were no ischemic ST-T
   wave changes. The patient received 125 mg IV aminophylline to reverse
   persantine. Hemodynamic response to persantine was appropriate.
   IMPRESSION: No ischemic ST-T wave changes or anginal-type symptoms.
   Nuclear report: Left ventricular cavity size is normal. Rest and stress
   perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the left
   ventricular myocardium. Gated images reveal normal wall motion. The
   calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 54%. IMPRESSION:
   Normal study; LVEF 54%.
   .
   Cardiac cath ([**9-29**]): 1.  Selective coronary angiography in this right
   dominant patient revealed single vessel CAD.  The LMCA was
   angiographically normal.  The previously placed LCX stents were patent
   with mild narrowing proximal and distal to them.  The LAD had a
   mid-proximal 80% hazy lesion just prior to a large diagonal.  The RCA
   was a previously dominant vessel that was diffusely diseased and
   occluded proximally. The PDA filled via collaterals from the left.
   2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevation of left and right sided
   filling pressures with RA of 11mmHg and wedge of 26mmHG.  There was
   mild pulmonary hypertension.  The cardiac output was high normal due to
   anemia.  The systemic blood pressure was normotensive. 3. The lesion in
   the LAD was predilated with a 2.0 mm then a 2.5 mm balloon, stented
   with a 2.5 mm X 23 mm cypher stent and post dilated with a 2.75 mm
   balloon with lesion reduction from 80 to 0%. The final
   angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis, no dissection
   and no embolisation. (see PTCA comments)
   ECG: ekg: sinus rhythm at 80, normal axis, inverted p wvae in v1, no
   ischemic st changes, t wave flattening in v1 (similar to prior) and v2,
   q wave in iii (old)
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 68 y/o woman with PMH notable for ESRD on HD, chronic
   diastolic CHF, and coronary artery disease admitted to MICU with
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patient hypertensive on arrival to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 1375**]
   and CXR & labs compatible with acute on chronic diastolic congestive
   heart failure. BNP also elevated at OSH. Unclear precipitant as cannot
   determine if hypertension the cause of her symptoms or a reaction to
   respiratory distress. Now much improved-on nasal cannula, not
   hypertensive off of nitro gtt.
   - dialysis planned for today
   - nitro gtt now off, give usual BP meds
   - closely monitor blood pressures
   - continue supplemental oxygen to keep O2 > 92%
   - continue nebs prn
   - continue advair
   - no clear indication for pneumonia treatment at this time
   - continue po lasix on non-HD days per usual routine
   - check 3rd set CEs this evening to rule out for MI though no changes
   on EKG
   .
   # Hypertension: As above, already weaned off of nitro gtt with
   subsequent BP 120s/40s. Plan to resume usual home meds and continue to
   monitor.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: ? related to UTI. Plan cipro X 3 day course. Follow
   culture. No clear pulmonary infiltrate on CXR.
   - add on urine culture
   - cipro x 3 days
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Renal fellow contact[**Name (NI) **] from the [**Name (NI) **], plan for dialysis
   today.
   - Appreciate renal input
   - lyte management per HD, repeat lytes after dialysis
   - Dialysis today for volume removal
   - continue sevelamer, sensipar, nephrocaps
   .
   # CAD s/p stenting: Continue statin, aspirin, plavix, ACEi and beta
   blocker per home regimen. Continue tid nitrate as per home regimen. Has
   recent echo (see above).
   .
   # h/o HD-cath associated DVT: Continue coumadin, goal INR [**12-26**].
   .
   # h/o COPD: Continue singulair, advair. Supplemental O2 as above.
   Continue albuterol nebs prn.
   .
   # Insulin dependent DM: Continue lantus with sliding scale. Plan to
   give 1/2 dose lantus when NPO.
   - fingersticks four times daily
   - lantus with sliding scale humalog
   .
   # Gout: allopurinol after HD per usual routine.
   .
   # FEN: diabetic, low salt cardiac diet; lytes per HD
   .
   # PPx: INR 2.6 today at [**Location (un) 1375**], ppi per home regimen, bowel meds prn
   .
   # CODE: full, confirmed with patient, does not want central line but
   would like to readdress if situation arises.
   .
   # Access: 2 18 g PIVs
   .
   # COMM: with patient and husband, [**Name (NI) 6550**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7021**]
