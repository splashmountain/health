TITLE:
   PROCEDURE NOTE
   Insertion of RIJ central line was attempted with USS guidance. 2
   attempts were made. Both times, RIJ was easily punctured on first pass
   with good venous flow. However, both times, guide wire could not be
   inserted because of patient
s use of accessory muscles of respiration
   compressing the vein, and because of bend in the RIJ path. Use of a
   more flexible guidewire failed. Procedure was abandoned and converted
   to a R femoral vein triple lumen line. Using USS, vein was easily
   punctured on first pass with good flows. No apparent complications. CXR
   to r/o pneumothorax was ordered. RIJ access was first attempted by Dr
   [**Last Name (STitle) 2352**] under my supervision. Subsequent attempts by myself.
