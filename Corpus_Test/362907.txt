   Assessment and Plan
   56 yoM w/ h/o EtOH cirrhosis; admitted after being found this morning
   unrepsonsive in bed by roommate, in setting of possible EtOH withdrawal
   and two weeks of reported hematemesis.
   #. ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 initial insult likely HE, then exacerbated
   by inability to clear Ativan. Now mental status clearing nicely,
   patient is much more alert. Tolerating PO
   -- cont lactulose (and rifaximin) given HE is most likely diagnosis
   --continue aspiration precautions, advance diet carefully and with
   supervision
   --encourage PO intake
   # HYPERCHLOREMIA: patient likely continues to be dehydrated. Will
   switch to D5
 NS today and encourage PO intake.
   #. UGIB: patient has history of UGIB; has been scoped in past, no
   evidence of bleed; c/f portal gastropathy. Report of hematemesis is
   unconfirmed, patient had blood on his teeth only. Baseline Hct unclear,
   has been stable.
   -- maintain active T&S
   -- PPI IV BID; sucralfate
   -- liver recs
 will likely scope
   #. ARF: Likely pre-renal, resolved with IVF.
   -- cont IVF boluses today until PO intake adequate
   -- will hold lisinopril 20 mg QD and lasix 40 mg QD (home meds)
   #. ALCOHOLIC HEPATITIS: AST:ALT > 2:1, elevated above baseline (AST
   normally runs low 100's or less); concern for acute alcoholic hepatitis
   on top of alcoholic cirrhosis.  Could not visualize portal vein on RUQ
   US. Could also have some element of congestive hepatopathy.
   -- f/u liver recs
   -- cont lactulose/rifaximin
   #. ELEVATED LIPASE: has h/o elevated lipase with prior episodes of poor
   PO intake and emesis.  Pt was c/o abd pain prior to being found
   unrepsonsive.
   -- cont to trend
   #. H/O ETOH ABUSE: last drink on [**12-11**]; drinks 1 bottle of wine per
   night.  C/f increased ingestion recently.  Gave banana bag.
   -- no need for CIWA currently
   -- will place s/w consult today
   #. HYPERLIPIDEMIA:
   -- will hold home simvastatin given acute elevation in LFT's
   #. NUTRITION: ADAT with aspiration precautions
