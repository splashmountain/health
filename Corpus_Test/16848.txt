Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Type A dissection.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Type A dissection.

PROCEDURES PERFORMED:
1.  Repair of type A dissection with supracoronary hemiarch
II graft 28 mm and resuspension of the aortic valve on
[**2618-12-4**].
2.  Percutaneous tracheostomy placement.
3.  Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
4.  Hemodialysis catheter placement.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50-year-old
male with a past medical history significant for hypertension
who was transferred to [**Hospital6 656**]
after he presented to an outside hospital with weakness in
his lower extremities.  The patient fell, and upon evaluation
was found to have a type A aortic dissection.  The patient
was transferred to [**Hospital6 656**], was
found to be in shock.  A TE was done which revealed an aortic
dissection as well as an aortic insufficiency.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  NEUROLOGY:  The patient had a complicated
postoperative neurologic course.  He had decreased function
of his bilateral lower extremities postoperatively.  This was
thought to be secondary to spinal cord ischemia; the
patient's spinal arteries were most likely involved in his
abdominal resection which was not repaired.

On [**2619-1-12**], the patient underwent a CT of his head
which was negative.  On [**2619-1-13**], he underwent an EEG
as he was having what were thought to be seizures.  The EEG
was essentially negative.  It was then decided that given
what was thought to be seizure activity while positioning the
patient in a sitting position, that this was actually a
reaction to postural hypotension.

The patient also underwent an MRI of his TL spine on [**2619-1-15**] which was negative as well.  The patient was
initially intubated for many weeks and was confused.  After
approximately one month in the ICU, he began to wake up and
regain his normal mental status.  He worked with PT and did
regain some motion of his lower extremities.

On [**2619-1-20**], he underwent an MRI/MRA of his brain
which revealed linear focus in his left cerebellar hemisphere
of late subacute chronic hemorrhage.  This was not thought to
be acute in nature but given the patient's anticoagulation on
heparin and Coumadin.  Neurology was reconsulted.  At the
time of dictation, there was no further recommendations.

At the patient's time of discharge, he was fully awake,
alert, conversant, and appropriate with some motor function
in his bilateral lower extremities.

CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had somewhat of a labile
postoperative cardiovascular course as his blood pressure was
rather labile.  He was at first maintained on a Nipride drip
to keep his blood pressure under tight control given his
hemiarch II graft repair.  Gradually, the patient was
transitioned over to p.o. antihypertensives; Lopressor and
Labetalol were used, and slowly he was transitioned over to
p.o. Lopressor which controlled the patient's blood pressure
and heart rate.  He had no other cardiovascular issues
throughout his hospital course.  On discharge, he was on 150
mg of Lopressor b.i.d.  Of note, this may be changed and an
addendum will be dictated if there is a change in his
medications at discharge.

Of note, the patient underwent a TE on [**2619-1-5**] which
revealed a normal EF and no vegetations.  This was done for
concern of the patient's spiking of temperatures.  He also
underwent an MRI of his chest on [**2619-1-14**] which
showed some old blood in the mediastinum; however, this was
thought to be consistent with postoperative changes.

RESPIRATORY:  The patient underwent a percutaneous
tracheostomy on [**2618-12-18**] because of his failure to
wean from the ventilator.  His respiratory course was
somewhat prolonged and arduous as well.  He had bouts of
tachypnea and failure to wean from the ventilator.

On [**2618-12-31**], he underwent a CTA because of his hypoxia
which revealed bilateral pulmonary emboli.  He was started on
a heparin drip and Coumadin was begun on [**2619-1-13**].
The patient slowly weaned from the ventilator and was
tolerating room air.

On [**2619-1-16**], the tracheostomy was discontinued and
the patient was able to vocalize without problems.  His
saturations were 95-100 on room air.

RENAL:  Postoperatively, the patient had severely elevated
CKs in the range of 44,000.  He went into acute renal
failure.  This was thought to be secondary to the involvement
of his renal arteries and his abdominal aortic dissection.

Renal consult was obtained and ultimately the patient was
placed on hemodialysis for oliguria, rising creatinine, and
potassium.  Slowly, the patient began to have minimal urine
output and on [**2619-1-8**] hemodialysis was discontinued
as the patient was making large amounts of urine on his own
and his creatinine ultimately did normalize.  He had no
further renal issues towards the end of his hospital stay.

GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient received a percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy on [**2618-12-25**] given his prolonged
hospital course.  He did tolerate tube feeds but given the
fact that he progressed well and was able to vocalize and his
tracheostomy was removed, a bedside swallow evaluation was
done which he passed and he was started on liquids.

The patient also underwent a barium swallow given his vagal
episodes.  This was normal.  On discharge, the patient was
tolerating a regular diet.  Also, of note, the patient
underwent an abdominal CT on [**2618-12-31**] as he had some
slight abdominal pain.  This was negative.  On [**2619-1-14**], he underwent a right upper quadrant ultrasound looking
for a source for his persistent fevers.  This was negative as
well.

HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused several times
throughout his hospital course.  Given his bilateral
pulmonary embolism, he was started on a heparin drip on
[**2618-12-31**] and was transitioned over to Coumadin on
[**2619-1-13**] as it was deemed that he would not need a
permanent hemodialysis catheter and would not need further
operative intervention.  His goal INR was to be approximately
2.

VASCULAR:  Initially the patient was followed by the Vascular
Surgery Team as there was concern that his lower extremities
were ischemic secondary to an area extended to his iliacs
bilaterally.  The patient's feet remained warm with
Dopplerable signals.

A discussion was had regarding repair of his abdominal aortic
aneurysm.  However, given his tenuous clinical status and the
fact that he was beginning to progress it was decided not to
repair this aneurysm or to bypass his lower extremities.

ENDOCRINE:  The patient was initially on an insulin drip
changed over to a sliding scale.  This was gradually
withdrawn.  The patient underwent a cortisol stim test as a
workup for his fevers.  This was negative as well.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was persistently febrile
throughout his hospital course spiking on almost a daily
basis.  He was started on vancomycin for coagulase-negative
Staphylococcus on his right IJ catheter tip and he was also
started on Zosyn for gram-negative rods in his sputum.

He then grew out Pseudomonas in his urine which was resistant
to everything except Imipenem.  He was switched to vancomycin
and Imipenem.  Antibiotics were then discontinued as he began
to have a rash over his whole entire body and Infectious
Disease was concerned that this was a drug-related reaction.
His rash did improve somewhat.

Given the concern for infection of his graft, Cardiothoracic
Surgery strongly urged to continue antibiotics given the fact
that the patient had a rising white count to 22,000 and
continued to spike fevers.  The patient was started on Cipro
and Zosyn for Pseudomonas in his sputum and urine.  The
patient grew out
