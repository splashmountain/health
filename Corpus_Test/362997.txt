   ABG: 7.40 / 36 / 83 /  / -1   Values as of [**3067-2-26**] 03:44 AM
   Assessment and Plan
   39M w/ PMhx of Ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve reconstruction,
   right and left sided systolic congestive heart failure, presenting with
   unstable ventricular tachycardia, s/p resuscitation with return to
   sinus tachycardia, now intubated, with hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Likely result of scarring from ebstein
   anomaly/repairs. Currently receiving amiodarone IV, remains in sinus
   tachycardia s/p resuscitation.  Cardiac enzymes mildly elevated, likely
   related to CPR and cardioversion. AM 1/26 episodes of SVT with rate in
   120s to 130s, improved with amio bolus x 2 and lido gtt, now off lido.
   -likely need VT albation
   -continue amiodarone gtt for now, but careful monitoring of LFTs
   -electrophysiology consult
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial origin possibling include
   low cardiac output, volume overload, aspiration PNA, sepsis. No shunt
   seen on TEE bubble study. Difficulty oxygenating until addition of
   nitric oxide on [**2-25**], now on Fi02 70% and PEEP of 20. PE ruled out with
   CTA. CT initially showed left pneumothorax, but f/u CT showed
   resolution after chest tube attempt. Also CT and CXRs showing
   right-sided possible aspiration PNA, which is consistent w/ reported
   aspiration during intubation. Being ventilated according to ARDS net
   protocol.
   -pulm recs to stop paralytic- Nimbex, decrease FIO2 to 60%, and start
   weaning nitric oxide
   -continuing lasix gtt, improved UO
   -ARDS net protocol
   -nebs
   - [**Hospital1 **] CXR to eval for PTX
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially secondary to ventricular tachycardia, and
   response to sedatives s/p intubation. Initially on three pressors but
   now only on levophed and vasopressin.  Will try to minimize PEEP to
   maximize venous return. Likely due to both cardiogenic and septic
   shock.
   - Pressors as needed
   - Fluids as neded, but currently on lasix gtt for volume overload
   - consider Swan-Ganz placement to evaluate pressures/volumes
   .
   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis/fever/right lobe infiltrate- likely aspiration
   PNA, witnessed emesis during intubation. Continued to be febrile
   overnight and this morning. Vanco level was low, dose increased
   - MRSA screen and precautions
   - Continue vanco and zosyn, day 3 on
   - Following vanco levels
   - follow sputum, urine, and blood cxs
   .
   # Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: Has right and left sided
   heart failure, s/p tricuspid reconstruction and ASD repair. Will hold
   metoprolol, lisinopril, lasix, and digoxin in setting of hypotension.
   - hold metoprolol, lisinopril, digoxin
   - TEE and TTE
 showed poor systolic function, EF not estimated
   - consider diurese w lasix drip to goal -500 cc / 24 hours
   .
   # ARF: Cr increased to 3.2. Likely [**3-4**] hypotension. Prerenal by urine
   lytes. UO now improved
   - monitor UOP
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Transaminitis: LFTs increased to 1000s, likely from shock liver, and
   CHF. Also has abdominal extension.
   - monitor liver function
   - may need to stop amio
   - AXR done on [**2-25**]- no free air, no obstruction seen (wet read)
   .
   # Family dynamics: family concerned about care of pt in the hospital,
   mother wants transfer to [**Name (NI) 48**],
   - social work consult
   - patient relations/advocate consults
   - Children
s congenital specialist contact[**Name (NI) **]- no other recs
   .
   #Gout: holding allopurinol and colchicine
   .
   FEN:  NPO
   ACCESS: right femoral line
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots, sub q heparin
   - bowel regimen (Colace, Pantoprazole)
