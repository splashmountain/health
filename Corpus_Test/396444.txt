   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo male with a day of n/v and diarrhea and drop in his HCT with
   hypotension (systolics to 88mmHg) in the ED and report of guiac + and
   NG lavage + for blood with new onset acute on chronic renal failure .
   Notably BP improved with fluid bolus.
   >Hypotension / anemia: seems that a GI source is probable given new
   anemia ? UGI with ulcer, gastritis (no EtOH hx),
   MW tear in setting of recent nausea (? Underlying gastroenteritis as
   source) or alternatively with lower GI source given hx of adenomas.
   Reponded well to fluid bolus. Appreciate GI input
   - Type and cross
   -  Serial Hct
   - 2 18 G PIV
   - IVF at 125 cc /hr with LR
   - GI for EGD +/- [**Last Name (un) **] in AM
   > Nausea/vomiting: ? gastroenteritis (viral vs food contamination).  ?
   gallbladder/liver/pancreatic source
   - check LFTs and lactate
   -check pancreatic enzymes
   - if teting abnl consider imaging (US vs CT scan).
   > Renal failure: acute on chronic with likely pre-renal component in
   the setting of recent hydration. Will fluid resuscitate and recheck
   renal function in AM
   >HTN: hold anti-htn
s for now given hypotension
