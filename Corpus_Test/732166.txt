   Blood cultures since [**4-4**] NGTD
   [**3-31**], [**4-2**], [**4-3**] blood cx C albicans fluconazole sensitive
   CXR clear lung fields, L HD catheter and ET tube in good position
   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo F with ESRD on HD, HBV, recent prolonged hospitalization for PEG
   c/b abdominal abscess requiring debridement along with gram negative
   bacteremia and candidemia readmitted with C.difficile colitis and found
   to have new candidemia with [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans with episode of
   bradycardia/hypotensive/unresponsive episode yesterday.
   .
   # Unresponsive episode
   Patient had similar episode on floor prompting her transfer to the ICU.
   Cause remains uncertain - consider seizure given prior CVA, metabolic
   abnormalities, infection. Limited EEG with only evidence of
   encephalopathy. Episode yesterday associated with hypotension and
   bradycardia
 one concern was aspiration event with vagal response.
   Consider also primary cardiac conduction disorder. Prior head CTs
   without evidence of cerebral abscess
   - Neurology recommendations appreciated
   - Consider MRI/MRA head with MRV to further assess for cerebral venous
   thrombosis
   - Will hold on LP for now with coagulopathy
   - 24hr EEG
   - limit medications likely to lower seizure threshold (eg quinolones,
   carbepenems) to extent possible
   # Anemia
   Patient
s hematocrit dropped 24->19 yesterday in setting of
   supratherapeutic PTT on heparin drip. No gross bleeding, and no clearly
   identified intrabdominal source of blood on CT overnight, though
   increased density of abdominal fluid raised question of a slow bleed
   however examination of fluid with diagnostic tap did not indicate
   significant bleeding. Labs overnight did not show any evidence of
   hemolysis. Could have slow GIB eg [**1-21**] gastritis. Unlikely to be large
   pulmonary hemorrhage
   - guiac stools, monitor closely for any evidence of bleeding
   - holding heparin for now
   - look for fluid in lung by ultrasound
   - check q6h hcts
   - transfuse hct>25
   - continue PPI
   - follow up final CT abdomen read (no overt RP bleed on wet read)
   # Candidemia
   She has not had any positive cultures since transfer to the ICU.
   Suspect related to lines (PICC and or old HD catheter) in setting of
   TPN. These have now been removed. Opthal eval without evidence of eye
   involvement.
   - ID involved, appreciate recs
   - Continue micafungin pending fluc sensitivities, pending today
   - F/u cultures and CIS
   - Await TEE today or tomorrow
   - Favor reexamining thigh fluid collection as might have been seeded
   since last tap and would represent reservoir for recurrence
   # C diff colitis
   Toxin assays negative here.
   - Would continue PO vanc (day#1=[**3-21**]) and flagyl (day #1=[**3-25**]) for 14d
   post end of broad spectrum antibiotics (Sunday [**4-6**]). Will discuss
   whether flagyl required with ID team.
   # Hypotension:  Suspect [**1-21**] septic etiology. She appears
   intravascularly volume overloaded. Cortisol level normal. Patient was
   able to wean off Levophed overnight
   - monitor closely in setting of upcoming dialysis / CVVH today
   - Treating infection as above
   # ESRD on HD:
   Now on CVVH with new lines.
   - Renal recs appreciated
   - Fluid removal as BP tolerates, would try for -1L if possible as total
   body volume overloaded
   # HepB, autoimmune cholangiopathy:  S/p recent prednisone taper.
   Nutrition will be issue for the patient. Had abdominal infection s/p
   PEG placement, now with candidemia likely in setting of TPN.
   - Nutrition:  Dophoff placement for now vs re-evaluate ability to take
   POs (as will likely will not be enough intake & very  poor gag reflex
   now)
   - no steroids for now given sepsis and candidemia
   - Continue entecavir and tenofovir
   - Continue ursodiol
   - Continue to follow synthetic function tests daily
   - Liver recs appreciated
   # Abdominal wound: Wound vac changed Friday. ABD CT unchanged.
   - plastic surgery following, recs appreciated
   - continue local care, wound vac in place
   .
   # Portal venous and RIJ clots
   - Holding heparin for now given concern for bleeding
   .
   # DM:
   - Continue insulin
   - will d/c glargine for now and start on Humalog SSI until better
   intake w/Dobhoff feeds
