CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval for interval change

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
72 year old woman Advanced NSCLC and Central airway obstruction
s/p L-MS/LLL stent s/p bronch, SBT on [**12-4**]
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for interval change
INDICATION: 72-year-old woman with advanced nonsmall cell lung
cancer and central airway obstruction.

Portable AP view of the chest from [**3421-12-5**] is compared to the
prior from yesterday. Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and
the right PICC are in standard position. Partial opacification
of the entire mid and lower left hemithorax with associated left
volume loss and leftward mediastinal shift. A right hilar mass
is again seen with remainder of the right lung clear.

IMPRESSION: Multiple abnormalities as described above without
significant short interval change.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST

Reason: IV CONTRAST; eval extent of lung mass
Contrast: OPTIRAY

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
72 year old woman with recently dx lung ca [**10-17**] with increased
SOB and outside report of lung mass compression of airway
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
IV CONTRAST; eval extent of lung mass
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 72-year-old woman with recently diagnosed lung
cancer with increased shortness of breath. Please evaluate
extent of mass.

Multidetector CT images were obtained through the chest with
contrast at 1.25 and 5 mm reconstructions in the lung algorithm.

COMPARISON: Portable chest [**3421-11-27**] and [**3421-11-28**].

CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There is a large mass within the left
lung abutting the left heart border and invading the mediastinal
airway and vascular structures. This mass causes complete
collapse of the left upper lobe bronchus and partial collapse of
left lower lobe bronchus. Measurable solid components measures
8.4 x 5.6 cm (2:25) and 3.1 x 3.1 cm (2:34). This mass
compresses the left main pulmonary artery to a diameter of 5 mm
(2:21). Additionally, the left main stem bronchus is narrowed to
3 mm at the hilum of this invasive mass and adjacent
lymphadenopathy. Large conglomerate lymph nodes in the
subcarinal and right hilar region also causes narrowing of the
right bronchus intermedius to 3.5 mm and compression of the
right upper lobe bronchus. This right hilar lymphadenopathy
measures up to 22 mm. Additionally, there is a very large right
supraclavicular lymph node measuring 34 x 41 mm.

The patient is intubated. Just above the level of the carina,
lymphadenopathy compresses the trachea to 10 mm x 9 mm.

Within the remainder of the lung fields, multiple metastatic
nodules and masses are identified, the largest within the right
middle lobe measuring 28 x 35 mm. There are no significant
pleural effusions.

The heart is normal in size. As described above, there is
significant narrowing of the left main pulmonary artery. There
is probable narrowing of the left main pulmonary artery that is
compressed between subcarinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy
(2:26). There are atherosclerotic calcifications seen within the
aorta and coronary arteries. There is a small pericardial
effusion.

Within the imaged portion of the abdomen, the gallbladder is
noted to be distended (2:59). Additionally, just above the
gallbladder is a subtle rounded density, which may represent
metastatic lesion measuring 5.1 x 4.7 cm, (series 2:54). This
lesion is seen best on liver windows. The imaged portions of the
pancreas and spleen are normal. The adrenal glands are
thickened, but no focal masses are identified.

Bone windows show no evidence of suspicious lytic or sclerotic
osseous lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Large central left lung mass with post-obstructive collapse
of left upper lobe and partial collapse left lower lobe.
Associated large bilateral hilar and mediastinal conglomerate
lymph nodes, which encase the airway and the central pulmonary
arteries. Additional findings of metastatic disease throughout
the lungs and a large right supraclavicular lymph node.
2. Trachea and bronchi are encased/narrowed by conglomerate
nodal disease, with most severe narrowing at left main bronchus
proximal to left upper lobe obstruction.
3. Oval soft-tissue density structure in gallbladder fossa
region, likely a distended, sludge filled gallbladder but solid
mass is difficult to exclude. A right upper quadrant ultrasound
is recommended to confirm and further characterize this finding.
4. Probable discrete mass within the right lobe of the liver
superior to the gallbladder fossa. This finding can be evaluated
on the right upper quadrant ultrasound to evaluate the
gallbladder.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 72 year-old female recently diagnosed with
NSCLC [**10-17**] undergoing cehmotherapy (last [**3421-11-20**]) transferred
from [**Hospital 70**] Hospital to Dr.[**Name (NI) 4572**] Interventional Pulmonology
service at the [**Hospital1 37**] on [**3421-11-27**]
for evaluation of central airway obstruction and possible stent
placement.
.
On HD 1, she had an elevated WBC of 46.5 and her chest x-ray
demonstrated complete whiteout of the left chest.  She was
afebrile and was empirically started on vancomycin and
meropenem.  She was placed on BIPAP 10 and 5 to maintain her
oxygenation.
.
On HD 2, she underwent an elective intubation and bronchoscopy
which demonstrated extrinsic compression of the left and right
mainstem bronchi.  For details of the operation, please refer to
the operative report.  She was continued on the antibiotics and
remained afebrile.
.
On HD 3 the patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy, flexible
bronchoscopy, balloon dilatation, and Ultraflex covered metallic
stent placement (40 x 10) in the LLL.  For details of the
operation, please refer to the operative report.  She was
continued on the antibiotics,  remained afebrile and intubated.
Status post stent placement, the patient was found to have a-fib
and metoprolol and amiodarone were started.
.
On HD 4, she was continued on the antibiotics and remained
afebrile.  She ahd converted back to normal sinus rhythm.  She
was extubated early in the morning, however, by mid evening it
was found that she was having progressive respiratory failure
and re-intubation was done.  She underwent a flexible
bronchoscopy with tumor excision.  For details of the operation,
please refer to the operative report.
.
On HD 5, she underwent a flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic
aspiration
of retained secretions.  For details of the operation, please
refer to the operative report.  Trials of pressure support for
extubation failed with increasing respiratory rates and poor
arterial blood gases.
.
On HD 6, she underwent a flexible bronchoscopy with tumor
excision.  For details of the operation, please refer to the
operative report.  She was continued on the antibiotics and
remained afebrile.  Her WBC count had progressively decreased to
11.4.  Continued trials at extubation failed.
.
On HD 7, she underwent a flexible bronchoscopy with aspiration
of retained secretions.  For details of the operation, please
refer to the operative report.  She was continued on the
antibiotics and remained afebrile.  Continued attempts to wean
fromthe ventilator failed.
.
On HD 8, it was decided that she would benefit from pulmonary
rehabilitation for ventilator weaning.  She was continued on
BIPAP for good part of the afternoon without difficulty.  She
was continued on the antibiotics and remained afebrile.
.
On HD 9, it was decided to trasnfer her to a ventilatory
rehabilitation facility for further weaning off the vent.  Her
family was in agreement.  She was discharged to a rehabilitation
facility close to her home and will be followed by her primary
care physician as well as her oncologist for further treatment.

Patient will undergo a speech and swallow evaluation and pending
her passing the evaluation, she will resume a normal diet. Until
this is so, she will continue on tube feeds.
