   Assessment and Plan
   49 yo M with achondroplasia, chronic LE lymphedema a/w hypercarbic
   respiratory failure with an unclear precipitant.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory distress
 unclear whether due to PNA vs. pulm
   edema.  S/P 7 day course of vanco/levo/flagyl.  There is a likely
   component of acute on chronic hypercarbia.  Patient was extubated
   yesterday and has been doing well off the vent.
   -monitor resp status, wean off O2 as tolerated.
   -cont. prn diuresis with IV lasix to improve respiratory status
 goal
   to keep patient even to slightly negative.
   #R otitis externa
 difficult to evaluate TM involvement;
   symptomatically improving; re-examine later today.
   -polymixin-neomycin drops QID day [**2-26**]
   -cx due not suggest pseudomonas as etiology.
   -follow clinically
   #HTN
   -lopressor at home dose
   -convert captopril to lisinopril at 40 mg PO daily which represents a
   slight increase from his previous dose.
   # F/E/N
   -advance to regular diet.
   -volume goal: even to negative.
   -replace lytes PRN
