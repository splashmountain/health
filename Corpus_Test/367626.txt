   Assessment and Plan
   89F with h/o poorly controlled HTN, and moderate AS, who presented
   after pre-syncopal episode s/p fall, found to have an acute cerebellar
   infarct, transferred to CCU for closer monitoring.
   .
   # CVA: Developed acute L facial droop this morning, found to have L
   cerebellar and medullary stroke.  Neuro following.  Also has [**Month (only) 199**].
   sensation in V1-V3 distribution and on R side as well as left beating
   nystagmus.  Has [**Month (only) 199**]. flow in L vertebral artery and therefore BP should
   autoregulate to maintain perfusion given risk of brainstem
   hypoperfusion.  Started on heparin gtt given concern for embolic
   stroke.
   - Neuro following, appreciate their recs
   - q1 hour neuro checks
   - If ANY change in exam or MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] head CT to rule out evolving
   infarct vs. conversion to hemorrhagic stroke.
   - Let BP autoregulate, treat only if >180
   - IV labetolol prn BP>180, avoiding hydral and nitro given severe AS
   - Repeat head CT in am
   - Cont. Hep gtt without bolus, goal PTT 50-70
   - If BP very labile consider d/c heparin given risk for bleed.
   - Keep HOB <30 degrees
   - NPO
   .
   # pre-syncope - Etiology felt to be likely multifactorial with
   contributions from n/v, dehyration exerbating underlying mod-severe
   aortic stenosis, and malignant hypertension. ACS felt to be less
   likely. Now with cerebellar stroke which could also be contributing.
   - continue telemetry
   - CE mildly elevated, trop peaked at 0.13 likely demand
   - TTE shows stable mod-severe AS
   - prn anti-emetics
   - gentle IVF
   .
   #. Coronaries - no known h/o CAD, ?q's in lead III, avF.  EKG unchanged
   from prior.  Had trop elevation, however felt to be secondary to demand
   in setting of severe, uncontrolled HTN.
   - Cont. tele
   - Cont. ASA
   - IV labetolol prn as above
   .
   #. Pump: TTE shows EF >55% with LVH and severe AS.  Preload dependent.
   Currently appears euvolemic. recieved 1L IVF in ED and additional 1L
   IVF on admission.  Evaluated by CSURG for ? AVR, however patient
   declines surgery at this point.
   - IV labetolol as above
   - Monitor I/O
   - Gentle IVF o/n given NPO
   - Discuss possibility of valvuloplasty with pt. and family if
   neurologically stable
   - Once stable and able to take PO would likely benefit from [**Last Name (un) 281**]
   .
   #. Rhythm - NSR with PVCs in telemetry.
   .
   #. HTN - appears poorly controlled at baseline based on LVH on ECG and
   TTE, likely exacerbating subendocardial ischemia given her AS. Ideal
   medications for her would include BB and [**Last Name (un) 281**] given AS.
   - while unable to tolerate PO presently, will use IV labetolol,
   avoiding hydral and nitro given severe AS
   - Goal BP 120-180 in setting of acute stroke
   .
   #. ARF - Baseline Cr 1.1, was 1.7 on admission which is stable today.
   Likely [**1-8**] volume depletion and also poor forward flow in setting of
   AS.  FeNa 1% on admission.
   - Gentle IVF given NPO
   - Cont. to follow
   - holding HCTZ
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # nausea/vomiting - etiology unclear, developed after fall. ? whether
   this was related to TIA prior to CVA vs other process such infection (?
   viral gastroenteritis). per neuro, meningioma unlikely to cause these
   symptoms. No signs of edema on head CT. UTI unlikely, culture shows
   contamination. No abdominal discomfort and abdomen soft. CXR negative.
   No fevers.
   - if develops abdominal pain, will check AXR.
   - LFTs wnl.
   - zofran prn.
   .
   # meningioma - incidental finding, and not felt likely to contribute to
   presentation.
   - neuro following
   .
   #. FEN -  Patient failed S&S today.  Currently NPO.
   - Follow lytes, replete prn
   - Gentle IVF for maintenance

   - heparin gtt.
   - bowel regimen prn.
