   Assessment and Plan
   79M w/ hx of critical AS (valve area 0.5cm2), sCHF (EF 40), alcoholic
   cirrhosis, DM, recently admitted w/ sCHF exacerbation and worsening of
   AS, later developed MSSA sepsis and now s/p aortic valvuloplasty and
   PTCA to RCA on [**3380-6-1**].
   # Sepsis: Bacteria identified as MSSA. Surveillance cultures no growth
   . No peripheral manifestations of endocarditis, and TTE negative for
   vegetations. No obvious sources for staph bacteremia
   - Continue Nafcillin day 2 of 14
   - Wean phenylephrine as tolerated
   - Plan for PICC line so that cordis can be removed as it was placed
   while patient was bacteremic
   # Critical AS: AS critical by valve area. Now s/p valvuloplasty [**6-1**].
   Post cath check unremarkable.
   -  Repeat TTE
   # CAD: BMS x 2 to RCA [**6-1**]. Plavix loaded with 300 mg x1 and now
   writtedn for 75 mg daily
   - Continue plavix for at least 3 months
   # New onset A fib: Noted on admission. Cardioversion [**5-26**]. Chads 2 is
   4. Heparin gtt restarted after postcath check. Had been in NSR but now
   Afib rate controlled since procedure.
   - Continue Dofetelide. Plan to increase dose as Cr has normalized to
   250 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider starting coumadin while bridging with heparin. .
   # Hyponatremia: Improving.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr improved to 1 from 1.3. Likely improving with
   better hemodynamics in the setting of resolving septic shock.
   - Trend Cr.
   - goal 500 cc + today
   # Cirrhosis/G positive stools: - Likely [**2-21**] EtOH use. Pt reports that
   he stopped drinking approx 1 year ago.documented on MRCP as well as CT
   abdomen. Pt hepatitis panel negative for Hep A,B,C. Hct stable since
   admission to CCU.
   -2 pivs
   -active T and S
   -continue PPI
   # ?Aspiration: [**Name8 (MD) **] RN and patient report, patient coughs with thin
   liquids.
   - Request s and s eval today
   # Anxiety/Pain: Will attempt low dose benzo post procedure once stroke
   risk assessed
   # DM
 ISS
   # FEN
 Restart diet with aspiration precautions.
   # Access: Right Cordis with IJ. Was placed while bacteremic so will
   need to be replaced. PICC requested.
   # PPx
 No heparin given ? GIB.
   # Code- DNR/I
