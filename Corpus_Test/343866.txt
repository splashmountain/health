Chief Complaint:  CC: diarrhea, delirium
   MICU admission: hypotension, concern for sepsis
   HPI:
   86yoM ischemic CMA, EF 17%, prior STEMI, PVD, p/w worsening fatigue and
   diarrhea.  Family notes worsened malaise, fatigue, diarrhea, over past
   week, also with loose, non-bloody stools over past 3 days, then with
   decreased PO intake.  Wife has noticed more sundowning at night-time,
   worse than normal.  Of note, recently started digoxin and diuresed with
   diuril from wt of 160lbs to current wt ~140lbs.  Outpt EKG showed +lat
   lead scooping on [**9-29**].
      In [**Hospital1 52**] ED, 95/50, 95%ra, hr 70, lungs ctab, guaiac (-), otherwise
   benign exam.  EKG showed lateral lead scooping, given asa 325,
   lidocaine Jelly 2% (Urojet) 5mL Urojet.  Patient dropped SBP to 70s,
   given 3 250cc boluses, with appropriate bump to 90s, asympt.  Concern
   for digoxin toxicity, digibind given, but then stopped after dig level
   returned at 1 - only half vial administered.  Toxicology consulted.
   CXR showed trace bil effusions, +streaky atelectasis in RLL, final read
   ?pna --> given levaquin and ctx for CAP.  Cardiology consulted: recs
   for careful fluid resuscitation.  2 large bore pIVs.  Admitted to MICU
   for concern for evolving pneumo-sepsis.

   Imaging: ECHO [**2-25**]:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. A possible thrombus is seen in
   the body of the left atrium (acoustic artifact from the prosthetic
   mitral annulus may be causing this finding; best excluded by
   transesophageal echocardiography). The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
   ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to
   akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls, and hypokinesis of the
   rest of the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
   increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
   ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
   dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is
   mildly dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
   leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis
   (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. A
   bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The mitral prosthesis
   appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
   gradients. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
   is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2637-10-26**], the mitral valve has been replaced; the
   left ventricular ejection fraction is markedly reduced; severe
   tricuspid regurgitation is now present. Cannot exclude left atrial
   thrombus/mass.

   Assessment and Plan
   86yoM ischemic CMA, EF 17%, prior STEMI, PVD, p/w worsening fatigue and
   diarrhea, admitted to MICU for concern for developing sepsis, likely
   pulmonary infection.
   # shock/infection/sepsis: <1 of 4 SIRS criteria met, as no
   leukocytosis, no fever, no bandemia, no tachypnea, no tachycardia (but
   on digoxin), but hemodynamic instability with  ?e/o infection on cxr,
   concern for developing sepsis presention.  Lactate elevated at 2.
   Given cold extremities, more likely cardiogenic shock.
   - gentle IVF boluses to maintain MAPs>55, UOP >30cc/hr
   - transfuse hct >27
   - trend lactate, ag (presented with ag 12)
   - continue levofloxacin and ceftriaxone for CAP, D#1 [**10-5**]
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum cxs, urine legionella
   - trend WBC, fever curve
   - TTE am
   # cardiovascular/pump: signficant LF dysfunction with EF 17%, likely
   with hemodynamic decompensation from diuresis as outpt, with
   significant loss in wt ~20lbs.
   - TTE AM
   - hold digoxin/diuretics given AR
   - cycle CEs (not likely ACS, moderate TIMI risk score)
   - cont asa 81(CKs flat)
   - hold htn meds, beta blocker, amiodorone
   - check TSH given amio use and relative hypotension and fatigue
   # arf/metabolic alkalosis - baseline cr ~2-2.5, now with rise to 4.6,
   with low bp, dry exam, low chloride, low EF, decreased PO intake,
   likely pre-renal physiology.  Alkalosis likely [**12-21**] to pre-renal with
   hco3 retention from over-diuresis or from fluid loss from diarrhea over
   past 3 days (although with arf may suspect more acidosis).  Given
   eosinophils, normocytic anemia, and alkalosis, consideration for
   adrenal insufficiency.
   - foley, trend UOP
   - renally dose meds
   - add-on urine lytes, calculate FeNa/Feurea
   - urine chloride to assess metabolic alkalosis (if cl can be added on
   prior to NS)
   - renal consult in AM
   - fecal smear r/o GI infection (no abx to suggest Cdiff risk)
   - random cortisol
 if nl, hold on stress dose steroids (did take
   medrol dose pak in [**5-26**] for
pemphigus
   # hyperbilirubinemia - tbili 1.6, no transaminitis or cholangitic lab
   panel, hct stable, no signs of hemolysis
   - fractionate bili with direct
   - t/s
   - if indirect bili elevated, will send hemolysis labs
   # heme/coagulopathy - has had >1yr of elevated INR without reported
   intake of coumadin (despite hx of afib), other transaminases nl with no
   hx of liver disease.
