   Continued to spike fevers to 103s throughout the day with tachycardia
   to 150s. Gave Coreg with HR down to 90s and BP down to 90s/50s.
   Cultures including PEG site culture were sent again. Patient was
   re-started on Vanc/Zosyn per ID recs. Pt also received an abdominal U/S
   to assess for abscess underneath the PEG tube site but was
   inconclusive. However in the evening began spiking to 104.5. Was placed
   on cooling blanket, given ice cold saline bolus (500mL), one dose of
   motrin 400mg and tylenol Q6H.   If necessary may need CT
   Chest/Abd/Pelvis today per ID recs.

   Assessment and Plan
   50M s/p MI with CHF (EF 10%) who was admitted for respiratory distress
   after being found down in his home. He has had a prolonged intubation,
   now with trach since [**6-28**]. He is dependent on cardiac output for
   renal function and renal function is exquisitely sensitive to changes
   in perfusion. He has been continued to be difficult to wean from the
   ventilator.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]). Pts failure likely
   multifactorial.  Multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing, but likely now
   mostly because of severe CHF (EF 10%). Has [**Last Name (un) 1424**]-[**Doctor Last Name 1425**] respirations
   intermittently, with alkalemic blood gases.CXR today less concerning
   for RLL infiltrate
 may have been episode of aspiration. Sputum
   cultures pending but previous grew MSSA and E.coli.
   - F/u gram stains and cxs.
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn.
   - Abx (ceftazidime and nafcillin) were given for pos MSSA and E. coli
   sputum cx. However due to concern for RLL infiltrate, in setting of
   unusually high fever and rising WBC, started  vanc and zosyn [**3214-7-14**].
   - Keep HOB elevated to decrease effects of obesity on ventilation.
   # Fever: Has been febrile for his entire, extended MICU course.
   However, recently been spiking to 103s and 104s which is higher than
   previous fevers to 100s and 101s. WBC also up over last few days. New
   RLL infiltrate being treated with Vanc/zosyn. Concern for abscess in
   abdomen/pelvis as draining purulent discharge from PEG site. D/C
   fentanyl patch as can have elevated fentanyl levels in setting of fever
   if on patch. Also tried to wean off fentanyl as 1-10% of patients can
   develop fever on this drug.  Still concern for infectious etiology,
   however, so patient will be pan-CT
d today to look for abscess.
   -         Tylenol 650 q6 and cooling blanket for fever.
   -          Sent stool for c. diff.
   -                Sent swab from surrounding PEG for gram stain and cx.
   -                F/u CT chest/Abd/pelvis today
   -                Will check TSH as pt on levothyroxine and TSH not
   checked recently.
   -                Will also check LFTs to r/o hepatitis or gall bladder
   disease as cause for fevers.
   -                Will replace CVL and pull/culture old line
    # Shock:  Likely a combination of septic shock and cardiogenic shock.
   UOP has been good (consistently above 30cc/hr) but hypotension
   continues (to low of 82/46). Pt is febrile, as above.
   -         Keep CVPs in ~[**11-11**] with fluid as needed.
   - Continue to monitor UOP. Increases with decreased HR and decreased
   fever so likely treating the fever will help the UOP.
Ventricular tachycardia: Intermittent. Up to 170s yesterday, likely
   exacerbated by fever.
   -          Carvedilol 25mg twice daily. Does help tachycardia
   transiently but in setting of high fevers does not sustain effect.
   -          Continue to monitor and use fluid boluses.
   -          Consider loading with amiodarone if VT becomes sustained or
   leads to hemodynamic instability.
   -          Continue to treat fever and other comorbidities.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC. Pt with severe
   cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   -          Continue with coreg at 25mg.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB).
   - Carvedilol 25mg QD
   - restarted coumadin at 5mg QD (home dose) [**3214-7-12**] however since may
   need central line replaced today in order to culture the old one will
   not give dose tonight and will transfer to heparin instead.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- After discussions
   with renal is seems that his cardiac output is only barely enough to
   maintain GFR. When his CO is higher, he can filter the burden of his
   high levels of urea serves as a potent diuretic for free water. As a
   result, when he is hymodynamically strong enough to have a GFR, he
   rapidly diureses water and urea resulting in hypernatremia. Cr 1.3
   today. Renal signed off yesterday but now Cr slightly increased at 1.3.
   did receive 400mg motrin last night for fever which may be contributing
   but more likely he is not perfusing his kidneys with increasingly high
   fevers and tachycardia keeping his CO low.
   - Holding lasix  as above
   - Continue to monitor Cr, BUN, UOP.
   # Hypernatremia: As above, related to urea diuresis when GFR is
   possible. Na concentration is wnl range now.
   -          Free water flushes decreased to 200 mL q 4 hrs.
   -          Monitor electrolytes
   -          Continue to put meds in D5W fluid.
   # Concern for ileus: Pt previously had high residuals; no longer a
   problem.  Pt [**Name2 (NI) 1779**] well.
   - continue to monitor stools.
