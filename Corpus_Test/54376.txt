Brief Hospital Course:
The pt tolerated the procedure well, please see the operative
note for details.  The pt was extubated and transferred to the
floor in a stable condition.  The pt's diet was advanced and his
immediate post op course was remarkable only for hypoglycemia.
[**Doctor First Name 8195**] was consulted.  The pt developed nausea and vomiting on
POD 6 and his urine output began to decline.  He was bolused
with IVF with some improvement.  His abdomen was distended and a
therapeutic paracentiesis was performed.  Fluid analysis was
consisted with SBP and ceftriaxone was started.  A ct abdomen
was performed (see results below).  His renal function
deteriorated and he developed acute renal failure.  His hepatic
function also decompensated and his INR rose to > 2.5.  He was
transferred to the ICU for further monitoring on [**3502-8-27**].  A
CVL/swan ganz catheter/NGT/Aline were placed.  He became
hypotension despite fluid resusitation on POD 9 and neo ggt was
started.  The pt was given FFP/vit k for his coagulopathy.  He
became increasingly acidotic and was intubated for respiratory
distress.  Broad spectrum antibiotics were started.  The pt's
clinically condition slowly improved; his liver/renal function
and coagulopathy improved, his urine output increased, he was
weaned from the vent and off pressors. TPN was initiated and
continued throughout most of his hospital stay.  He was
extubated without difficulty on POD15.
He passed a video swallow study and was started on PO's.  He was
doing well and transferred to the floor in a stable condition on
POD22.  On [**9-10**], the pt'd urine output began to decrease. IVF
boluses were given without response.

CT abd [**3502-8-28**]: Redemonstration of bowel wall thickening to the
segment of distal small bowel just proximal to the anastomosis.
Contrast study reveals lack of bowel wall enhancement, and lack
of enhancement to mesenteric vasculature draining this segment
of small bowel. The findings are thereby highly concerning for
bowel ischemia/New left lower lobe consolidation, likely
secondary to aspiration/Increase to intra-abdominal ascites and
mesenteric edema, mildly increased

Echocardiogram [**3502-8-28**]: EF 55%, 1+MR, mild pulm HTN

OR Pathology [**3502-8-19**]:
Adenocarcinoma, Low-grade (well or moderately differentiated)
Primary Tumor:  pT3:  Tumor invades through the muscularis
propria into the subserosa or the nonperitonealized pericolic or
perirectal soft tissues. No regional lymph node metastasis.
Proximal margin: Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma:  Distance of
tumor from closest margin:  185 mm.
Distal margin:  Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma:  Distance of
tumor from closest margin:  40 mm.
Circumferential (radial) margin: Uninvolved by invasive
carcinoma:  Distance of tumor from closest margin:  7 mm.
