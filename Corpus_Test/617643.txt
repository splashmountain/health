   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**3389**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis
   with valve area of 0.3.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**2-29**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**3389**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3, waiting
   now for AVR, likely early next week.  Now diuresing to optimize fluid
   status prior to surgery.  Yesterday was -1.8L with only slight Cr
   increase and reports feeling better.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
   - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Diuresis with Lasix IV/PO as tolerated by blood pressure, goal of
   even to -500ccs today.  Off lasix for now.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had elevated LFTs, though they appear
   to be improving.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1168**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 56**] have diuresed as
   much as will be tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr did bump yesterday to 1.4 but trended back down.
   - D/C Lasix gtt, will continue gentle diuresis for now w/ goal as much
   as tolerated
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**3396-5-11**].
   ID was consulted yesterday regarding guidance on when to restart the
   patient's HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until
   after cardiac surgery [**2-29**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 131, which has increased
   steadily since [**8-4**].  His hyponatremia was likely secondary to poor
   forward renal flow and appropriate ADH response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.5L length of stay. Goal now even to slightly negative.
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
   -          Continue Folate and thiamine.
   -
   # Coagulation.- VitK on Friday, [**3396-8-5**]. INR now 1.3
