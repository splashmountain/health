   - Went down to [**Hospital Ward Name 372**] 3 where she triggered twice for tachypnea and
   desats to low 80's.  Eventually bounced back to CCU because of frequent
   nursing needs.
   - Too out of breath to get OOB with PT.
   - Dobhoff remained in as nursing felt she was not getting adequate POs.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo F with COPD presents with anterior MI and failed PCI on a tight
   proximal lesion currently on medical management, s/p pacemaker
   placement complicated by RV perforation and right leg ischemia.
   # HAP : WBC trending down, now on [**Last Name (un) **] for pseudomonas and levo for
   stenotrophomonas. Per ID, steno may be a colonizer, but started Levo
   due to continued respiratory distress.  Remains afebrile, but is on
   steroids due to COPD.
   - cont abx meropenem day #[**12-7**] (pseudomonas not tested for quinolone
   sensitivity)
   - cont levo day #[**5-3**]
   - maintain MAPs>60
   - blood cx and urine cx negative (final)
   - monitor temperature and trend WBC (normalized)
   - will be important to continue to mobilize her daily.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt was had O2 requirement at home.  Returned to
   CCU because of frequent desaturations.
   - On 50mg prednisone and tapering.
   - cont albuterol/ipratropium Q4, on home doses of Spiriva and Advair.
   - daily CXR
   - monitor resp status, esp w/ pneumothorax
   - On standing 40mg PO Lasix, yesterday -394ccs.  Goal today slightly
   negative with additional prn.
   .
   # RV PERFORATION: Pt with tamponade after perforation of RV during
   pacer placement. Repeat ECHO showed trivial effusion and no e/o
   tamponade. Drain was removed [**6-9**]. Hct steady.
   -daily Hct, fluctuating slightly, consider repeat ECHO if hemodynamic
   changes.
   - Active T&S
   - cont to monitor hemodynamics closely
   .
   # RIGHT LEG ISCHEMIA: Distal pulses were lost after placement of right
   femoral a-line. s/p left SFA thrombectomy, femoral endarterectomy,
   right fasciotomy. +dopplerable pulses post-procedure. CK wnl
   - appreciate vascular recs
   - cont to check dopplers
   - monitor wound site, keep groin dry w/ desitin
   # RHYTHM: H/O paroxysmal Afib but presents with slow afib and AV
   dissociation.  Pt underwent pacemaker placement that was complicated by
   RV perforation. CXR neg for PTX. Pt previously with a-fib with RVR, now
   A-paced. Treated with amio
   - appreciate EP recs
   - Now on Amiodarone 400mg PO BID.
   - On metoprolol 25mg TID for rate control.
   - no warfarin; on asa/plavix
   - cont to monitor on tele
   # CORONARIES: Pt transferred for NSTEMI and is s/p ccath that  focal
   LAD lesions that could not be intevened . Pt was being medically
   managed and stable.  BP meds were held secondary to hypotension.
   - cont ASA and plavix given stable Hct when taking po (can change ASA
   to pr)
   - cont BB, ACE-inh
   .
   # PUMP: EF 45-50%,  +500 cc o/n.
   - daily CXR
   .
   # COPD: Pt on steroids for flare. Pulm was consulted prior to RV
   perforation. Recommended non-con CT for eval for right hilum. Question
   as to whether pt truly as COPD or other process given recent worsening
   over the last year.
   - cont steroids with taper.
   - cont albuterol/ipratropium
   .
   # HTN: Pressures have been labile but currently stable.
   -cont metoprolol for now as above
   -now on captopril 12.5mg TID
   .
