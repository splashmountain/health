Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 15825**] was admitted and taken directly to the operating room
where Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed a mitral valve repair. For surgical
details, please see seperate dictated operative note. Following
the procedure, he was brought to the CSRU for invasive
monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated without incident. His CSRU course was otherwise
uneventful and he transferred to the SDU on postop day one. He
remained in a normal sinus rhythm. He tolerated beta blockade
which was advanced as tolerated. Over several days, he continued
to make clinical improvements with diuresis and was medically
cleared for discharge on postoperative day four. Of note,
routine chest x-rays revealed a tiny right apical pneumothorax
which decreased in size over several days. In addition, he
platelet count postop was low. HIT assays were checked,
returning negative. At discharge, his
BP was 105/52 with a HR of 60-80 and room air saturations of
100%.
