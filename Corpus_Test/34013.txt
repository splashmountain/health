[**2819-6-5**] ECHO
PRE-CPB:1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic root. The ascending aorta is
markedly dilated There are simple atheroma in the ascending
aorta. There is a dissection flap that originates around the
right coronary and extends into the arch. The aortic arch is
moderately dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic arch. There is intramural thrombus present in the
descending aorta. There is spontaneous echo contrast in the
descending thoracic aorta. The descending thoracic aorta is
mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral
valve leaflets are not well seen. Mitral regurgitation is
present but cannot be quantified.
7. There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusions of nitroglycerine. Well-seated synthetic
graft in the aortic position from the sinotubular junction. No
apparent leak. There is residual intramural thromus at the level
of right coronary cusp. Coronary flow is visible in both the RCA

CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:
   None.



Provisional Findings Impression: RSRc MON [**2819-6-10**] 2:08 PM


Evolution of multiple subacute infarctions throughout right

temporal, bilateral occipital, and cerebellar lobes. No
hemorrhage, mass
effect, or midline shift.


Final Report
HISTORY: 77-year-old female with emergent AAA repair several
days prior.
Please evaluate for ischemic event or hemorrhage.

COMPARISON: CTA head four days prior.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial imaging was performed from the
cranial vertex to
the foramen magnum without IV contrast.

HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Multifocal cortical and subcortical

hypodensities involving the frontal, parietal, and occipital
lobes as well as
the cerebellum bilaterally are more well defined, indicative of
evolving
ischemic infarction. There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect,
or shift of
normally midline structures. The visualized paranasal sinuses
are
unremarkable. The mastoid air cells are clear. Mild
periventricular
hypodensity is indicative of chronic small vessel ischemic
disease.

IMPRESSION: Multiple bilateral hypodensities consistent with
evolving
subacute infarction.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Over the interval, the patient has
undergone
tracheostomy which is appropriately positioned. A right internal
jugular
central venous line has been removed and there is no
pneumothorax. The left-
sided PICC line tip resides within the proximal SVC. The
Dobbhoff tube has
been removed. There is a persistent left retrocardiac opacity
and small left-
sided pleural effusion. There is a small right-sided pleural
effusion as
well.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 22**] on [**2819-6-4**] for emergent
surgical management of her type A dissection. She was taken to
the operating room where she underwent replacement of her
ascending aorta and hemiarch using a 38mm gelweave graft.
Postoperatively she was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. She received multiple blood products.
Her sedation was weaned to off but she remained unresponsive to
pain without pupillary reflex, head CT showed Subacute
infarction involving the cerebellum, frontal, parietal, and
occipital lobes bilaterally as well as chronic infarction in the
right temporal lobe. She began having seizures and was loaded
with and started on dilantin. She was followed closely by
neurology. Dobhoff tube was placed and she was started on tube
feeds.
She remained unresponsive. Repeat head ct showed Multiple
bilateral hypodensities consistent with evolving subacute
infarction. She was started on cipro and zosyn for gram negative
bacteria in sputum and UTI. General surgery consulted to plan
for trach/PEG placement. Her neuro exam improved very slightly
and she opened her eyes to noxious stim. Repeat EEG showed mild
to moderate encephalopathy but no evidence of seizures.
Neurological prognosis remained poor. Tracheostomy and PEG tube
were placed on [**6-17**]. Dilantin level should be maintained at
15-20. Tube feeds were restarted, and she tolerated 8 hours of
trach collar. PICC line became totally occluded seconadry to IV
dilantin and her dilantin was changed to PO. BUE U/S for edema
showed right axillary DVT but none on left. PICC line was
changed to a single lumen. She was raedy for discharge to rehab
on [**6-19**].
