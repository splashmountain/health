[**3148-4-19**] CTA abdomen:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilobed fusiform abdominal aortic aneurysm with overall
dimensions
measuring up to 4.8 x 5.2 cm. No definite signs of rupture.
2. Mildly dilated small bowel with segments which appear
hyperenhancing and  slightly thickened which raises concern for
an inflammatory or an infectious  etiology. Please correlate
clinically.
3. Soft tissue nodularity involving the pelvic floor/perineum
which could
reflect old inflammatory changes though clinical correlation is
advised.
4. Bilateral renal scarring and renal hypodensities, the largest
of which
appear to represent simple cysts.
5. Complex ventral hernia, containing non-obstructed small and
large bowel.
6. Extremely demineralized bony pelvis with evidence of old
insufficiency
fractures. Stabilization hardware in the lower lumbar spine.

[**3148-4-20**] ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 60%); however, the basal inferior and posterior segments
are hypokinetic. The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). Mild to
moderate ([**12-7**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are
myxomatous. There is mild posterior leaflet mitral valve
prolapse. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

[**3148-4-22**] Left Hip XR:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute fractures or dislocations. MRI is the
recommended
study of choice if clinical suspicion for occult fracture is
high.
2. Unusual mottled appearance of bilateral iliac bones, of
nonspecific
etiology.

[**3148-4-23**] CTA abdomen:
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable abdominal aortic aneurysm without signs of acute
rupture. No
retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. Fluid-filled distended loops of small bowel, without discrete
transition point, findings suggestive of ileus.
3. Cystic lesions within the kidneys, the largest in the left
upper pole of indeterminate attenuation. Followup renal
ultrasound should be considered.
4. Stable ventral hernia without evidence of acute obstruction.
5. Stable severely mottled pelvic bones of uncertain etiology.
6. New small bilateral pleural effusions.

[**3148-4-28**] KUB: Increased gaseous distension of several bowel
loops. When
compared with recent CT, this most likely represents continued
ileus; however, obstruction cannot be excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the surgery service for evaluation
and treatment.

HD 1- She was transferred from an OSH with the chief complaint
of acute onset of lower back pain and a CT scan s/o increase in
size of her preexisting AAA. She required a nitroprusside drip
won the day of admission to keep her SBP in the range of 100-
110 mmHg. She was then transferred to the CVICU for close
monitoring.

HD 2- The patient was doing well. her pain was well controlled
with IV morphine and she remained hemodynamically stable. A
cardiology consult was sought to assess the cardiac risk for
possible surgical repair of the AAA. They recommended giving
ASA, lopressor and a perfusion scan. An ECHO was done to assess
the current cardiac functional status.

HD 3- The patient was started on a small dose of PO lopressor
and she stayed stable throughout the day. She was transferred
out of the CVICU to the VICU.

HD4 - A sudden increase in the Serum creatinine from 1.6 t 1.9
was noted. Also, there was a deacrease in the hourly urine
output. She recieved 2 boluses of NS of 500cc each followed by
mIVF. Her lisinopril was stopped and a FeNa was calculated which
was found to be 0.2%.

HD 5 - She started complaining of pain in the left hip in the
morning. She was hen sent down for an XR of the hip that showed
no e/o any fracture. Also, a wound care consult was sought to
assess her bed sore.

HD 6 - She started complaining of increased abdominal pain and
was slightly tender on physical examination. A CT scan of the
abdomen was done to diagnose an increase in size of the AAA and
any other ongoing pathological process. The ACS team was
consulted at this time and no surgical intervention was
recommended by the team.

HD 7 - There was an improvement in her Creatinine which was down
to 1.6. She c/o nausea on multiple occasions following which an
EKG was done to r/o ongoing myocardial ischemia. her cardiac
enzymes were also negative.

HD 8 - Ciprofloxacin and FLagyl were started due to concern for
bowel ischemia. Once again, there was a sudden increase in the
creatinine from 1.6 to 1.9. She was given 2 boluses of IVFs, 500
cc each and the mIVF rate was also increased.

Starting on HD 9, patient began to have worsening crampy
abdominal pain. She was no longer having bowel movements. Her
antibiotics were discontinued as her C-diff was negative. KUB
was performed that was consistent with ileus. Patient had
intermittent episodes of emesis, but did not require an NGT.
General surgery was re-consulted and did not feel that this was
due to the patient's ventral hernia, and suggested no
intervention. This new pain was also not felt to be due to her
AAA. Geriatrics was consulted and felt this was likely due to
her colonic stricture that was diagnosed a year prior after a
lower GI bleed episode. The patient was started on a very
aggressive bowel regimen to soften her stools. On HD11, patient
finally began to have severaly loose stools, and began to feel
much better. GI was also consulted and suggested that if she has
these obstructive symptoms again that a stent could be
considered for palliation.

HD 12 - She began complaining of jaw pain and was evaluated by
OMFS service.  Their evaluation was that she had a close lock
consistent with anterior displaced disc without reduction and
recommended a soft diet and  motrin 600mg prn and heat pack to
the face if pain developed/persisted.  In addition, she should
follow-up with her usual dentist or the OMFS service for this.

Overall, after long discussions with the family it was decided
to not pursue surgical intervention for her AAA. Given her
several cardiac problems, it was deemed too risky to proceed
with surgery. The patient and the family agreed with this and
she was discharged to rehab in stable condition without any
acute issues.
