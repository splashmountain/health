HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 67 year old white male has
a known left carotid stenosis and was initially admitted to
[**Hospital 219**] Hospital on [**3004-1-6**], with extreme viral symptoms
including fatigue, malaise and now lower extremity edema.  He
had been feeling well prior to the flu episode and did not
have symptoms of congestive heart failure.  He had a positive
troponin of 3.[**Street Address(2) 30719**] changes on his EKG.  His
echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 15% with
generalized akinesis, hypokinesis of the septum and one to
two plus mitral regurgitation.  He presented to the outside
hospital with paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea and
was diuresed and started on an ACE inhibitor.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 58**] for a
cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Positive stress test in [**2989**].
2.  Leg fracture in the past.
3.  Left carotid stenosis of 50 to 80%.
4.  He has had some visual field loss since childhood.

MEDICATIONS:  He was on no medications at home.

ALLERGIES:   He has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   He has a 30 pack year smoking history and
quit two weeks prior to admission.  He drinks alcohol rarely.
He is married and lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] works in real
estate.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unremarkable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On physical examination, he is a thin
white male in no apparent distress.  Vital signs were stable;
he was afebrile.  HEENT examination is normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Extraocular movements intact.  Oropharynx had
poor dentition.  Neck was supple with full range of motion;
no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Carotids were two plus
and equal bilaterally without bruits.  Lungs were had
bibasilar crackles.  Cardiovascular examination had a regular
rate and rhythm with a III/VI holosystolic murmur.  Abdomen
was soft, nontender, with positive bowel sounds, no masses or
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities were without cyanosis,
clubbing or edema.  Pulses were two plus and equal
bilaterally except for his dorsalis pedis which were
Doppler-able.  Neurological examination was non-focal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was catheterized and had a
tubular 80% stenosis of the left main coronary artery, a
proximal 90% stenosis of the left anterior descending.  The
left circumflex was non-dominant and was occluded ostially.
The right coronary artery was dominant and occluded ostially.

The patient did become hypotensive and had a cardiac index of
1.4 in the catheterization laboratory.  He had an
intra-aortic balloon placed and he was started on Dobutamine.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted.

The patient also had a carotid ultrasound which showed a left
carotid stenosis, 50 to 80%.  He remained in the Coronary
Care Unit.

An echocardiogram revealed his ejection fraction was 15% and
on [**1-13**] he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft times
three with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending, reversed saphenous vein graft to the patent
ductus arteriosus and obtuse marginal, and a mitral valve
replacement with a #28 millimeter [**Doctor Last Name 1326**] [**Doctor Last Name 529**]
annuloplasty band.  The crossclamp time was 86 minutes; total
bypass time 134 minutes.

He was transferred to the CSRU on epinephrine, Levophed,
Milrinone, Dobutamine and Propofol.  He was stable on his
postoperative night.  His Levophed was quickly weaned.  We
then added Nitroglycerin for his blood pressure.  He was
started on amiodarone for ventricular ectopy.  He was
extubated on postoperative day number one.  He remained on
epinephrine and Milrinone and his balloon pump was slowly
weaned and was discontinued on postoperative day number four.
He then remained on epinephrine, Milrinone and Nitroglycerin
and was also followed by the Heart Failure Team.

He was gently diuresed as well.  He eventually weaned off his
epinephrine and then his Milrinone as he was started on
Captopril.  He continued to improve and on postoperative day
number 13, he was transferred to the Floor in stable
condition.

He continued to have a stable postoperative course.  His left
lower extremity had a saphenectomy site which did have a
little swelling but it was not infected, and this improved
over a couple of days.  He was eventually switched over to
Lisinopril and started on some Toprol XL at a low dose.  On
postoperative day number 13, he was discharged to home in
stable condition.
