   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   77yo gentleman with h/o presumed COPD as well as restriction from
   scoliosis and left hemidiaphragm elevation admitted with respiratory
   distress in the setting of fever and cough.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):
   Patient has acute decompensation superimposed on chronic lung disease.
   No PFTs in OMR, but likely has predominantly restrictive physiology.
   Acute process may have been aspiration pneumonia vs pneumonitis, viral
   infection, pneumonia, or COPD exacerbation.  Contributors to his poor
   baseline lung function include COPD as well as severe scoliosis and
   left hemidiaphragm elevation.   Only on intermittent BIPAP overnight,
   now on facemask
   - Wean to nasal cannula as tolerated
   - No need to repeat ABG as respiratory status continues to improve
   - continue vanc/cefepime for possible aspiration vs health care
   associated pneumonia
   - Start prednisone 60mg QD; d/c solumedrol
   - continue atrovent and albuterol nebs, standing q6 and prn
   - Can consider repeating CT chest when more stable to evaluate
   underlying disease
   - Follow-up sputum culture speciation
   - guafenesin, hyoscyamine to decrease oral secretions
   .
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN):
   Possible sources include pneumonia, UTI, viral infection (such as
   influenza), pneumonitis, or C diff.  Does not report diarrhea, but has
   had significant C diff infections in the past.  Not history of
   quinolone resistant UTIs in the past.  Blood culture from ED now
   growing GPCs in clusters, although this could be contaminant.  Max temp
   in 24 hours is 37.2
   - Urine culture consistent with fecal contamination
   - Continue coverage with vanc and cefepime for now
   - influenza neg and tamiflu stopped
   #URINARY TRACT INFECTION:
   Culture shows psuedomonas and E.Coli as preliminary read.
   --Await final speciation and antibiotic sensitivity
   --Continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now
   # Tachycardia:  Likely due to respiratory distress and dehydration (he
   has concentrated urine, elevated BUN, and hct above baseline).
   Received gentle volume resuscitation and tachycardia improved.  HR this
   morning in the 70s.
   - Gentle fluids if needed (but careful not to volume overload)
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Elevated cardiac biomarkers: No longer acute issue
   EKG is reassuring and he denies chest pain.  Likely has some demand
   ischemia from respiratory distress and tachycardia.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  resolved with repeat blood draws.
   .
 .H/O PARKINSON'S DISEASE
   - continue sinemet
   - continue hyoscyamine, presumably to decrease oral secretions
   .
   # AFib:  continue amiodarone; not on anticoagulation given h/o GI bleed
   .
   # ? h/o Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue statin and ASA
   .
   # h/o DVTs:
   - monitor exam given h/o line-associated and unprovoked DVTs in the
   past
   - not on anticoagulation given h/o GI bleed
   .
   # Anxiety:  ativan prn
