Service:  Cardiothoracic Service

CHIEF COMPLAINT/HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a
59 year old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy
who presented to an outside hospital with a history of
dyspnea on exertion times one week and bilateral lower
extremity edema.  The patient initially attributed these
symptoms to his asthma, however, when the symptoms continued
to worsen and he was short of breath at rest, he presented to
the hospital.  At that time he denied chest pain,
palpitations, sharp pain or any extremity pain.  Chest x-ray
at that time showed congestive heart failure.  He was given
Lasix with no change in his shortness of breath but a marked
decrease in his lower extremity edema.  Arterial blood gases
at that time was 7.45, 40, 56, with an AA gradient of 24.  An
echocardiogram and stress test were ordered at that time.
Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 19%.  Stress
test showed reversible inferior wall defect.  The patient was
then transferred to [**Hospital6 656**] for
cardiac catheterization and further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for ischemic
cardiomyopathy, mitral regurgitation, mild to moderate aortic
stenosis, diabetes mellitus, and asthma.

ALLERGIES:  He states an allergy to Sulfa.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Glucophage 500 mg t.i.d., Slo-[**Hospital1 **]
no dose given, Ventolin nebulizer, Aspirin 81 mg a day, Lasix
intravenously at an outside hospital.  Coreg 3.125 mg and
Lisinopril 5 mg q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, smokes times 40 years, recently
quit.  Works as a sales executive.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  After admission to [**Hospital6 2138**] the patient was brought to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory.  Please see the catheterization
results for full details.  In summary the catheterization
showed a cardiac output of 4.45 with an index of 2.2 and
wedge of 13.  PA is 38/21.  Coronaries showed left main with
a 70% lesion, left anterior descending with mild disease,
circumflex with no critical lesions and right coronary artery
with mid segment total occlusion with distal flow from the
left anterior descending.

Physical examination on admission - General, white man in no
acute distress, alert and oriented times three.  Pupils
equal, round and reactive to light.  Chest clear to
auscultation anteriorly.  Cardiovascular, distant
heartsounds, S1 and S2, abdomen soft with positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities, no edema, cyanosis or clubbing.

Laboratory data at the outside hospital showed the hemoglobin
A1c of 10.6, arterial blood gases 7.45, pCO2 39, pO2 55,
white count 5.8, hematocrit 42.9, platelets 387, sodium 137,
potassium 4.3, chloride 101, carbon dioxide 24, BUN 16,
creatinine 0.8, glucose 310.  Liver function tests were
normal.  Creatinine kinase and troponin were negative times
three.  Cholesterol 215.  HDL 82.  LDL 122.  The patient had
a Persantine Myoview which showed an estimated ejection
fraction of 19%, grossly dilated left ventricular with
multiple perfusion defects, septal and inferior lateral walls
with reversibility in the inferior and lateral wall.
Echocardiogram done showed an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%
with a dilated left ventricle and mitral regurgitation.

Given these results along with the patient's cardiac
catheterization, intra-aortic balloon pump was placed and
following catheterization the Cardiothoracic Surgery Service
was consulted.  The patient was seen and accepted for
coronary artery bypass grafting +/- mitral valve replacement.
On [**1-23**], the patient was brought to the Operating Room
where he underwent coronary artery bypass graft times three
with mitral valve annuloplasty.  Please see operative report
for full details.  In summary, the patient had a coronary
artery bypass graft times three with left internal mammary
artery to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft
to the posterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to
the diagonal and mitral valve annuloplasty with a #28 band.
He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred from the
Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  At
the time of transfer, the patient had an intra-aortic balloon
pump at 1:1, Propofol, Milrinone and Levophed infusing.  The
patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.  The
patient was kept sedated on the night of his surgery.  On the
morning of postoperative day #1 sedation was discontinued.
The patient was weaned from the ventilator and successfully
extubated.  He remained hemodynamically stable with the
assistance of the intra-aortic balloon pump as well as
Neo-Synephrine and Levophed drips.  The patient was also
started on Amiodarone for frequent premature atrial
contractions.  On postoperative day #2, the patient continued
to remain hemodynamically stable.  His intra-aortic balloon
pump was weaned and successfully removed.  Over the next
several days, the patient remained hemodynamically stable.
His pressors were weaned to off with the exception of his
Milrinone which continued to be weaned very slowly and on
postoperative day #5, was ultimately discontinued.  During
this time, gentle diuresis was begun.  Following the
discontinuation of Milrinone, the patient began to be more
vigorously diuresed and his ACE inhibitor was begun.  On
postoperative day #5 the patient doing well and it was
decided that he was stable and ready for transfer to the
floor for continued postoperative care in cardiac
rehabilitation.  At that time the Heart Failure Service was
asked to consult on the patient to add in the care of Mr.
[**Known patient lastname 23015**].  Over the next several days with the assistance of
the nursing staff and physical therapy the patient's activity
level was increased.  He continued to be diuresed.  His
medications were adjusted and he remained hemodynamically
stable, and on postoperative day #10 it was decided that the
patient was stable and ready to be discharged to home the
following morning.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  At the time of discharge the
patient's condition was stable.  His physical examination
revealed vital signs with temperature 97.6, heartrate 90,
sinus rhythm, blood pressure 110/70, respiratory rate 18 and
oxygen saturation 94% on room air.  Weight preoperatively was
78 kg, at discharge 78.1 kg.  Laboratory data revealed white
count 9.7, hematocrit 32.9, platelets 741, sodium 135,
potassium 4.2, chloride 98, carbon dioxide 28, BUN 11,
creatinine 0.7, glucose 183.  Neurological, alert and
oriented times three.  He moves all extremities and follows
commands.  Breathsounds are diminished in the left base but
otherwise clear to auscultation.  Heartsounds, regular rate
and rhythm, S1 and S2, sternum stable.  Incision with
Steri-Strips, open to air, clean and dry.  Abdomen soft,
nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities, warm and well perfused.  The right leg incision
with Steri-Strips, open to air, clean and dry.
