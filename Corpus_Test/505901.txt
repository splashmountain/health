   Assessment and Plan
   59 F with CAD s/p LAD BMS x 2 on [**2913-4-17**], CHF (EF 20%), [**Date Range 6209**] htn and
   asthma recently discharged three days ago now presents with syncope and
   hypotension.
   Syncope and hypotension.
   Likely multifactorial, related to increased diuresis, anti-hypertensive
   medications, and UTI. Her symptoms are improved currently.
   - wean neosynephrine for goal SBP>80
   - cautious 250mL NS bolus prn as needed
   - continue UTI treatment with vancomycin
   - hold diuretics
   - hold antihypertensives
   - currently holding enalapril, spironilactone, metoprolol
   - restart torsemide today and captopril
   CHF
   EF 20% with severe LV dilation and severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 6209**] htn.  Currently
   euvolemic
   - continue prn fluid boluses for SBP > 80
   - hold beta blocker, ACEI, diuretics, and spironolactone given
   hypotension
   - continue digoxin
   - restart torsemide 40mg PO once
   - start captopril instead of enalapril
   UTI/Vaginal burning: Ucx positive for enterococcus from this admission.
   Likely same bacteria as from last culture.
   - continue vancomycin for 7 day course (day 1: [**4-23**])
   - Phenazopyridine for ureteral spasm
   - patient can use vagifem twice weekly per home regimen.
   Coronary Artery Disease
   Recent LAD BMSx2.  She continues to be chest pain free and ECG
   demonstrates no acute changes
   - continue aspirin, statin, and plavix
   - continue to hold beta blocker and ACEI
   ARF
   Most likely secondary to hypovolemia as above. Much improved with fluid
   boluses overnight
   - continue cautious fluid boluses
   - maintain SBP>80
   Rib/Clavicle fx
   Sustained fractures with fall yesterday. Pain currently well controlled
   with only Tylenol.
   - Tylenol prn
   - Sling for comfort
   - appreciate trauma recs
   Depression/Anxiety: Stable
   -Continue venlafaxine, temazepam, buspirone
   Rhythm: sinus.
   - continue telemetry
   .
   Hypothyroidism: stable
   - Continue levothyroxine
   .
   Asthma: currently faint wheezing
   - continue prednisone per home regimen
   - inhalers PRN, advair
   Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:
   Patient is usually on glipizde.
   - hold glipizide for now and use HISS

   Disposition:
   ------ Protected Section ------
   [**Known patient firstname 6233**] had syncope most likely as result of excessive diuresis.  We have
   given back some volume and will restart torsemide at a reduced dose of
   20 mg po bid.  Her other hf meds should be reintroduced one-by-one and
   at time of discharge we should give explicit parameters for holding of
   diuretics (on basis of daily weights) and afterload reducing agents (on
   basis of bp measurement and sx).
