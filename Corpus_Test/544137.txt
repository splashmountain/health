   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is an 82 year old male with CAD s/p CABG and multiple MIs,
   HTN, CHF EF 35%, afib, and sustained VT with ICD and subsequent
   catheter ablation treatment who presents with an episode of ICD firing,
   found to be in slow VT.
   .
   # CAD - The patient has a history of CAD with multiple MIs and
   is medically managed on atorvastatin, metoprolol, and isosorbide
   mononitrate. Will continue home meds for now. Ischemia unlikely as a
   cause for his ICD firing and slow VT however will complete a rule out
   for ACS.
   - cycle CEs
   - monitor on telemetry
   - serial EKGs
   .
   # Pump - Currently euvolemic.  He has chronic systolic heart failure
   with an LVEF of 35%. No active issues.
   - continue home meds
   .
   # Rhythm - The pt is now s/p ICD firing. He was found to be in slow VT
   in the ED. He was able to be paced out of VT. He received a bolus of
   amiodarone and started on a gtt.
   - continue amiodarone gtt
   - monitor on telemetry
   - NPO after MN for possible ablation/EP study in AM, he has had several
   ablation procedures in the past but unclear how successful it may be
   given past unsuccessful attempts, will d/w EP
   - will d/w EP in AM about alternative antiarrhythmic for recurrent VT
   such as flecanide/mexilitine for long term, will d/w outpatient
   cardiologist
   .
   # Hypertension - Continue home meds. No active issues.
   .
   # h/o atrial fibrillation - Currently in sinus rhythm. Will continue
   home meds for now. Heparin gtt, hold Coumadin for now given possibility
   of study, follow INR.
   .
   # h/o DVT - heparin gtt, hold coumadin for now
   .
   # FEN - cardiac healthy diet, NPO after MN for possible EP
   study/ablation
   .
   # Access - PIV
   .
   # Code - full code
