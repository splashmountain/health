   -started ambisome for presumed endovascular fungal infection
   -ophtho evaluated patient for evidence of fungal endopthalmitis. No
   real evidence of fungal infection. But there is a superficial lesion on
   left retina. Very unlikely to be fungal. More likely cotton wool spot
   or myelin. But can't rule out fungus. They'd like to see her again in 2
   weeks.
   -restarted metoprolol 12.5mg po bid
   -CXR:  There is pleural fluid/thickening along the left chest wall,
   more pronounced than on the film from one day earlier. There is
   increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe
   collapse and/or consolidation essentially, unchanged. Hazy opacity at
   right base laterally again noted, unchanged. ? minimal right pleural
   fluid.
    -HCT down to 20.7. Labs suggest hemolysis vs. DIC. Transfused 1u PRBCs
   -poor urine output overnight

   Assessment and Plan
   73F s/p CABG on [**12-24**] complicated by sternal wound infxn, a-fib, and
   respiratory failure requiring trach/PEG returns with bleeding from her
   tracheostomy site and later developed loculated left pleural effusion
   and persistent leukocytosis on tobramycin, tigecycline, and vancomycin.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p Vent 2/09 after surgery. Now with recurrent L.sided pulmonary
   effusions. Consideration are infection-although pleural fluid from [**3-15**]
   without positive cultures; however had elevated WBCs on cell count.
   Sputum growing E.coli and acinetobacter from [**3-7**]. Recent sputum from
   [**3-15**], [**3-18**] growing acinetobacter with same sensitivities of [**3-7**]
   sample. [**3-18**] sputum also growing Ecoli.  Likely other components
   include fluid overload (basilar crackles on exam, gross edema) and
   decompensation. Thoracic and IP services have been involved and have
   bronched and performed thoracentesis.  Increased pleural effusions on
   CT chest on [**3-20**], CXR [**3-25**].
   - Furosemide drip and diuril were restarted 4/28 per Cardiology recs
   with goal diuresis 1-2L/day.  However patient has been hypotensive over
   the last 48 hours. Lasix gtt held overnight. Though appears clinically
   overloaded, may be intravascularly depleted. [**Month (only) 11**] restart lasix gtt and
   diuril this afternoon as blood pressure tolerates to keep patient net
   even.
   - Continue tobramycin, vanc, and tigecycline
   - Cont. surveillance Cx
   - interventional pulmonology/thoracic surgery not planning for repeat
   drainage of left pleural effusion given that she likely would not
   tolerate VATS or thoracotomy. Plan for diuresis, wean pressure support
   as tolerated. Continue abx for aspiration pneumonia, per ID recs.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient continues to be hypotensive requiring dopamine.
   Diltiazem and metoprolol d/c
d  [**3-24**]. Likely secondary to over-diuresis,
   however patient still markedly fluid positive with elevated JVP vs
   infection, although lactate wnl, afebrile.
   -restart diuresis with lasix gtt as blood pressure tolerates with goal
   of net even
   -fluid bolus as blood pressure necessitates
   -lactate wnl
   -weaned off dopamine
   - restart metoprolol 12.5mg
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever
   Likely related to pulmonary etiology.  BCx grew coag negative staph
   from [**3-18**], likely contaminant. On tobramycin and tigecycline
   following. C Diff. negative x 3 ([**3-12**], 23, 26).  Now with Klebsiella in
   urine, resistant to tobramycin.  Sputum culture still growing
   Acinetobacter and Ecoli from [**3-18**], despite abx.  UCx growing highly
   resistant klebsiella, resistant to tobramycin. Repeat UA growing [**4-2**]
   WBCs. Echo [**3-24**] showed small vegetation, ? fungal, no persistent
   bacteremia or fungemia. Worsening sternal wound noted [**3-26**].
   - Continue tobramycin (day 13), tigecycline (day 14), and vancomycin
   per ID recs. Total course of Tobra and Tigecycline is 3 weeks for
   pneumonia.
   -Continue ambisome (day 2) for presumed endovascular fungal infection
   -reconsult optho [**4-9**] to re-eval for fungal endophthalmitis
   - Appreciate ongoing infectious disease consult input will discuss with
   ID antifungals, given that currently we are continuing aggressive
   treatment
   -recheck C diff
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Follow-up trend fever curve/WBCs
   .
   . # Cardiac:
   History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and new onset atrial
   fibrillation post-operatively. Is not currently anticoagulated. Had
   been in sinus rhythm until atrial fibrillation [**3-18**].  A fib c/ RVR
   initially controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem but now both being
   held in setting of hypotension.  Also volume overloaded echo
   demonstrating moderate aortic regurgitation and mild to mod mitral
   regurg. Moderate pulmonary HTN. Cardiology recommended aggressive
   diuresis given fluid overload. Overall LOS 7.5 L positive. However this
   is being held in the setting of hypotension.
   - restart lasix/diuril diuresis this afternoon
   - Continue amiodarone, asa, statin
   - Dilt d/c
d for hypotension.
   -restart metoprolol this AM at low dose. Titrate up for HR control as
   BP tolerates.
   .
   # Anemia: HCT 23.2, despite 1u PRBCs overnight. HCT yesterday 21.3.
   Continues to be hypotensive, but no active signs of bleeding. INR 2.0
   for unclear reasons. No known liver disease. [**Month (only) 11**] be nutritional.
   -guaiac stools
   -Vit K 5mg x3 doses
   -d/c-ed lovenox given renal failure and anemia
   -make sure patient has active T&S
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine elevated from 0.8 to 1.4.  Patient
   had dye loads last week for CT scan.  Possibly ATN in the setting of
   dye load vs prerenal in the setting of over diuresis. FE urea 52.4,
   suggesting ATN as likely etiology.
   -redose medications, especially Vancomycin and Tobramycin
   -continue to monitor Cr
   -avoid further nephrotoxins
