He was afebrile.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.  The
extraocular movements were intact.  The oropharynx was
benign.  The neck was supple with full range of motion.
There was no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Carotids were 2
plus and equal bilaterally with no bruits.  The lungs had
diffuse rales half the way up bilaterally.  The abdomen was
soft and nontender.  There were positive bowel sounds.  There
were no masses or hepatosplenomegaly.  The extremities were
without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  The pulses were 2 plus
and equal bilaterally throughout.  The neurologic examination
was nonfocal.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on [**7-21**] which revealed the left main was
normal.  The left anterior descending had diffuse moderate
proximal and mid disease.  The left circumflex had an ostial
80 percent lesion.  The right coronary artery had an ostial
50 percent lesion.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted, and on [**7-22**] the patient
underwent a coronary artery bypass graft times three with a
left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending,
reversed saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending
artery and obtuse marginal.  Cross-clamp time was 64 minutes.
Total bypass time was 85 minutes.  The patient was
transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit in stable
condition on propofol, nitroglycerin, and Neo-Synephrine.  He
was extubated on his postoperative night.

On postoperative day one, he was in stable condition.  He had
his chest tubes discontinued on postoperative day two.  He
was AV-paced at 90, and that was slowly weaned off.  He then
went into rapid atrial fibrillation.  He was started on
Lopressor and amiodarone and converted to a sinus rhythm.

The patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day
three.  He kept an occasional heart rate in the 50s and 60s,
and had his amiodarone decreased down to 200 once per day.
He had his wires discontinued on postoperative day three.

On postoperative day five, he was bradycardic down to the
30s.  His blood pressure was around 90.  He was transferred
to back to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit for observation.
His Lopressor was discontinued and his amiodarone was
discontinued.  He was seen by Electrophysiology who
recommended him to be discharged on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 852**] of Hearts monitor
and just followed for bradycardia.  His heart rate over the
next day rebounded to the 70s and 80s with a good blood
pressure, and he was transferred back to the floor in stable
condition.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  On postoperative day six, he was
discharged to rehabilitation in stable condition.

LABORATORY DATA ON DISCHARGE:  His laboratories on discharge
revealed a hematocrit of 30.2, his white blood cell count was
6600, his platelets were 183,000.  Sodium was 141, potassium
was 4.1, chloride was 102, bicarbonate was 31, blood urea
nitrogen was 52, creatinine was 1.8, and blood glucose was
126.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Lasix 20 mg by mouth twice per day (for seven days).
2. Potassium 20 mEq by mouth twice per day (for seven days).
3. Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
4. Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
5. Percocet one to two tablets by mouth q.4-6h. as needed
   (for pain).
6. Plavix 75 mg by mouth once per day (for three months).
