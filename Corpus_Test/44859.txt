Chief Complaint:
NSTEMI; ASA desensitization prior to cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization [**2913-4-17**]

History of Present Illness:
This is a 59 year-old female with a history of non ischemic
dilated cardiomyopathy EF 20-25% followed by HF clinic at
[**Hospital1 2046**] who was admitted to NEBH 3/309 with progressively
worsening SOB since [**2913-1-9**], diaphoresis and chest pain.
She was found to be in heart failure with elevated BNP and ruled
in for NSTEMI with troponin I 5.97 peak, CK 212, CKMB 5.1 index
2.4. She was diuresed, started on nitro gtt and heparin gtt and
underwent cardiac cath [**2913-4-14**] with 2VD with 50% proximal and 50%
mid LAD stenosis as well as 70-80% stenosis distal RCA. Heparin
gtt d/c'd at 0800. Due to reaction of anaphylaxis with ASA she
was transferred here for ASA desensitization and PCI. She report
continued SOB and diaphoresis which has been present since
[**Month (only) 728**] and was precipitaed by flu like illness. She denies any
current chest pain buit has had intermittent epigastric
discomfort typically relieved with maalox. She reports
exertional dyspnea, PND, orthopnea. Symptoms have been
progressive x months but acutely worsened 1 week prior to
transfer one day after lasix dose decreased from 80 [**Hospital1 **] to daily
ad dig stopped [**3-13**] concern for dig toxicity. ALso has had
dietary indiscretion with poor PO intake but eating low sodium
soup and saltines.

Reports/Imaging
ECG [**2913-4-14**]: Sinus tachycardia. Left atrial enlargement.
Occasional ventricular ectopy.  Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Right axis deviation. Downsloping ST segment depression and T
wave inversion in leads V4-V6 which may be left ventricular
hypertrophy related. Lateral ischemia cannot be excluded. No
previous tracing available for comparison. Clinical correlation
of the right axis deviation and ST-T wave changes is suggested.


CXR [**2913-4-15**]: REASON FOR EXAM: 59-year-old woman with CHF admitted
with shortness of breath and chest pain, please evaluate for
infiltrate or effusion.
Since [**2910-3-17**], moderate left and small right pleural
effusions are new with bibasilar opacity, likely atelectasis.
Heart size is difficult to assess. There are no signs of edema.
Scoliosis is unchanged.
.
Cardiac cath [**2913-4-17**] COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography revealed two vessel CAD.  The
LM was angiographically normal. The LCX was angiographically
normal.  The LAD had a mid 70-80% hazy lesion and the mid-distal
LAD had a 70% lesion.  The RCA had moderate diffuse distal
disease but the discrete lesion seen on Friday was clearly no
longer evident.  There was evidence of distal embolization with
slow flow in RPL.
2.  Limited hemodynamics with BP 83/55 with HR 83 in sinus.  We
gave
500cc NS bolus.  Right heart cath was deferred.
3. Stenting of LAD with Vision 3x8 and 3x12mm bare metal stents.

4. Groin closure with Mynx device
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe cardiomyopathy with EF 20% and cardiac index 1.3 on
Friday
3. NSTEMI involving RCA territory.
4. Stenting of LAD.

Echo [**2913-4-18**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to akinesis of the entire
interventricular septum and inferior free wall and severe
hypokinesis of the anterior free wall and apex. The posterior
wall contracts normally and the lateral wall is only mildly
hypokinetic. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler
and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV
(severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The mitral valve
leaflets do not fully coapt due to posterior and apical
tethering of the leaflets. An eccentric, posteriorly directed
jet of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: severe, multifocal left ventricular contractile
dysfunction with severe chamber enlargement, severe mitral
regurgitation, preserved posterior wall contractile function,
moderate pulmonary hypertension, and moderate-to-severe
tricuspid regurgitation


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 59F with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy
admitted with progressive SOB and intermittent CP with
borderline elevated biomarkers at OSH transferred for ASA
desensitization and PCI.
.
#. ASA desensitization: Patient completed ASA desensitization
[**2913-4-15**] per protocol with solumedrol, benadryl and singulair
prior to desensitization. She was subsequently continued on ASA
325 PO daily which she tolerated. She did not have any adverse
reactions to ASA desensitization.
.
#. CAD/Chest pain: Pt found to have 2VD on cardiac cath at OSH.
She had echo without focal WMA so unclear if 2VD is true
etiology of her current symptoms. EKG changes and elevated
biomarkers may also be c/w strain. Since it was felt that her
symptoms may benefit from intervention, she was taken to cath
lab on [**2913-4-17**]. Her RCA was not found to be occluded at the time
and findings were consistent with recent lysis and embolization
of an RCA thrombus. The LAD, however, was found to have approx
70%-80% stenosis. She had BMS x 2 to LAD. Subsequently, she was
continued on ASA 325, plavix 75 daily, statin, imdur, beta
blocker.
.
#. Pump: Pt has longstanding history of non-ischemic dilated CM
of unknown etiology with EF 20-25% with severe global HK.
Symptoms over last several months most c/w  decompensated
systolic and diastolic heart failure. Possible exacerbating
factors include medication changes (lasix dose decreased by
half), dietary indiscretion and recent viral illness with
increased demand. From echo here, it is also possible that her
longstanding history of cardiomyopathy may have been ischemic
after all, although it is difficult to tell now. She was
diuresed for net negative 1-2 liters per day, intially with IV
lasix 40 IV BID then with 80 lasix IV BID. We considered
titrated heart failure therapy with Swan ganz catheter due to
severity of elevated wedge and low CI at OSH cath but did not
feel it was neccessary since she was responding well to lasix IV
[**Date Range 838**] and was comfortable on room air with sats in mid 90s. Per
notes, she is not candidate for heart transplant [**3-13**] pulm HTN
and has refused ICD in past. Per OSH records she had elevated
Dig level prior to admission. Dig level 0.6 here. Dig was
restarted. She was continued on Aldactone, beta blocker, ACE.
We attempted changing metoprolol to carvedilol but pt had
increased wheezing with carvedilol so changed back to
metoprolol. Diuretic regimen changed from furosemide to
torsemide atr discharge for improved heart failure management
and diuresis.
.
#.Leukocytosis: Pt had mild leukocytosis with complaints of
urinary dysuria and mildly dirty UA. Foley catheter was d/c'd.
Urine culture grew enterococcus but U/A negative and pt without
symptoms so antibiotics were not started at discharge.
Leukocytosis may have been partially related to steroids.
.
#. Rhythm: Sinus. Continued beta blocker.
.
#. Asthma: Pt has h/o increased bronchospasm with ASA in past.
She tolerated ASA well without exacerbation of asthma symptoms.
Continued outpatient regimen of advair, nebs, predisone 5mg PO
daily.
.
#. Anxiety/Depression: Continued Celexa, valium, buspar
.
#. Hypothyrodism: Continued synthroid. TSH WNL
.
#. Code: Full
