   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR who was admitted
   with pneumonia, hypoxia and respiratory distress. Being treated for
   VAP/aspiration PNA.
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C and not tolerating
   attempts at pressure support this morning. Likely cause is HAP vs
   aspiration PNA. Patient has a left sided PNA and pleural effusion (
   mostly right side).  Continues to have generous secretions.
   - continue on current settings A/C,  recheck ABG
    - continue broad Abx: meropenem [**7-8**],  vanc [**9-7**], Cipro [**7-8**]
    - plan for pleural tap of effusion on right today
 will send fluid
   for cytology and cultures
   #Leukocytosis:  WBC on rise over past 2-3 days and is up to 16-17
   range. Source may be PNA vs. stage III ducubitus ulcer or c.difficile.
   Although infrequent bowel movements places C.diff low on differential.
   No current fevers. Lactate up to 2 from 1 range.
   -  CIS
    - cont f/u all culture data
    - cont [**Last Name (un) **]/cipro/ vanco coverage as above
   # VAP: RML &  RLL infiltrate felt to be from likely aspiration.
   Fevers better but still elevated WBCs as above.
   - continue  vanc (d1=[**4-30**], today d8),  [**Last Name (un) **] (d1=[**5-2**], today d6), cipro
   (d1=[**5-2**], today d6)
 plan is for a full 10 day course
   - tapping and culturing R sided effusion today
   - f/u pending micro/ Cx data
   - consider checking glucan/galactomannan if no significant improvement
   though note pt recently on zosyn so may be false po
   # Hypotension
   Likely due to sepsis with pulmonary source, as above. Lactates have
   trended down. Baseline critical AS. Have started gentle diuresis with
   lasix gtt overnight. Has had good UOP
   - Keep on levophed with goal diuresis 1L out/24hrs, keeping MAP>65
   - Follow urine output, MAPS
   .
   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   AVR had been on hold given infection and question of HIT
   - readdress with cardiac surgery. ?role for valvuloplasty
   - control tachycardia as per above to improve filling time
   - lasix gtt with goal UOP 100cc/hr, goal -1L out overnight
   - PM lytes with diuresis
   # ?HIT:
   Felt unlikely on rediscussion with heme, though unable to completely
   rule out at this time. Repeat PF4 mildly elevated.
   - heme recs appreciated
 get thoughts on HIT in context of cardiac
   surgery
   - continue to hold lepirudin
   # atrial tachycardia:
   triggered by hypoxia, > 50% of time in the ICU has been in atrial
   tachycardia, has been converted to PO amiodarone
   - continue PO amiodarone
   - can back off on diuresis if tachycardia increased
   #. ARF:
   Cr stable
   - trend cr and monitor UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   # Coagulapathy
   DDx include DIC, antibiotics, poor nutrition. INR mildly improved after
   vitamin K.
   - hold on FFP for now.
   - check fibrinogen
   .
   # Volume status- will plan to diuresed with lasix gtt, goal 500 to
   1000cc negative
