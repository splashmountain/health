.
EKG: NSR at ~75 bpm, normal axis, normal intervals. Q wave in
III, q wave in AVF. No ST changes.
.
Cath [**3211-7-22**]: Selective coronary angiography in this right
dominant system revealed flow limiting epicardial coronary
artery disease.  The LMCA was a long vessel with no apparent
obstruction.  The LAD had a promixal 85% stenosis and then a 40%
stenosis more distally.  The LCx had a 50% mid stenosis.  The
RCA had an ostial 70% stenosis. Left ventriculography revealed a
grossly normal ejection fraction. We were unable to calculate
LVEF because a calibration image was not obtained. Central
aortic pressure was 126/56.
.
CT Scan Abd/Pelvis, +/- contrast, [**3211-7-22**]: Asymmetry of the
distal rectal wall. A malignancy cannot be excluded and physical
exam/ proctoscopy is recommended for further evaluation. Two
hypoattenuating subcentimeter lesions in the liver, too small to

characterize. Multiple hypoattenuating lesions in both kidneys,
most of which are too small to characterize. 2.8 x 2.5 cm simple
cyst in the right right kidney in the upper pole. Prominent fat
at ileocecal valve, most likely anormal variant. Extensive
diverticulosis involving the sigmoid colon, transverse colon,
and ascending colon, without evidence of diverticulitis. Exam
not tailored for detection of colon cancer and dedicated
colonoscopy or virtual CT colonoscopy would be necessary for
this purpose if colon cancern is suspected clinically.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 74 year old woman with chest discomfort on
exertion in the setting of microcytic anemia, requiring cardiac
clearance prior to colonoscopy for workup of the anemia. She had
cardiac catheterization on [**3211-7-22**], which showed three-vessel
disease. She was continued on beta-blocker and aspirin from the
outside hospital, and started on high dose Lipitor. She received
one transfusion while on the cardiology service, and her
hematocrit was stable ~31. She had one CT of abdomen/pelvis,
which was non-specific, showing thickening of the rectal wall
and several hypodense sub-centimeter lesions in the kidneys and
liver, but ruling out largely metastatic disease. It was decided
to get an EGD/colonoscopy, which showed mild gastritis and an
adenomatous polyp in the ascending colon. She was transferred to
the cardiothoracic surgery team on Tuesday [**7-26**] for coronary
bypass grafting.

Her post-operative course was unremarkable.  She progressed
quickly with physical therapy, had walked up a flight of stairs
by POD # 2.  Her epicardial wires were removed on POD # 3, and
she has remained hemodynamically stable throughout her post-op
stay.  She is ready to be discharged home today.
