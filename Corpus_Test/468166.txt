Chief Complaint:  Bacteremia
   HPI:
   The patient is a 75y/o M with a PMH of CAD s/p CABG with AVR in [**3446**]
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for management of suspected endocarditis. On
   arrival to [**Hospital1 5**] the patient is unable to fully relate his HPI. Limited
   history is taken from OSH DC Summary and admission note. The patientwas
   in his usual state of health, living independently who presented to
   [**Hospital 663**] hospital [**3-27**] after being found unresponsive by his daughter
   with tachypnea and fever. He had previously complained of [**3-14**] days of
   general malaise. He was taken to the ED, where he was found to be
   hypotensive with a BP 85/49 and temp of 102. He was started on
   Vancomycin/Zosyn. CXR per reports was suggestive of CHF with bilateral
   infiltrates. He was also started on stress dose  hydrocortisone given
   history of prednisone therapy for RA. He was admitted to the [**Hospital1 663**]
   ICU and started on pressors after receiving a few small fuid boluses
   per report. Swan-ganz catheter was placed and he was found to have a
   wedge of 26. He was given an unclear amount of diuretics as well as an
   attempt at Bipap. Per report blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus
   and zosyn was disontinued. TTE was completed on day of transfer however
   was not read. Per nursing reports he was intermittently requiring
   dopamine and neosynephrine for intermittent hypotension. At the time of
   transfer he was continued on levophed 5mcg/kg/min, dopamine
   2.5mcg/kg/min. Per report he also briefly required sedation with
   Precedex for agitation however he was never intubated.
   .
   On arrival to the CCU, the patient is sleepy but easily arousable and
   conversant. He is oriented to hospital and name but not to date. He
   currently denies chest pain and shortness of breath. Denies headache,
   vision changes. Denies abdominal pain, hemoptysis, black or red stools.
   He reports a history of bleeding and bruising of unknown etiology,
   states he has had bleeding of his nose and gums previously which
   resolved without intervention.

   aureus bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic CHF
   .
   # Bacteremia - The patient was found to have 4/4 bottles growing
   Staphylococcus aureus. Concern for endovascular source of infection
   given high grade bacteremia. No clear portal of entry as the patient
   denies recent procedures/dental work, no focal symptoms. Given his
   presentation with community acquired bacteremia with symptoms of [**3-14**]
   day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for complicated
   bacteremia, including endocarditis. By Duke Criteria - he has major
   criteria of high gradebacteremia with typical organism, by minor
   criteria he has fever, predisposing heart condition, he also has skin
   findings of petechiae however difficult to interpret in the setting of
   significant thrombocytopenia.
   - Will continue Vancoymcin dosed 1 gm Q 12
   - Contact[**Name (NI) **] OSH micro lab - SA is likely MSSA but sensitivities are not
   finalized, will fax results in am - if so, plan to transition to
   nafcillin
   - Would opt for TEE in am given bioprosthetic aortic valve
   - If evidence of vegetation or new/worsening valvular dysfunction,
   consider addition of gentamicin/rifamplin for S. aureus prosthetic
   valve endocarditis
   - Will obtain surveillance blood cultures
   - ID consult in am given high grade Staph aureus bacteremia
   .
   # Hypotension - Presentation of hypotension in setting of bacteremia
   could be consistent with sepsis, however the patient has a mixed
   picture given PCWP of 32 and CVP 14-24. Also consider worsening aortic
   valvular function in the setting of endocarditis. Currently, the
   patient appears volume overloaded with elevated JVP. Per reports
   pressor requirements have decreased since beginning diuresis. Current
   CVP 16 with PAP 66/29
   - Continue to taper dopamine/neosynephrine
   - Will diureses with IV lasix
   - Treat bacteremia as above
   - TEE as above to evaluate EF/valvular dysfunction
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF - Pt currently with evidence of volume
   overload as above
   - Diurese with lasix goal 1L negative but will follow hemodynamics and
   Cr
   - Plan for beta blocker and ACE-I once BP allows
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency
   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia however in setting of
   acute infection, must consider. HIT also unlikely given documented long
   history of thrombocytopenia.
   - Will check LFTs/Bili/LDH
   - Check Fibrinogen
   - Check B12/folate
   - Trend INR
   - Check peripheral smear
   - Consider hematology consult in am
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter - the pt reports a history of AF
   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter however this is in the setting of
   pressors
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Elevated CK/Troponin - No prior ECG for comparison, no clear
   ischemia. Trop bump most likely occurred in the setting of hypotension
   secondary to infection
   - Repeat CK/Trop
   - TTE in am as above
   - Continue statin
   - Start BB and ACE-I as BP allows
   .
   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection as above
   - Check LFTs, Ca
   - Obatin read of Head CT
   .
   FEN: Low Na, diabetic diet, NPO in am for possible TEE
   .
   ACCESS: R CVL/PA catheter - will need to change in am as placed at OSH
   .
