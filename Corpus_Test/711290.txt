   Assessment and Plan
   38M with NHL s/p alloBMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and BO with
   severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention, presented with dyspnea
   and cough on [**3264-2-14**], now day 8 in [**Hospital Unit Name 42**] for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, intubated, but tolerating PS for several hours a day.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure - Likely multifactorial [**2-5**] to GVHD,
   bronchiolitis obliterans. Completed 8 day course for VAP.  Doing
   progressively better with PSV during the day.  Plan for SBT and
   possible extubation today.
   - Decrease prednisone to 20mg PO daily
   - Lasix 20mg IV PRN, goal negative 0.5L daily
   - SBT tomorrow, possible extubation.  If he cannot tolerate this, will
   reintubate and plan for trach Monday.
   .
   # Liver cirrhosis/ascites - Likely secondary to GVHD c/b portal HTN,
   esophageal varices, ascites.  Could complicate approach for PEG
   placement, but thoracic surgery did not feel therapeutic paracentesis
   was necessary given moderate ascites.  No paracentesis for now
   - Lasix 20mg IV PRN: diuresis
   - Trend LFT
s, coags
   - consider Dobhoff placement, d/w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2183**] given varices
   # Depression: In the context of prolonged ICU course and need for
   further interventions. Not seen by SW on this admission.
   - Discuss SW visit with patient today
   # Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p allo BMT, GVHD: Most recent PET scan with
   no evidence of recurrent disease. Patient remains in remission.
   - Monitor counts and toxicities
   - Cellcept 250mg PO BID
   - Bactrim DS 1 tab M/W/F
   - Acyclovir 400mg q8H
   - Prednisone 20mg PO daily
   - f/u BMT recs
   # Anemia: Stable. Hct 30.0 -> 28.7 today. Mildly iron deficient, normal
   b12/folate, but normal Hct prior to this hospitalization. [**Month (only) 56**] be [**2-5**]
   liver disease causing occult GI losses from hemorrhoids/varices and
   anemia of chronic inflammation. No clear trigger for hemolysis.
   - Trend Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   # Elevated PTT: Mildly elevated 38.1, PT/INR normal.
   - continue SC Heparin 2500u TID
   - hold heparin for procedure
   # Hypothyroidism: Normal TSH & free T4 from [**1-/3264**]
   - Continue Levothyroxine 125mcg PO daily
   # Gastric varices:  Currently normotensive
   - Continue Metoprolol 12.5 mg PO BID
   # Anxiety
   - ativan prn
   # Hypotension: BP slightly decreased this am.  Could be related to vent
   weaning.
