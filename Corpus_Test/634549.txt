   Assessment and Plan
   66F with CAD, PVD, ESRD s/p DCD renal tx in [**2576**] now with NSTEMI and
   severe abdominal pain.
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Improved this AM.  No longer diffusely tender.  DDx
   includes: intestinal ischemia, (possible given PVD and recent NSTEMI,
   given diffuse athermatous plaques within the aorta, patient likely
   sensitive to low flow state, acute mesenteric ischemia less likely as
   lactate wnl and no findings c/w acute ischemia on CT abdomen), anginal
   equivalent (possible, as patient presenting in the setting of NSTEMI
   with positive CEs; however, enzymes now trending down and patient
   continues to have pain), severe constipation (possible as patient has
   history of chronic constipation, and recent hospital admission [**1-27**]
   constipation), obstruction [**1-27**] to malignancy, mass, ileus (patient has
   long standing history of constipation, but less likely given normal
   colonoscopy in [**4-3**] and no evidence of obstruction on stat CT abdomen),
   acute cholecystitis, acute cholangitis, (significant pain in RUQ,
   distended gb on CT and US, but unlikely given afebrile, normal WBC,
   LFTs and no evidence of acute disease on CT or US done at OSH). Acute
   abdomen unlikely given lack of peritoneal signs, benign CT.
   - consider acute on chronic bowel ischemia, as lactate is now rising
   - evaluation for bowel ischemia would be angiography
   - Continue bowel regimen with soap suds enemas PRN, senna, colace
   - F/u final read CT abdomen
   - Surgery following patient, patient w/o acute abdomen right now
   - Currently on diluadid PRN pain control, but given hypomotility
   effects, consider using fentanyl which is the least constipating [**Doctor Last Name **].
   - Continue to monitor abdominal exam for peritoneal signs.
   - Continue to trend lactate q6 for signs of ischemia
   - Consider gentle IVF to treat low grade ischemia; however, use caution
   given recent drop in EF
   - if lactate > 2.5, call surgery
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with h/o CAD, with stress test in [**2581**] some
   anterior apical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia, with
   echo at OSH showing anteroapical akinesis, CE peaked to troponin 5.07,
   MB 40.04, presenting with NSTEMI, with newly decreased EF to 45%. Was
   given 300 mg dose of plavix on arrival
   - Nitro gtt did not help with pain
   - d/c heparin gtt today as CE trending down,
   - start plavix 75 mg
   - continue ASA 325
   - continue atorvastatin 80 mg
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 7**] as tolerated by HR
   - possible cath lab today, however patient with renal failure
   .
   # PUMP: Bedside echo from [**2583-8-20**] showing EF of 45%, decreased from 60%
   4/09,may be [**1-27**] to NSTEMI, marked pulmonary HTN, estimated pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure was 74, 1+ MR, may be [**1-27**] to history of
   diastolic dysfunction, MR. Received 40 mg IV lasix with minimal
   output.
   - lasix 80mg IV x 1 today.  Monitor UOP.
   - Patient has allergy to [**Last Name (LF) 9529**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] clarify reaction today
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Consider right heart cath to eval pulmonary HTN
   - Lasix 20 mg IV as pt with signs of volume overload
   - ECHO today
   .
   # RHYTHM: has history of PAF, s/p failed cardioversion x 2, on long
   term coumadin, INR 1.5 on admission. On tele, patient is intermittently
   in A. fib, intermittently sinus, rate 70s-85. Patient has history of
   bradyarrhythmia, INR 5.1 on admission
   - Received vitamin K 2.5 mg SQ on admission
   - Off coumadin until INR [**1-28**]
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg PO BID, as tolerated by HR
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   # ESRD [**1-27**] DMII/HTN, s/p DCD renal transplant in [**2576**], on
   immunosuppresion therapy, Cr 2.9 on admission, around baseline of [**1-28**]
   since [**2-1**], pending this AM
   -discontinue [**Last Name (un) **] today
   - may be getting transplant sclerosis
   - Transplant team recs today re: cath lab in light of chronic renal
   insufficiency
   - Continue immunosuppresive agents
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: ABG @ 3 am 7.24/41/55 HCO3 18
   Gap calculated to be 20 from BMP @ 9:45 pm. Mostly likely etiology is
   renal, given history of renal insufficiency. Also on the differential
   is lactic acidosis, possible given recent NSTEMI, and severe abdominal
   pain that may be [**1-27**] to ischemia. Lactate level has been wnl at 1.5,
   however. Venous BG from this AM 7.13/53/104, HCO3 19, results appear
   more consistent with ABG. Other less likely etiologies of anion gap
   metabolic acidosis include toxic ingestions, which this patient denies.
   - Repeat VBG
   - Start maintainane IVF with D5 with 3 amps HCO3
   - Continue to monitor lactate levels
   .
   # DMII, c/b neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy: BSGlu 155, continue
   SSI
   .
   #  Hypertension: Hypertensive to SBPs 160s on admission, normalized on
   nitro gtt, gtt d/c'd. Currently normotensive
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg po BID
   - Lasix prn
   - Hold home hydralazine, clonidine, amlodopine
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: check TSH, continue synthroid 88 mcg

   # GERD:  Protonix 40 mg po Qday
