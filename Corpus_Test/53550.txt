Chief Complaint:
slow ventricular tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ventricular Tachycardia Ablation
Right Atrial Lead Placement Device Upgrade


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 1978**] was an 82 year old retired dermatologist with h/o
remote anterior MI with a resultant LV aneurysm/scar with an
LVEF of 25-30%.  He has had intermittent symptoms of congestive
heart failure, easily treated with diuretics. He also has a
history of chronic recurrent slow monomorphic ventricular
tachycardia and is s/p ICD implant in [**3463**].  In prior years, his
VT had not caused any syncope and he would experience one or two
ICD firings per year. Over the past several months, he has had
several episodes where he has had syncope or presyncope, with
episodes lasting minutes at a time. In [**4-/3477**] he was admitted to
his local hospital in [**State 400**] for recurrent syncope and ICD
firing. His workup included a cardiac catheterization. His LAD
was found chronically occluded with collaterals from the RCA.
His OM was stented with a bare metal stent.

On [**3477-5-27**] the patient was readmitted to Palm Beach Gardens
Medical Center with recurrent near syncope that lasted 2
minutes. On arrival he was noted to have mild CHF. He had some
slow VT on the monitor but it did not trigger his ICD. His
Amiodarone was increased to 400mg b.i.d. and Mexiletine dosing
increased to 150mg t.i.d. Since that time he has not had any
further events. His Amiodarone has been cut back to 300mg b.i.d.
He is now being referred for VT ablation.

Pt underwent VT ablation on [**6-7**], which found two circuits
exiting near the rim of the LV aneurysm. Both VTs were
successfully ablated. Upon arrival to the CCU, the patient
denied chest pain or shortness of breath. He was hemodynamically
and electrically stable. I told the family of the benefits of
atrial pacing to improve his hemodynamics and said we could do
an upgrade next week or the week after. The patient and his
family preferred that the upgrade be done the next day, if
possible, since it would be inconvenient to go back and forth
from the hospital.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**3477-6-7**] at 3:15:44 PM      FINAL
IMPRESSION: Very small pericardial effusion near the
inferolateral wall of the left ventricle without
echocardiographic evidence of tamponade. Biatrial enlargement.
Severe global and regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
in the presence of a large apical aneurysm. Mild to moderate
aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Tricuspid
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**3477-6-8**] at 1:22:06 PM
FINAL

There is an apical left ventricular aneurysm. There is no
pericardial effusion. The Impella catheter is seen in the left
ventricle extending to the apical aneurysm, penetrating deeper
into the left ventricular cavity than would be expected to
provide effective circulatory support. Device was pulled back
under fluoroscopic guidance.

     Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**3477-6-8**] at 4:27:40 PM
  FINAL

There is an apical left ventricular aneurysm. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Tip of Impella catheter seen at midventricular level, abutting
inferior posterior wall. Brisk Impella outflow seen in proximal
ascending aorta. Left ventricular end diastolic chamber
dimension (4.0 cm) suggests adequate volume unloading.

IMPRESSION:
1. Small to moderate amount of intrapelvic blood as well as
stranding
surrounding the access site. Moderate amount of blood in the
anterior
pericardial fat space that tracts down to the level of the mid
abdomen on the right.
2. Calcified splenic granulomas.
3. Small non-obstructing renal stone in the right kidney.
4. Small liver cyst and smaller subcentimeter adjacent
hypodensity which is too small to characterize.


CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**3477-6-7**] 1:59 PM

There is moderate cardiomegaly. Left pacemaker lead terminates
in the right ventricle. There is no pneumothorax or large
pleural effusion. There are low lung volumes. There is mild
vascular congestion. There are bibasilar atelectases.

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of [**3477-6-8**] 4:07 PM

FINDINGS: Bilateral, severe pulmonary edema is new since
yesterday. An
orogastric tube courses just below the diaphragm with its side
port still
above the level of GE junction, consider advancing the
orogastric tube by 6 cm for a better seating. Endotracheal tube
tip is 8 cm above the carina ending approximately at the level
of the clavicular head, consider advancing the endotracheal tube
by 2-3 cm for better seating. There is a left pectoral ICD
device with two leads coursing through the left transvenous
approach and right transvenous approach and ending into the
right atrium and right ventricle respectively. There is no
evidence of pneumothorax. An Impella device through the aorta
ends into the left ventricle.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 1978**] was an 82 year old man with anterior wall MI
approximately 40 years ago with LV aneurysm/scar, s/p bare metal
stenting of the OM [**3477-4-26**], recurrent slow monomorphic VT with
single chamber ICD implant [**3463**], generator replacement in [**3468**]
and [**3473**], MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], pHTN, presented s/p VT ablation on [**6-7**],
which was performed because of recent symptomatic VT and ICD
firings.  He was taken back to the EP lab on [**3477-6-8**] for RA lead
placement and device upgrade, during wich he had a cardiac
arrest and prolonged resuscitation resulting in cardiogenic
shock, multisystem organ failure, and eventually to his death.

# Cardiac Arrest
Patient had a PEA arrest in the EP lab on [**3477-6-8**] after RA lead
placement, unclear precipitant.  Mechanical and pharmacologic
CPR resulted in VF which was defibrillated twice with a round of
CPR in between.  An Impella device was placed by Interventional
Cardiology team to offload the LV.  He had increasing pressor
requirement over next several hours, maxed out on three
pressors.  Lactate was rising, likely in setting of poor
perfusion and also question of abdominal compartment syndrome,
potentially from intrapelvic bleed post-procedurally.  He had
been transfused a total of 6 units of blood, 2 units FFP, 1 unit
platelets, 1 unit cryoglobulin peri-procedurally in setting of
DIC in cath lab, which had resolved by arrival to CCU.

Combination of progressive cardiogenic shock with acute anuric
renal failure resulted in progressive hypoxemic respiratory
failure with increasing difficulty oxygenating on ventilator.
Patient did not respond to IV diuretics and continued to have
worsening hemodynamics with systolic blood pressure in the 70's
despite maximum pressors and impella support.  Family was
notified and present at bedside, made decision not to proceed
with CRRT/CVVH due to his deteriorating condition and overall
poor prognosis.  Patient was made comfort measures and Impella
device was turned off.

# Slow monomorphic VT:
Patient had single chamber ICD implant from [**3463**], generator
replacement in [**3468**] and [**3473**], and underwent VT ablation on [**6-7**]
because of recent symptomatic VT and ICD firings. Pt was
transiently hypotensive to 70s during VT ablation and received
prophylactic chest compressions (less than 30 sec) but even
though he maintained an adequate pulse.  He was noted to have
markedly improved hemodynamics with atrial pacing or sinus
rhythm, which was facilitated by dopamine. Throughout the
remainder of the case he was hemodynamically stable with BPs in
115-145 range. His VTs were non-inducible at the end of the
procedure and he was extubated without complication. Because his
native sinus rhythm was at rates in 40s (due to prior high
dosing with amiodarone), he was started on low dose dopamine
overnight to overdrive underlying slow VT.  Per the patient's
and family's wishes, he was taken back to the EP lab [**3477-6-8**] for
RA lead placement and device upgrade, during which he arrested,
as above.
