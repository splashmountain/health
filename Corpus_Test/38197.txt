Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 215**]
Chief Complaint:
NSTEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization, 2 stents to LAD and LCX


History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Name13 (STitle) 1892**] is a 57 year old woman with HLD, GERD, ? HTN who
presented via EMS status post cardiac arrest to [**Location (un) **] and
transferred to [**Hospital1 4**] for cardiac catheterization.
.
Per ED records, patient called EMS for substernal chest pain and
shortness of breath.  On EMS arrival, patient was conscious but
then she passed out.  She arrested infront of EMS and received 2
shocks by AED.  She regained consciousness with reported normal
mental status.  Enroute, she arrested again and was shocked
again.  She got 300mg of amio by EMS.  Rhythm strips reportedly
showed torsades.  At [**Location (un) **], she was again, awake, but
intubated for airway protection.  She received aspirin 325mg,
plavix 600mg, heparin gtt, amiodarone gtt and integrillin.  An
ECG showed heart rate 63, STD in v1-3 with concern for posterior
STEMI.
.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 4**] for cath lab.  In cath lab, her she
had proximal 95% LAD and mid 95% LCx oclusion that were stented.
 She was also noted to have markedly elevated filling pressures
and received lasix.

CATH REPORT [**2547-6-4**]
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system
demonstrated
two-vessel disease. The LMCA had no angiographically apparent
disease.
The LAd had a proximal 95% stenosis. The LCx had a 99% hazy
stenosis
just prior to the second obtuse marginal branch. The RCA had
mild
disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and left-sided
filling
pressures, with an RVEDP of 22 mm Hg and a PCWP of 25 mm Hg.
There was
mild pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with a PASP of 41
mm Hg.
The cardiac index was high at 8.9 L/min/m2.
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid LCx with a 2.5 x 18mm
Promus
drug eluting stent which was postdilated to 3.0mm. Final
angiography
revealed no residual stenosis, no dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.
(see PTCA
comments for details)
4. Successful POBA of the jailed OM with a 1.5mm Apex Flex
balloon.
5. Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LAD with a 2.5 x
15mm
Promus drug eluting stent which was postdilated to 3.0 mm. Final

angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no dissection, and
TIMI 3
flow. (see PTCA comments for details)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated right- and left-sided filling pressures.
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid LCx.
4. Successful POBA of the jailed OM.
5. Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LAD.

ECHO - TTE [**2547-6-5**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
57 year old woman with HLD and family history of CAD transferred
to [**Hospital1 4**] for cardiac catheterization.  She was shocked x3 by EMS
for reported torsades.
.
# Coronary Artery Disease: Patient is status post cardiac
catheterization on [**2547-6-4**] with two stents placed to proximal
LAD and mid LCx.  She is status post cardiac arrest, shocked
three times by EMS, likely ischemic in etiology.  She received
integrillin and discharged on aspirin 325 mg PO daily, plavix
150 mg PO daily x 2 weeks and 75 mg PO daily thereafter,
simvastatin 40 mg PO QHS, and Toprol XL 50 mg PO QD.  The plavix
dose was increased for the first two weeks given her
thrombocytosis in house.  Pharmacy called and stated
atorvastatin was not covered by pt's insurance, and so she was
D/C'ed on simvastatin.  An echo prior to discharge showed normal
global left ventricular systolic function with an EF of >55%.
Patient was discharged with follow up to see cardiology at
[**Location (un) 516**] to be arranged by PCP.
.
# Rhythm: Currently, patient is in sinus. Per report she had
event of torsades, status post shock by EMS in the field.  Event
was thought to be ischemic in nature.  Patient's electrolytes
and tele were closely monitored.  No further intervention was
done, and patient was started on metoprolol.
.
# Respiratory distress: Intubated at OSH for airway protection.
Successfully extubated at [**Hospital1 4**] without any compications.
.
# GERD: Switched PPI to H2 blocker.
.
# Smoking cessation: Discussed with patient importance of
smoking cessation and risk of MI with continued tobacco use.
Patient aware, will follow up with PCP regarding this.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary:
ST elevation Myocardial Infarction


Discharge Condition:
A&OX3
Self ambulatory


Discharge Instructions:
You were transferred to [**Hospital1 4**] because you had a heart attack and
cardiac arrest.  Your cardiac arrest was because of your heart
attack.  At [**Hospital1 4**] you underwent cardiac catheterization and had
two stents placed to two coronary arteries.  We started you on
several new medications.  We have started you on aspirin and
plavix.

IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU TAKE ASPIRIN AND PLAVIX DAILY.  Do
not skip these medications.  They are blood thinners and will
prevent clot formation in your stents.

IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU STOP SMOKING.  Cigarettes can
accelerate atherosclerosis and increases your risk of a heart
attack.  You should talk to your doctor about quitting smoking.

We have made the following changes to your medications:
1. Start Plavix.  You should take plavix every day.  DO NOT MISS
THIS [**Hospital1 1893**].  You should take this [**Hospital1 **] for at least 1
year.  Your cardiologist will tell you how long to take this
for.  For the next two weeks only through [**2547-6-21**], take two
plavix at once. This will be a total of 150 mg once a day.
Then, after two weeks beginning on [**2547-6-21**], take only one pill a
day.  This will be 75 mg daily.
2. Start Aspirin.  You should take aspirin every day.  DO NOT
MISS [**First Name (Titles) 461**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1893**].
3. Start Metoprolol.
4. Switched Simvastatin to Lipitor.
5. Switched Omeprazole to Ranitidine.
6. Start Fluticasone/Salmeterol inhaler

Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with:
1. PCP: [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1894**] on Thursday, [**2547-6-8**] at 11:00 am.  His
telephone number is [**0-0-**].
He will schedule an appointment for you to see Cardiology at
[**Location (un) 1895**] cardiology.
