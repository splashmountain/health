Chief Complaint:  Dyspnea
   HPI:
   This is an 85 year old male with history of diastolic heart failure,
   copmlete heart block (now s/p PPM [**6-3**]) ESRD on HDHD, h/o MRSA
   bacteremia and thrombocytopenia, likely secondary to drug reaction
   (PPI?) who presents from [**Hospital 11**] rehab with dyspnea.  Patient reports
   SOB x 1 day.  He denies any chest pain, palpitations, N/V, abdominal
   pain, diarrhea, fevers, chills or recent cough.  Patient states he was
   walking with PT/OT and became SOB and dizzy.  Per ED report patient
   felt better after HD yesterday, but continued with SOB today along with
   AMS.  ABG done at [**Hospital 11**] Rehab which showed increased CO2 and decreased
   PaO2 from baseline so he was transferred to [**Hospital1 52**] for further care.
   In the ED:  Temp 97,  HR 71,  BP 122/53,  RR 15  88% on RA 99% on NRB
   and then on CPAP.  CXR done which showed worsening bilateral pleural
   effusions.  He was given CTX 1gm x 1, Levaquin 500mg IV x 1, Vanco 1gm
   IV x 1 and was transferred to MICU.
   On arrival, patient stated he was feeling well.  +mild SOB.  CPAP was
   removed and patient was with 98% O2 saturation on 2LNC. ABG:  7.21 //
   77 // 149 // 32
   Patient was transferred to the Medical Floor on [**3410-8-17**].  A
   thoracentesis was performed yesterday on the right lung with removal of
   1.5 Liters of serous fluid.  Patient states his symptoms did not
   improve.   CXR done after tap which showed improvement in right pleural
   effusion.  Patient reportedly had O2 desaturation at hemodialysis
   yesterday.  He was on 3L NC overnight with O2 sat of 100%.  He was
   found to be somnolent this morning with pursed lip breathing. ABG done
   which showed 7.27 // 70 // 89.  He was transferred to MICU for concern
   of hypercapnia with somnolence.
   On arrival to MICU, patient was AAOx3.  He answered all questions on
   exam and fell asleep immediately after exam.  He reports +SOB which has
   not improved since admission.  He denies CP, palpitations, N/V, fevers,
   chills or diarrhea.  He does report +non-productive cough which has
   been ongoing for a few months.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 85 year old male with history of diastolic heart failure,
   copmlete heart block (now s/p PPM [**6-3**]) ESRD on HDHD, h/o MRSA
   bacteremia and thrombocytopenia thought [**1-27**] PPI who is transferred to
   MICU for hypercapnia and somnolence.
   #.   Hypercapnia:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 4603**] has had evidence of hypercapnia for 2
   months.  This is likely from a combination of bilateral pleural
   effusions along with intrathoracic hernia.  Sleep apnea also a
   possibility as his hypercapnia seems to be worse in the morning.
   Dyspnea likely [**1-27**] pleural effusions.
   - repeat CXR to eval for reacculmulation of right effusion
   - f/u repeat ABG
   - O2 sat > 92%
   - cont HD for removal of excess fluid
   #. End Stage Renal Disease:  Patient on MWF HD treatments
   - cont MWF treatment
   #. C Diff colitis: Patient with (+) C diff tox x 3 during admission in
   [**Month (only) 567**].  On Vanco at [**Hospital 11**] rehab until [**3410-8-20**].
   - cont Vanco 250mg PO QID
   #. Diastolic heart failure: Last ECHO [**3410-7-13**] with EF >55% and mild
   mitral regurgitation
   - HD as above
   #. Atrial Fibrillation: Patient is currently V-paced
   - cont outpatient amiodarone
   - no anticoagulation given recent GI bleed
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Thought to be [**1-27**] to drug reaction one month ago
   (PPI), currently at 61, down from 113 at last admisstion. ?MDS
   - consider outpatient Heme/Onc consult
