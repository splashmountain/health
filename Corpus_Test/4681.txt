Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1487**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH, STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
84 y/o M with a history of diet-controlled diabetes,
hypertension presented to [**Hospital **] hospital from PCP's office
earlier today with cough productive of yellow sputum, sinus
congestion, chest pain with coughing, and shortness of breath
for the last several days, no fever.  PCP subsequently sent
patient to the Emergency room on 2L O2.  Patient's initial
vitals on arrival to ED were HR 102 BP 116/81 RR 20 92% 2L.  CXR
done showed "diffuse asymmetric interstitial and alveolar
process, worse on the right," pulmonary edema vs. pneumonia.
Initial ECG showed NSR, LVH, TWI/STD in Leads V4-V6, Q wave III.
 He received 40 mg IV Lasix.  He then desated to 80% when on the
commode and was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. ECG
showed [**Street Address(2) 1745**] elevation in V3, 1 mm V2, Trop I 10.  He was
given another 40 mg IV Lasix, started on a heparin gtt, given
aspirin 325, plavix 300, and taken urgently to the cath lab.
Prior to cath, he was started on a dopamine gtt after SBPs were
in the 40s, after recieving multiple doses of propofol/fentanyl
during intubation.
.
Cath showed 90% distal left main disease, 80% mid-LAD, 80% D2,
80% Circumflex, totally occluded distal RCA.  Right heart cath
was performed (on dopamine and with IABP placed), showing CO
6.38, CI 3.4, SVR 709, PCWP 18, PAP 39/20 (25).  Patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] via [**Location (un) 7532**] for evaluation for urgent
CABG.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], he had been weaned off dopamine gtt.
Initial vitals were HR 69 BP 94/52 RR 24 RR 100% on CMV 500 100%
14 5.  IABP was in place.
.
Remainder of review of systems unobtainable as patient intubated
and sedated.

CARDIAC CATH:
90% distal left main disease, 80% mid-LAD, 80% D2, 80%
Circumflex, totally occluded distal RCA.  Right heart cath was
performed showing CO 6.38, CI 3.4, SVR 709, PCWP 18, PAP 39/20
(25)

Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 25 - 30 %) with preserved basal segments but
hypokinetic mid segments and akinesis of the apex.
There is moderate global RV hypokinesis.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. There is an IABP 3 cm distal to the left subclavian
artery.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The jet is central and
reflects poor co-aptation of the leaflet tips which is worsened
by provocation with Trendelenburg position.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB:
The patient is AV-Paced on no inotropes.
LV systolic fxn is improved to an EF of 35 - 40%.
There is a partial mitral ring prosthesis with no leak, no MR
and a residual mean gradient of 4 mmHg.
AI remains trace - 1+.
IABP in good position. Aorta intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
CAD/Cardiogenic Shock: Cath showing severe 3-vessel disease
amenable to CABG.  Echo [**2-19**]  showing hypokinesis distal
anterior/septal segments and the apex (mid-LAD distribution).
LVEF = 40%.  As he was having ongoing ECG changes, he was
started on an integrillin gtt.  He was diuresed due to pulmonary
edema on CXR and high wedge on PA catheter tracings.  Patient
was plavix loaded at OSH; Plavix was held prior to CABG.
Patient remained on IABP on 1:1, as urine output decreased when
pump was weaned.  He was weaned of a dopamine drip, started on a
beta blocker.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline Cr .9.  Likely
secondary to renal hypoperfusion from cardiogenic
shock/hypotension.  Cr 1.6 on arrival, trended down to 1.3 prior
to CABG.

Taken urgently for surgery on [**2-22**]. Transferred to the CVICU in
stable condition. IABP removed on POD #1. PICC placed for access
and removed before discharge. Went into A Fib on [**2-23**] also and
was started on amiodarone. Remained in ICU for BP and
respiratory mgmt. Extubated on POD #2. Amiodarone stopped per
cardiology due to conversion pauses and managed with beta
blockade.Evaluated for aspiration risk. Chest tubes and pacing
wires removed per protocol. Coumadin started for A Fib.
Transferred to the floor on POD #5 to begin increasing his
activity level. He was gently diuresed toward his perop weight.
Continued to make good progress and was cleared for discharge to
Hellenic Rehab in [**Location (un) 2584**]. Target INR 2.0-2.5 for A Fib.
