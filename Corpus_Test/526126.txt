Chief Complaint: Hypotension
   HPI:
   79M with h/o CHF/valvular disease; admitted with hypotension and
   hypoxemia consistent with fluid overload
   24 Hour Events:
   Seen by cardiology yesterday who agreed with weaning of inotropes/dopa
   and diuresis with lasix gtt.  Overnight, his MAP decreased to 50's and
   lasix gtt was decreased with improvement in his BP.  His Cvo2 2as >
   70%.
   Otherwise, no significant change in his clinical status; he diuresed
   500cc overnight.  A TTE was obtained and revealed worsening EF with
   inferior/inferolateral segment worsened hypokinesis.

   Imaging: CXR: Suggestion of RLL/RML infiltrate and gross volume
   overload.
   Assessment and Plan
   79M admitted with hypotension and hypoxemia, thought due to cardiogenic
   shock in setting of volume overload.  However, CXR today more
   concerning for both overload and PNA.  Also, his exam suggests
   bronchospasm with wheeze.
   1.       Respiratory Failure:  COPD, also concern for PNA and volume
   overload
   -          Add steroids for bronchospam
   -          Increase nebulizers to q4h and prn
   -          Antibiotics noted below
   -          Might require NIPPV if retaining
   2.       Hypotension:  Unclear etiology, component of cardiogenic and
   possible septic shock.
   -          will continue dobutamine and dopamine
   -          Discuss with cardiology the significance of the TTE results
   - ? ischemic event several weeks ago, or is this sepis induced.
   3.       ID:  Cultures negative.  CXR suggest an infiltrate.  UA+,
   await urine culture
   -          vancomycin and zosyn; also will cover with levofloxacin for
   GN and atypical coverage.
   -          Await cultures
   4.       Renal:  Cr 2.1 from 2.5 with diuresis, suggestive of
   cardiogenic component.
   5.       Heme:  HCT 28 today
 anemia of chronic disease.
   Therapeutically anticoagulted for history of PE/DVT.
   -          hold coumadin for INR 3.5
   -          No acute bleed so no indication for reverasal
