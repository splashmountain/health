Chief Complaint:  Unresponsive, GI bleed
   HPI:
   88 y/o F with PMHx of CAD, DM, Atrial Fib, Alzheimers, CVA in [**5-7**] on
   coumadin who was found unresponsive and bradycardic at [**Hospital1 23**] this
   morning.  She received atropine and had an LMA placed by EMS, BP 80/40
   while en route to [**Hospital 2384**] hospital.  At [**Hospital1 2384**], she was found to
   have blood around her mouth, BRBPR, hct of 27, creatinine 3.2 & INR of
   10.5. Dopamine was started and she received 2 units of FFP.  She
   underwent proper ETT intubation and initial ABG 7.3/38/200/19 before
   family requested transfer to [**Hospital1 5**] ED.
   .
   In the ED, initial vs were: T 93 P 65 BP 122/72 R 14 O2 sat 100%.  Vent
   AC Fi02 100% Vt 400, Peep 5, RR 16. Pt has a left femoral line placed
   and had left EJ and PICC line in place from [**Hospital1 23**].  Pt received
   another 2units of FFP at [**Hospital1 **] and repeat hct was 20. She received
   Vanc/levo/flagyl for possible aspiration and dopamine was weaned prior
   to transfer.
   .
   Pt was intubated and sedated on arrival to ICU.  After she was settled,
   sBPs dropped from 87 to 70s, pt was given 2L NS IVF and started on
   Dopamine.

   Imaging: [**2757-6-3**] Colonoscopy revealed: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid
   colon
   Polyp in the proximal ascending colon
   .
   [**2757-5-30**] EGD revealed: There was a gastrostomy tube entry site in the
   body of the stomach. The base of the site was flushed and seen clearly.
   There were no ulcers or erosions present. The tip of the tube was
   located in the distal duodenum/proximal jejunum.
   Retained fluids in stomach There was bilious fluid in the duodenum and
   no evidence of bleeding. Otherwise normal EGD to proximal jejunum
   .
   CT head [**2757-7-31**]: No fracture, hemorrhage, edema. Atrophy, small vessel
   ischemic change. Right frontal previous hypodensity more hypodense and
   better demarcated since [**2757-4-29**] suggesting encephalomalacia in a site
   of prior infarction.
   .
   CT c-spine [**2757-7-31**]: No change from three months ago. No fracture. Severe
   degenerative change.Given canal narrowing if there is concern for cord
   injury, MRI is more sensitive.
   CXR [**2757-7-31**]: prelim- ETT tube approx 2 cm above carina and right sided
   pleural effusion tracks up lateral chest wall, cardiomegaly, hazy
   opacity in right hila?
   .
   Microbiology: Urine/blood pending
   ECG: .
   EKG: NSR with hr in 60s with IVCD, TWI in II, III and AVF, isolated ST
   elevation in v3, all essentially unchanged from prior tracings
   Assessment and Plan
   88 y/o F with PMHx of CAD, DM, Atrial Fib, Alzheimers, CVA in [**5-7**] on
   coumadin who was found unresponsive and bradycardic, INR of 10 and
   active upper/lower GI bleeds who was transferred from [**Hospital 2384**]
   hospital intubated and on pressors.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt s/p CVA found down bradycardic and
   hypotensive.  Unclear if underlying event was hypotension vs aspiration
   of bloody gastric materials as bloody/brown secretions coming from
   mouth and some frank blood being suctionned from ETT. Another
   possibility is pulm hemorrhage.  Of note, pt was recently admitted with
   Aspiration PNA treated with Ertapenem.
   - check INR and tranfuse FFP aggressively
   - recheck CXR now
   - empiric Vanc/Zosyn for hosp organisms Asp PNA
   - place a-line to follow ABG, likely wean FiO2
   - continue to meet with family q24 re goals of care
   - plan for bronch and adjustment of ETT placement
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt is hypovolemic likely due to GI bleed although also
   possible additional component of sepsis given possible aspiration
   event.   Elevated lactate at 3 on ABG and bloody secretions from mouth
   and ETT.
   - bolus NS IVF for MAP>65
   - transfuse 2u prbcs now
   - trend hct q6hrs
   - monitor UOP, goal >30cc/hr
   - trend lactate with resuscitation
   .
   # GI bleed/elevated INR: Pt with known diverticulosis and internal
   hemorrhoids who presented after being found down with blood around her
   mouth, INR of 10 and BRBPR now s/p 4units FFP with ongoing hypotension.
   Baseline hct around 30 and hct currently at 20.  Pt is getting 2units
   prbcs now and GI planning EGD in pm
   - tranfuse 2units now for goal hct >25
   - bolus IVF
   - correct INR with FFP, Vit K 10mg now
   - f/u GI recs likely EGD today
   - maintain CVL, PIV and PICC
   - maintain active type and cross for 4units
   - t/b general surgery re upper GI bleed
   .
   # CAD/Elevated Troponin: EKGs appear at baseline, troponin leak likely
   due to strain in setting hypotension, bradycardia and GI bleed.
   - continue cycling CE
   - holding ASA & Coumadin due to GI bleed
   - monitor EKG daily
   - holding BB & Statin due to GI bleed
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Pt with baseline creatinine in the 1.2-1.5
   range, currently 2.6 with BUN>100.  Pt is hypovolemic due to GI bleed
   but may also have a component of sepsis given possible aspiration.  Pt
   with anasarca of unclear etiology, may be due to low albumin but with
   check UA for proteinuria
   - continue to bolus IVF
   - monitor UOP, foley in place
   - check UA, prot/creatinine
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   # Elevated Anion Gap: Likely due to acute renal failure and lactic
   acidosis.
   - place a-line, trend ABGs
   - empiric antiobiotics, trend lactate and bolus IVF
   - resume sodium bicarb [**Hospital1 **] (home regimen) if acidosis does not respond
   to resuscitation
   .
   # Afib s/p CVA: Pt with active GI bleed complicated by elevated INR
   - holding coumadin and reversing INR with FFP/Vitamin K
   - hold aspirin
   - hold BB, currently bradycardic/hypotensive
   .
   # CT C-spine: question of soft tissue swelling per radiology, clear
   asymmetry and possible neck hematoma.  Airway protected by ETT and will
   continue to monitor for now
   - reverse INR
   - re-image neck with contrast when creatinine down
   .
   # Edema: Anasarca of likely due to poor nutrition status but also +2
   protein in prior UA.
   - check Albumin and UA with prot/creat ratio
   .
   # FEN: NPO with bolus IVF prn
   - replete electrolytes aggressively
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   .
   # Access: Left Femoral Line, left EJ and PICC
   - will need a-line and possible exchange for RIJ CVL ([**Month (only) 438**] risk
   infection)
   .
   # Code: Confirmed FULL with family, plan to reassess daily based on
   clinical progress
   .
   # Communication: Family, daughter/son
   .
   # Disposition: ICU for now.

   ------ Protected Section ------
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   resident for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with
   the note above, including the assessment and plan.  To that I would add
   the following:  this is an 88 yo woman who is in the MICU with a GI
   bleed in the setting of a INR of 10.  Has central access in place
   will keep groin line due to question of neck hematoma.  Giving FFP,
   pRBCs.  GI planning to do EGD today.  Will also plan on bronchoscopy
   given blood from ETT.  Currently able to be weaned off pressors.
