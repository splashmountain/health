Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**3384-10-5**] LV Apico-Aortic Valved Conduit via Left
Thoracotomy(16mm LV Apical Connector with a 18mm Porcine Valved
Conduit)


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 14811**] is an 81 year-old gentleman with an extensive history
of coronary artery disease, s/p AMI at age 37, CABG in [**3366**]
(LIMA-LAD, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM1) with redo in [**3372**] (occuded LIMA-LAD
and SVG-PDA, RIMA-LAD,SVG-PDA, SVG-OM2). He had a [**3380**]
catheterization for NSTEMI and underwent PCI of 90% lesion in
the OM1 with a 3 x 8 mm Cypher DES. His RIMA-LAD, SVG-PDA and
SVG-OM2 were all patent. History also significant for CHF with
an an EF of 25% s/p cardiac resynchronization and biventricular
pacemaker placement, hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

At his baseline (a few months back), the patient was able to
work in the yard for 10 minutes+ after which time he would
become SOB. After resting for 10-15 minutes he would again be
okay to work. Over the last few weeks, he has noticed SOB at
rest. Some of these episodes are associated with "chest
tightness". The tightness was across his chest with no
radiation. He would occasionally have nausea with it but no
diapheresis. Usually lasted a few minutes and would be relieved,
at times, with burping or walking. He did not note any of the
tightness with exertion. He notes that the pain is not like that
of his MI, which was back pain and much more severe. Over the
last week he has noticed that the symptoms are increasing in
frequency (now occuring daily). On the day of admission, he
awoke at 6am and felt SOB. This did not abate and given the
duration of symptoms, he went to his PCP who then referred him
to an OSH. His symptoms improved with intravenous Lasix and he
was eventually transferred to the [**Hospital1 68**] for cardiac surgical
evaluation.

[**3384-9-24**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferolateral, lateral,
anteroseptal and apical segments. There is hypokinesis of the
remaining segments, with relative preservation of only the basal
and mid-inferior segments and basal anterior segment (LVEF =
25%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. There are three severely thickened aortic valve
leaflets. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
[**3384-9-27**] Cardiac Catheterization:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

demonstrates severe native vessel disease.  The LMCA has a
patent stent
into the ramus.   The pLAD is 100 occluded.  The AV groove LCx
is a
small vessel- OM1 is 90% occluded and beyond OM1 there is a
subtotal
occlusion.  OM2 fills via the patent SVG graft.  The RCA is
known
occluded and is not engaged.
2.  Arterial conduit angiography of the RIMA to LAD showed the
graft to
be widely patent.  Of note, the rigth subclavian artery
originates
distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery.  The RIMA
graft
travels in front of the heart, directly behind the sternum to
anastomose
with the LAD.
3.  Bypass graft angiography shows that the SVG to PDA that was
patent
in [**3380**] is now proximally occluded.  The SVG to OM2 remains
patent and
fills the OM2 distally.
[**3384-9-28**] Chest CT Scan:
1. Widespread ground-glass opacities with upper lung
distribution. Radiological pattern is consistent with
respiratory bronchiolitis (in a smoker), hypersensitivity
pneumonitis, or acute viral infection such as viral, less likely
pulmonary hemorrhage.
2. Extensive atherosclerotic coronary and aortic calcifications.
3. Severe aortic valve calcifications consistent with known
aortic stenosis.
4. Hypodense liver lesions, some of them too small to be
precisely characterized. Evaluation with ultrasound is
recommended . Status post cholecystectomy.
5. Bilateral left more than right pleural effusions.
6. Cardiomegaly. Possible left ventricular aneurysm
[**3384-9-28**] Carotid Ultrasound:
Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 14811**] was admitted to cardiology service. He was noted to be
in atrial fibrillation and started on intravenous Heparin.
Cardiac surgery was consulted and extensive preoperative
evaluation was performed. An echocardiogram revealed substantial
increase in aortic stenosis and pulmonary pressures, while left
ventricular function and the severity of mitral regurgitation
appeared similar in comparison to [**3380**] - see result section for
additional details. Cardiac catheterization was performed which
showed patent RIMA to LAD and patent vein graft to obtuse
marginal. The vein graft to the PDA was occluded. (See result
section for additional cath results.) Additional preoperative
workup included chest CT scan and carotid non invasive studies -
see result section. He was also cleared by the dental service
after clinical and radiographic examinations showed no obvious
infection. Given the location of the RIMA and extensive aortic
calcifications, it was decided to proceed with LV apico-aortic
valved conduit approach via thoracotmy rather than median
sternotomy. His preoperative course was otherwise uneventful and
he remained pain free on medical therapy. On [**10-5**], Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] performed an LV Apico-Aortic Valved Conduit operation
via left thoractomy. Please see seperate dictated operative note
for details. Following the operation, he was brought to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. He was initially
maintained on Amiodarone for ventricular ectopy while Warfarin
anticoagulation was initiated for atrial fibrillation. Due to
persistent postop hypotension, it took several days to wean from
inotropic support. Once his hemodynamics stablized, he
eventually transferred to the SDU for further care and recovery.
He remained in atrial fibrillation with improvement in
ventricular ectopy. Amiodarone was eventually discontinued while
beta blockade was advanced as tolerated. Warfarin was dosed for
a goal INR between 2.0 - 2.5. Over several days, he continued to
make clinical improvements with diuresis and made steady
progress with physical therapy. By postperative day seven, he
was medically cleared for discharge to rehab. At discharge, his
BP was 96/50 with a HR of 71. His oxygen saturations were 95% on
room air and the discharge chest x-ray showing a slight element
of fluid overload. At discharge, he will continue to require
diuresis. If there is improvement in blood pressure, an ACE
inhibitor should be resumed given his congestive heart failure.
