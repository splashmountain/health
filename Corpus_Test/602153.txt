   Assessment and Plan
   Problems:
   1. [**Name2 (NI) 5389**] VAP
   2. ARDS
   3. [**Last Name (un) **]
   4. Coagulopathy
   5. Cirrhosis
   She has continued to improve over the past couple of days with dialysis
   and volume removal.  Her mental status is better than it was last
   week.  She is now tolerating tube feeds, and we are now able to give
   her lactulose so our hope is that this will also improve her mental
   status.  Will continue the meropenem for a 15 day course, and po vanco
   for C.diff.  Will change her ventilator to PSV today and see if she can
   tolerate it; may need increased peep given abdominal distention.
   Coagulopathy likely due to low-grade DIC, and is stable.
