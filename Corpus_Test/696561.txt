   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colonic adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures and deteriorating mental status, aspiration
   pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and failure resulting in
   intubation ([**3-23**]), ARF, hypotension requiring phenylephrine. Being
   transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting cardiologist.
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis: Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty in [**12-18**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in
   her hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her
   lasix were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU and appears very
   fluid overloaded on physical exam. Pt has not responded to IV lasix.
   - holding on further diuresis
   - continue to closely monitor volume status
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt has good control of HR on beta blockade and
   digoxin.
   - continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID
   - continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily
   - coumadin was being held for ?supratherapeutic INR; INR subtherapeutic
   this AM; restart heparin gtt and coumadin
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p CABG [**75**]/[**3066**].
   - continue metoprolol as above
   - continue aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Per prior notes, pt has had seizures, loaded
   with dilantin and ativan PRN prior to admission with poor mental
   status. Despite loading dose continued to have sub clinical seziures on
   EEG. Medication regimen changed, currently on phenytoin and
   phenobarbitol.
   - continue phenytoin and Phenobarbital, adjusting per neuro recs
   - appreciate neuro recs
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Now, s/p trach.
   - trach in place
   - continue albuterol/atrovent PRN
   .
   # Pressor Requirement: Able to wean down this morning.
   - will lower MAP goal to try to keep pt off of pressors
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Still worsening. Per previous notes, renal
   believes that this is ATN. Recommend to not diurese or give IVF's.
   - holding on further diuresis, as above
   - continue to monitor fluid status otherwise
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue synthroid 75 mcg daily
   .
   # Fevers: Per notes, pt completed vanc/cefepime 7 day course for
   pneumonia as well as 3 days course of abx for positive UA. Afebrile
   overnight.
   - f/u cx data
   - follow fever curve
   - stool for c.diff
