Chief Complaint: This is a 67 year-old female with ESRD s/p failed
   cadaveric renal tx on HD, recent admission for line sepsis, CAD, dCHF,
   hx PE, who presented to the ED with fevers and rigors and is
   transferred to the MICU for hypotension/concern for sepsis in the
   setting of HD.

   High residuals on tube feeds, increasing the suspicion of abdominal
   pathology. Abdominal CT was performed, revealing abcesses in liver,
   kidney and spleen. She was empirically started on micafungin, mycolytic
   cultures, CMV antigen was sent out.
   She also developed a transaminitis to high 1000's
   In afternoon, febrile to 102.8, hypotensive with increasing lactate =
   pancultured, got fluid ressucitation, started on neo. Almost
   immediately rebounded, became hypertensive to 180s, bp's remained
   labile for rest of afternoon, eventually weaned off neo. Last night bps
   tanked again, now on stress dose steroids, and has required neo and
   levo to maintain maps in the high 50s.
   Given fevers HD line removed, tip cultured. Hemodialysis tunnel line
   placement deferred as she became hemodynamically unstable with plan for
   temporary line placement today.
   HD tunnel deferred in setting of hemodynamic instability and temp, with
   plan for temporary line placement today and CVVH rather than HD if
   continues to require pressor support.
    Arterial line flattened, initially attempted rewiring, but clotted, so
   removed.
   Echo showed improvement of Left systolic function,also continues to
   have 2+ aortic [**Last Name (LF) 9845**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] explain why lower pressures, but this has
   been stable.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 DIARRHEA
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 DYSPNEA (SHORTNESS OF BREATH)
   Abdominal abcesses vs infarction:  Potentially disseminated
   candidiasis. Possible sources include urinary tract, possible
   embolization from AS valve.
   Micafungin started,mycolitic cultures sent,
   -Consider TEE to visualize valve.
   Sepsis: Hypotension, fevers, rising white count. Infectious vs non
   infectious. Treating with vanc/cefepime/ micafungin until cultures come
   back neg.
   Day   Vancomycin
   Day  Cefepime
   Day 1 micafungin
   -f/u urine, bacterial/mycolytic, CMV, sputum Cx.
   Transaminitis: AST/ALT jumped from 99/42 to 7697/[**3402**] in 24 hours.
   Possibly due to abcess/infection, more likely ischemic, vs thrombotic,
   less likely drug.
   Consider RUQ US.
   Hold tylenol.
   Continue to trend LFTs.
   ESRD: K+ rising 5+ today, azotemia, + fluid balance. HD cath pulled
   y/d, given hemodynamic instability/ febrile, tunneled line deferred,
   consider temporary line placement by IR with plan for CVVH, diurese to
   net negative.
   &#9658; RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]): No changes to vent
   support. Given pressor requirement, fevers, defer wean for now.
   Continue sedation with versed, fentanyl.
   Lactate 4 currently, continue Q6 VBG/lactate.
   -Initially planned neuromuscular consult, nixed
   &#9658; BACTEREMIA MSSA: Abx d/c'd yesterday, and nafcillin started
   back yesterday.
   - Nafcillin - on day 11 of antibiotics (vanc or naf), plan for 21 day
   course per ID
   - f/u cultures
   &#9658; ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM): possibly [**2-25**] sepsis vs
   ICP vs agitation.  LP performed. Currently sedated. Brain imaging not
   revealing. Sedated.
   - f/u LP results
   - lighten sedation as possible with anxiolytics
   - EEG
   &#9658; RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC
   KIDNEY DISEASE): ESRD s/p failed renal txp, on dialysis.
   - CVVH last night, 1.6L off
   - f/u renal recs
   - Renal may need to replace line, consider line holiday, then line
   placed by IR
   Hyperglycemia: uncontrolled last few days. Added NPH to PM dose,
   monitor today. Consider altering sliding scale for better control.
   - Evaluate insulin sliding scale
   - Increased AM NPH to 7, PM to 5, evaluate today
   - q6h blood sugars
   Talk with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2700**] and update PCP.
   &#9658; CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS.  Perc drained by surgery.  Surgery
   ready to sign off.
   - continue to monitor output.
   &#9658; ALTERATION IN NUTRITION
   - tube feeds as tolerated, titrate to goal
   &#9658; ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (ACS, UNSTABLE ANGINA, CORONARY
   ISCHEMIA).  earlier in admission had ventricular arrhythmias on
   pressors, now resolved after 1d heparin drip and lidocaine drip.
   - Cont. to monitor for dysrrhythmias
   SVC syndrome - Not on systemic anticoagulation due to blood from
   gallbladder perc drain.
