   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   82 year old male with a history of CAD (S/P CABG), ESRD on HD, AAA s/p
   repair, who was transferred from OSH with lower GI bleed.
   GI Bleed
   Hemodynamically stable. HCT relatively stable sp 7 Units PRBCs.
   - GI to repeat EGD today.
   - Q8H hematocrits
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Definitive management depends on endoscope.
   Leukocytosis
   White count trending down. No clear source of infection. Abd CT without
   intra abdominal process. Afebrile. C. Diff Negative. Cipro/Flagyl
   stopped yesterday.
   - Culture if spikes
   - FU blood cultures
   ESRD on HD
   Renal planning for HD today.
   - Will discuss with Renal possibility of HD today to take off some
   volume prior to extubation.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins.
   Ventilation
   Failed SBTs x 2 yesterday. Likely [**1-24**] fluid overload in context of
   transfusions.
   - D/w Renal for aggressive goal for fluid off.
   - Attempt SBT again after dialysis
   - Extubate if passed SBT
   CAD
   Stable
   - Hold ASA, BB in the setting of GI bleed
   - Continue statin
   Back and hip pain
   - Continue tramadol, oxazepam as BP tolerates.
   Bullous pemphigoid
   Stable. Patient on prednisone taper. Will continue taper after acute
   episode resolves. Continuing stress dose steroids yesterday. Follow up
   with Dermatology at discharge.
   - Resume taper
