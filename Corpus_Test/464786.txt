   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted to CCU after failure
   to extubate s/p elective AICD placement and right heart catheterization
   c/b atelectasis and pulmonary infection.
   .
   # Fever and leukocytosis: Patient afebrile since noon on [**1-3**] with
   change in antibiotic regimen from Levofloxacin (day 10), Cefepime (day
   4), Vancomycin (day 11), and Flagyl (d/c'd on day 2). WBC today 14.5.
   Repeated sputum cultures, most recently from [**1-2**], demonstrate
   pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens, but did not respond well to
   Levofloxacin. CT scan from [**1-4**] pending, but preliminary read
   demonstrates LL lobe collapse and partial RLL collapse. Blood cx from
   [**12-29**] grew CoNS in
 bottles, likely contamination.  Swan catheter was
   removed on [**1-1**] after PICC placed, but swan tip culture negative.
   Flagyl d/c'd on [**1-3**]. Other major possibilities for source of fever is
   atelectasis and drug reaction
   - F/U final CT chest/abdomen/pelvis read
   - F/U outstanding blood cultures/final sputum cultures/c .diff
   - Cefepime, day 4
   - Vancomycin, day 10
   - Tylenol prn: fever (< 2 grams daily)
   - Continue to monitor for progression in suspected drug rash
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient was stable on PS [**9-13**] x several days,
   but on [**1-3**] was switched back to AC with increasing PEEP requirement
   for worsening respiratory status.  Preliminary CT chest from [**3422-1-4**]
   demonstrated complete LLL collapse and partial RLL collapse. Sputum
   cultures from [**1-2**] continue to grow Serratia. Extubated on Day 10 of
   intubation. LOS fluid balance is negative at least 7.8L. Pulmonary
   following, recommended changes to antibiotics regimen. Currently
   Saturates 90% on Room air
   - speech and swallow
   - cool mist face tent
   - Antibiotics as above.
   - F/u pulmonary recs
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved. Creatinine bumped from 1.3 to 2.3 on
   [**1-1**] in the setting of hypotension, patient was receiving lasix gtt as
   well as diamox, metolazone, and captopril.  Creatinine returned to
   baseline of 1.3 this AM. Renal following.
   - Continue to hold Lasix gtt, Diamox, Metolazone
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - F/U renal recs
   - Avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: Patient with profound
   biventricular systolic dysfunction, presumably secondary to prior heavy
   cocaine use in year prior to CHF diagnosis.  Cardiac catheterization
   performed on [**12-27**] included myocardial biopsy. TTE of [**12-26**] shows EF of
   10% that may be an overestimate. [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10328**] [**Location (un) 101**] elevated PA pressures and
   wedge pressures during catheterization. His morbid obesity and history
   of substance abuse makes cardiac transplantation candidacy questionable
   but it is likely crucial to his long term viability.  Length of CCU
   stay negative 6.5-7L.  Blood pressures difficult to control without
   compromising UOP and diuresis complicated by hyperbicarbia
   (contraction) and acute renal failure (creatinine bumped from 1.3 to
   2.3), so all antihypertensives and diuretics held on [**1-3**]. Since
   defeverescing, patient with sbp
s in the 130-140
s, ARF resolved,
   hypercarbia noticeably improved.
   - PT to evaluate
   - Continue to hold Diamox & Metolazone
   - Consider Lasix boluses PRN, titrating to maintain CCU goal of -6.5 to
   7L
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate PO to 50 mg TID
   - Digoxin 0.25mg PO daily
   - Replete K to 5
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient continues to be tachycardic, but improvement in hr
   to the 90-100
s since defeverescing. Patient is s/p AICD placement for
   primary prevention of tachyarrythmias given non-ischemic cardiomyopathy
   EF of 10% (presently). One episode of NSVT in the CCU.  Dig level 1.3
   on [**1-3**].
   - F/U Final CT chest to confirm lead placement
   - Replete K to 5, Mg > 2
   - Digoxin 0.25mg PO daily
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate PO 50mg TID
   .
   # UGIB:  Patient was noted to have a small amount of bright red blood
   in his NG tube on [**1-1**], NG lavage did not demonstrate an active bleed.
   His Hct has been stable and no further blood has been detected. GI
   aware. This was likely irritation from the NG tube
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Continue IV PPI
   - Continue TF
s if s/s failed
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Stable at 1.7, last checked on [**3422-1-3**], likely
   congestive. Given fever, he was ruled out for cholecystitis and may
   have gallbladder agenesis as it was unable to be imaged by CT or US.
   - Intermittent LFT checks
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known hx of CAD.
   - ASA 325mg daily
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg PO TID
   .
   # Anemia: Known iron deficiency anemia.  Hct stable despite small GIB
   noted on [**1-1**].
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg PO TID,  Ascorbic Acid 250mg PO TID, on bowel
   regimen
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Asthma: Albuterol 1-2 puffs q6H:PRN wheezing once extubated.
   .
   # OSA:  Nocturnal CPAP once extubated.
