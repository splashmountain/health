Allergies:
Bactrim

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2498**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on Exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right and Left Heart Catheterization
ICU Care with arterial cannulation, central venous cannulation
Mechanical Ventilation

History of Present Illness:
46F s/p autologous BMT for NHL in [**2846**] with course complicated
by radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis and chemo-induced
cardiomyopathy now on transtracheal O2 who presents with
increasing dyspnea on exertion, tachycardia, and cough. Although
OMR notes reveal prior complaints of DOE, patient reports
worsening over the past 2-3 weeks. Denies pleuritic chest pain
but does report some back pain with coughing. No exertional
chest pain (but she feels unable to exert herself enough to know
- no history of exertional CP). She was previously on 2L TTO at
rest and increased to 4L with activity. She has now increased to
3L at rest with >4L with activity (she reports she turns it up
as high as she can and is still unable to exercise - she even
gets short of breath brushing her teeth). She has previously had
volume overload but not in a long while and denies pedal edema
or orthopnea. She had pneumonia in [**4-23**] which presented with
neck stiffness and wheezing - she denies these symptoms at
present. Reports seasonal allergies without asthma. She has a
dog at home and has lived in the same place with that dog for
years. Previously worked as a field officer for NSTAR where she
may have been exposed to hazardous fumes, but since [**4-23**] she has
been on disability. Denies fevers.
She reports tachycardia seems to have started with this
worsening dyspnea as well.
Saw pulmonologist in beginning of [**Month (only) **] who felt she was
doing well. Seen by PT in early [**Month (only) **] as well - report states
that she gets out of breath with exertion on treadmill but at
that point she did not feel this was worse than previous and O2
sat actually was better than previously.
Of note patient is on hormone replacement therapy
(Premarin/Provers) since it was decided that she should not have
children post-chemo. She does not smoke. She has not had
personal or family history of blood clots.


Past Medical History:
1.  Non-hodgkin's lymphocytic lymphoma: Diagnosed in [**2844**],
treated with radiation and adriamycin, autologous bone marrow
transplantation in [**2846**], one episode of congesive heart failure
in the first one to two months after her transplantation, good
recovery after that and cancer free since then.
2.  IPF:  Developed SOB 2 years ago, likely related to full body
irradiation, found to have bilateral pulmonary fibrosis and
apical blebs.  Has been treated with prednisone and supplemental
oxygen.  PFTs from [**2862-3-22**] demonstrated no change in restrictive
pattern since [**2861-10-3**].
3.  Systolic Heart Failure:  Diagnosed in [**2860**] at same time of
IPF, likely due to Adriamycin treatment for NHL.  Echo from
[**2862-3-13**] demonstrated mild to moderate global left ventricular
hypokinesis (ejection fraction 40 percent) and moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension without R-ventricular
abnormalities.  This was no change from a [**3-22**] echo.
4.  Pulm HTN:  Echo from [**2862-3-13**] demonstrated moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension without R-ventricular abnormalities
in size, structure, and contractile function.
5.  Chronic anemia:  Thought to be related to her BMT in [**2846**].
Labs in OMR since [**4-/2859**] demonstrate Hct ranging from 28.7 to
34.3.
.
PSH:
-None but currently being evaluated for lung vs heart/lung
transplant at [**Hospital1 592**]

REPORTS AND STUDIES

[**2863-3-16**]
1. No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection. The coronary
arteries arise from the normal expected anatomical location.

2. Chronic pulmonary fibrosis as described above in
predominately subpleural location, unchanged.

ECHO [**2863-3-20**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of
the anteroseptum and inferior walls. Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with mild hypokinesis of the free wall. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve is abnormal.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased
suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2863-1-8**],
subtle left ventricular regional wall hypokinesis was present,
however, the right ventricle has increased in size with signs of
pressure volume overload. Severe estimated pulmonary systolic
hypertension is now present.

ECHO [**2863-3-31**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses is normal with wmall cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesis of the distal anterior wall and apex. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45%). The right
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free
wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2863-3-20**], the
right ventricle is larger with more prominent free wall
hypokinesis. An apical left ventricular wall motion abnormality
is now present. The severity of tricuspid regurgitation is
similar.

C CATH [**2863-3-23**]
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Hypovolemia.
3. No significant change in cardiac output with volume
challenge.
3. Significant increase in cardiac output with little change in
pulmonary artery pressures during 100% O2 (therefore, PVR
decreased).
4. Compared to baseline, significant increase in cardiac output
and
decrease in pulmonary artery pressures with nitric oxide
therapy.
5. Given low cardiac index would use caution if considering
calcium
channel blocker therapy.


Brief Hospital Course:
PULMONARY HYPERTENSION / BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA
The patient was admitted with dyspnea on exertion. She underwent
cardiac catheterization which revealed elevated pulmonary
vascular resistance that did not significantly improve after
vasodilator trial. She was trialed on sildenifil without
benefit, and this was discontinued. After catheterization, she
developed sepsis, meeting SIRS criteria with positive sputum
gram stain with gram positive cocci. That culture ultimately
grew aspergillus, discussed below.

She developed respiratory distress with while septic, and was
electively intubated without immediate complication.

Her pulmonary disease was quite severe, and she was difficult to
ventilate, requiring high pressures in a pressure control
ventilation mode.

CARDIAC ARREST / CARDIOGENIC SHOCK
Unfortunately 3-4 hours after intubation, the patient became
bradycardic and became pulseless in PEA arrest, and a code was
called. She was given CPR and epinephrine x3 and atropine. A
femoral code line was placed. She was briefly in what appeared
to be VT and was shocked x1, and regained spontaneous
circulation. She was initially hypertensive in the next few
minutes but then became quite hypotensive, requiring vasopressor
support, ultimately being maxed on 3 pressors. Over the next 72
hours, pressors were slowly weaned, with the exception of severe
hypotensive episode at 72h likely from hypoxia [**2-17**] cuff leak,
from which she recoved.

Echocardiogram showed severe pulmonary hypertension and right
heart failure.

RESPIRATORY FAILURE
The patient remained intubated, and was on pressure control
ventillation, with a PIP set initially at 45. This was attempted
to be decreased, ended at PIP of 41, but still with elevated
PEEPs.

SEPSIS
The presumption at time of first meeting SIRS criteria was that
she had pneunomia. She was treated broadly with vancomycin and
Zosyn, and caspofungin added later for aspergillus.

One week after her arrest, she again became hypotensive and
febrile, with presumption of infection. Sources included VAP,
line infection, urine, or progression of aspergillus. SHe
remained on her broad spectrum antibiotics, and her femoral line
was promptly discontinued, but the patient rapidly before she
became febrile, hypotensive requiring multiple vasopressor
support, high FiO2, sedation and paralysis again.

With her underlying severe pulmonary disease and recurrent
severe septic episode, a family meeting was held, and the family
via HCP decided to make the patient [**Name (NI) 2508**].

ASPERGILLUS INFECTION
The patient grew aspergillus from expectorated sputum prior to
intubation, and was started on caspofungin.

ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
The patient went into renal failure after her cardiac arrest,
likely ATN. She still maintained some concentrating capacity.

EXPIRATION

Within hours of the [**Name (NI) 2508**] decision, the patient died peacefully
and quietly in the presence of her friends and family.
