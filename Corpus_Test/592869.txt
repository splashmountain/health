   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O AORTIC ANEURYSM, ABDOMINAL WITHOUT RUPTURE (AAA)
 DEPRESSION
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
   42 y/o M Malignant HTN, Type A dissection s/p emergent repair in [**2856**],
   Type B dissection, Depression admitted now transfered for further
   medical management of HTN and hyperaldosteronism
   # Malignant HTN/Hyperaldosterone: Given his hx of elevated Aldosterone,
   decreased PRA, HTN in setting if hypokalemia, this is c/w primary
   hyperaldosteronism. CT abd reveals stable lipoma but no adrenal
   adenoma.  BP responded to Ativan in the setting of anxiety and
   tearfullness, but required additional dose of IV Hydral overnight for
   HTN while sleeping. Low dose klonopin seems to be doing well for
   component of anxiety.
   - appreciate endocrine recs
   - f/u repeat renin, [**Male First Name (un) **] after salt load and K repletion -- levels from
   [**4-11**]
   - serum metanephrines: normal
   - continue 50 PO BID spironolactone
   - TID lytes to monitor K
   - will adjust his BP regimen by trying to come off drips and to a
   reasonable home regimen
   - cont Klonipin for anxiety
   # Type B dissection: with dissection flap extending into the left renal
   artery, and probable areas of left renal infarct.
   - goal SBP 140-160 (he reportedly gets hypotensive sx when SBP<120's
   per surgery service)
   - per vascular, they can tolerate SBP 160's
   # Anemia: Hct 30 today
   - if large drop, will contact vascular given risk of extravasation
   # L Renal infarct: Likely in setting of dissection
   - continue to monitor renal status
   # Depression: Currently denies SI but does endorse depressed mood. Very
   tearful this morning and feeling very overwhelmed. Klonipin somewhat
   helpful.
   - cont Klonipin
   - appreciate SW consult
   - f/u with psych
   - started risperdol per psych
   # FEN:
   - regular low Na diet
   # PPX:
   - SQ heparin
   - H2 blocker
   - bowel regimen as no BM in 4 days
