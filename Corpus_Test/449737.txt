   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo F w/ CAD, ischemic [**Month/Year (2) 5254**] (EF 10%) s/p [**Hospital1 **]-V ICD, atrial
   fibrillation, CKD, with past history of DVT and PE on Coumadin who was
   recently discharged from the CCU ([**1-1**]) for CHF exacerbation c/b
   C.diff infection, admitted from OSH with septic shoulder joint (MRSA)
   and hypoxia, requiring intubation.
   # Hypotension: low BP requiring pressor support with dopamine (weaned
   off dobutamine).  Etiology likely multifactorial shock from sepsis
   (MRSA bacteremia and septic shoulder) and cardiogenic with EF of 10%.
   On RV catheterization [**1-17**]; CVL > 17 suggesting that hypovolemia is not
   playing significant role in hypotension
   - wean dopamine to maintain adequate end organ perfusion
   - cont abx coverage with vancomycin 1gm q 48hrs
   - source control with left shoulder/ hip washout/ aspiration
   - aggressive diuresis role with -1 to 2 L/day as tolerated by BP
   # Septic Joint:  Patient with +staph aureus in left shoulder.  Patient
   also had +hemarthrosis of left shoulder. Ortho performed aspiration of
   L shoulder joint [**3425-1-16**].
   - continue Vanc
   - arthoscopy of left shoulder, arthroscopy of right MCP and left hip
   planned for today
   - PO vitamin K for reversal of INR, hold heparin gtt at 2am tomorrow
   # Bacteremia: OSH blood cultures positive today for GPC in
   clusters/pairs, likely MRSA with likely source septic glenohumeral
   joint.  No evidence of endocarditis on TEE yesterday.  Other possible
   etiologies PNA (GPC in sputum), UTI, line infection.  Picc line placed
   at OSH replaced yesterday with central cordis
   - continue IV Vanc
   - cont daily surveillance cx until negative
   # CORONARIES: Patient with h/o CAD w/ right dominant system, mild
   instent re-stenois of the LAD BM stent and occluded RCA.  No evidence
   of ischemic event precipitating cardiogenic shock
   - con Simva 20mg
   - on telemetry
   - hold ASA pending surgical intervention tomorrow
   # PUMP: Patient with h/o ischemic [**Last Name (LF) 5254**], [**First Name3 (LF) 281**] 10%, s/p BiV ICD ([**Company 2322**]
   Concerto C154DWK) [**2-19**].  As above, admitted with  symptoms of
   cardiogenic shock with volume overload .  Currently autodiuresing
   - strict I/Os  with aggressive diuresis as tolerated by BP
   - daily weights
   - consider restarting Lasix if output diminishes
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient currently extubated and maintaining
   adequate saturation on RA.  Respiratory failure likely secondary to
   mucus plugging and underlying CHF. Pt has sputum Cx with GPC in pairs,
   but no evidence of PNA on CXR.
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - elective intubation for procedure tomorrow
   # RHYTHM: Patient with h/o atrial fibrillation, s/p BiV ICD ([**Company 2322**]
   Concerto C154DWK) [**2-19**], on coumadin.  Patient paced on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 167**]
   obtain ECG to compare with previous ECG. Intra-atrial thrombus on TEE,
   on heparin gtt
   - cont home Amiodarone
   - hold dig, supratherapeutic level 2.6
   - reverse INR with vitamin K pending surgical intervention tomorrow
   -hold heparin gtt at 2 am tomorrow am.
   # Acute on CRF: Patient w/ baseline Cr 1.3-1.8, 2.4 on presentation.
   Likely related to CHF. FEUrea 35%.
   - monitor Cr
   .
   # H/o DVT/PE: Patient has h/o DVT/PE currently on heparin gtt and has a
   [**Location (un) **] filter in place.  Supratherapeutic INR, now improved to
   therapeutic range of 2.8.
   - reverse INR with vitamin k x 1
   - start heparin gtt, hold tomorrow prior to OR
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue Levothyroxine.
   .
   # Allopurinol:  Patient on Allopurinol, unclear why. Right 3^rd MCP
   joint swelling may be related to gout, but shoulder tap shows
   pseudogout.
   # FEN: NPO after midnight, replete lytes PRN
   .
   # ACCESS: L subclavian triple lumen
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS: heparin gtt
   .
   # CODE: DNR/ DNI (will reverse for OR tomorrow am)
   .
   # DISPO: CCU for now
