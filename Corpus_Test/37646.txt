History of Present Illness:
75 year old gentleman with known mitral valve regurgitation and
prolpase which has been followed by echocardiogram. This was
first discovered in [**3399**] when he established primary care with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **]. He previously had not been to a physician in many
years however notes a 26 year history of being told he had a
heart murmur. His history is complicated by an episode last year
of delerium and dementia which was possibly caused by acute
alcohol toxicity and or acute renal failure. He is left with a
bilateral frontal lobe dysfunction which leave him with
cognitive and psychomotor dysfunction but his laguage function,
visuospacial and memory are intact. Given the severity of his
disease, he has been referred for surgical evaluation.

Pertinent Results:
[**3401-6-26**] ECHO
PREBYPASS
The left atrium is massive. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The left ventricle is not well seen.
Overall left ventricular systolic function however appears
normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function
is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is partial posterior mitral leaflet flail. An eccentric,
anteriorly directed jet of Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is
seen.

POSTBYPASS
The LV remains difficult to visualize. LV systolic function
appears at least mildly impaired. The ventricular septum appears
dyskinetic and the inferior wall appears hypokinetic. There is a
ring prostheis in the mitral position. The MV leaflets coapt and
no MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 26214**]. The LAA is no longer [**Last Name (Titles) 26214**]. RV
systolic function remains normal.

[**3401-6-25**] - Cardiac Catheterization
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated
single vessel disease. The LMCA in some views appeared to have a
50%
ostial lesion however with repositioning of the catheter there
was no
stenosis present and there was no catheter dampening observed.
The LAD
had 30% proximal stenosis and 50-60% mid vessel stenosis. The
LCx and
RCA had minimal disease.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mild systemic arterial
systolic
hypertension with SBP 140 mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild systemic arterial systolic hypertension.

[**3401-6-25**] - Carotid Ultrasound
Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%. Left ICA stenosis <40%.

Coumadin at hospital - received 2mg coumadin - INR 1.3 [**6-28**], 5mg
coumadin - INR 1.2 [**6-29**], coumadin 2mg - INR 1.3 [**6-30**] - coumadin
2 mg - INR 1.8 [**7-1**]


Brief Hospital Course:
Presented for cardiac catheterization and admitted post
procedure for preoperative workup.  On [**3401-6-26**] he was taken to
the operating room and underwent mitral valve repair, a MAZE
procedure and coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  Please see
operative note for further details. Postoperatively he was taken
to the intensive care unit for monitoring. He required
Epinephrine, fluids, and neosynephrine for hemodynamic
management, continued on amiodarone drip for MAZE procedure.  He
remained intubated due to hypoxia requiring increased PEEP.  On
postoperative day and fluids vasn postoperative day one, he was
weaned off the neosynephrine and epinephrine and hemodynamically
remained stable.  The amiodarone was stopped due to slow
junctional rhythm at rate of 50.  He remained on propofol while
intubated and postoperative day two he was weaned and extubated
from the ventilator.  He was started on betablockers when he was
in atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate 70-80, and started
on ace inhibitor for blood pressure management.  The physical
therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. On postoperative day three
he was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
He continued to progress, EP was consulted for rhythm management
with plan for betablockers at this time and potential
cardioversion and amiodarone in one month.  His epicardial wires
were cut due to low platelet count and he was restarted on
coumadin for his atrial fibrillation.  He was ready for
discharge to rehab on post operative day five to the [**Location (un) 744**] in
[**Location (un) **].

Coumadin at hospital - received 2mg coumadin - INR 1.3 [**6-28**], 5mg

2 mg - INR 1.8 [**7-1**]

Plan from EP for treatment of atrial fibrillation from OMR note
[**6-30**]
76 yo male with history of CAD, atrial fibrillation, and MVP/MR
s/p MV repair/CABGx1(LIMA->LAD)/MAZE/LAA resection on [**3401-6-26**].
Patient had successful repair of mitrial valve and persistent
atrial fibrillation with adequate ventricular response.  At this
point the patient is asymptomatic, rate controlled with
Metoprolol and anti-coagulated with Warfarin (INR
subtherapeutic).  Goal will be to revert to sinus rhythm,
however
we do not want to cardiovert this patient in the post-op period
without adequate anti-coagulation
--continue anti-coagulation with Warfarin
--after 4 weeks will initiate Amiodarone 400mg PO daily
--plan for DC Cardioversion in 5 weeks - we will arrange this
procedure
--follow up with surgery/primary cardiologist as scheduled
