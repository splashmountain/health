PRELIMINARY REPORT


REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Left-sided chest pain and low saturation
in a patient
after CABG.

Portable AP chest radiograph compared to 10:03 a.m. the same
date and to [**5-28**], [**3336**].

The Swan- Ganz was removed in the meantime interval. The heart
is mildly
enlarged in comparison to the previous film but markedly
enlarged in
comparison to [**3337-5-28**], exam done immediately after
operation. The
mediastinum is widened now more than on two previous films.

The bilateral pleural effusion is slightly increased on the left
and unchanged
on the right. The mediastinum is widened.

There is no evidence of congestive heart failure. The left lower
lobe
consolidation is due to atelectasis.

IMPRESSION:
1. Widening of the mediastinum and enlarged heart size. These
findings may
be due to increased pericardial effusion and mediastinal
bleeding.Clinical
correlation is required.
2. Left lower lobe consolidation due to atelectasis, unchanged.
3. These findings were paged to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **].
DR. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1924**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1925**]

TEE Conclusions :
Pre bypass: The left atrium is mildly dilated and elongated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There is focal calcification of
the sinotubular junction. There are scattered, small (<5 mm)
nonmobile plaques in the proximal ascending aorta. The ascending
aorta is borderline dilated, measuring 3.5 cm at its greatest
diameter, but averaging 3-3.2 cm. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets
are myxomatous. Mild (1+) central mitral regurgitation is seen.
Mitral regurgitation remains mild even with provactive manuvers
such as trendelenburg and increased blood pressures. Pulmonary
vein flow pattern is normal. Mitral annulus measures 3.9 cm.

Post Bypass: Patient is Apaced, on Phenylepherine. Preserved
biventricular function with an LVEF >55%. No wall motion
changes. MR remains mild and central. Aortic contours are
intact. Remaining exam reviewed and unchanged. Findings
discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted on [**5-28**] and underwent CABG x3 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 259**].
Transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on neo and propofol
drips. Extubated overnight and neo weaned off on POD #1. He had
some hypoxia and oliguria , but was responsive to lasix. Chest
tubes removed without incident. He c/o some chest pain and EKG
showed ? pericarditis, so he was started on a NSAID.Gentle
diuresis continued and he was transferred to the floor to begin
increasing his activity level. Pacing wires removed on POD #3.
He continued to do well and was discharge to home in stable
condition on POD#4.
