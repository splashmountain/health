   Assessment and Plan
   75 yom with multiple risk factors for CAD without prior history p/w
   with anginal events and new LBBB on EKG and NSTEMI with depressed
   cardiac function (EF 20%).  Transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for cath by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **] in anticipation of Cardiac cath.  CKD, CLL, Anemia, and looming
   HD complicate his picture.
   .
   # CP:  Given his risk factors, his atypical chest pain is likely to
   have represented ACS. He initially was well controlled on medical
   management, but subsequently developed recurrent pain, which is now
   controlled on morphine and nitro.   Horrendous 3VD on cath, elevated
   PCWP, CABG indicated as per C-[**Doctor First Name **] recs.  Cath -> 90% prox LAD crossing
   D1, LCX 90% Prox to OM1, and a left dominant system with serial 70%
   lesions in the LPDA.
   - CABG in a week?
    -
   Impression: Right ICA with <40% stenosis.
   Left ICA with <40% stenosis.
    No need to fix before surgery
   - on asa, heparin gtt, lipitor, BB
   - pre-CABG workup
 carotids, ABI
s today
   - If CP call C-[**Doctor First Name 204**]
   .
   # decompensated LV dysfunction: CXR and TTE at OSH reporting worsened
   CHF with EF of 25%. Currently euvolemic on exam, after lasix ggt.
   Likely precipitant is an ischemic event given above presentation.
   ECHO here yesterday showed, Ef 20-25%, CI-1.95, PASP
 34-60, LVH with
   Global hypokinesis, mild AR, mild MR, small cicumferential pericardial
   effusion.
   - Continue lasix with milrinone given very high PCWP
 lasix currently
   at 10,
   - monitor I/O keep (-) 1L today
   - on BB
   - UOP has tapered off, creatinine has bumped
   .
   # LBBB: Noted on initial presentation to OSH, on [**2508-12-7**]. Now appears
   resolved. Unclear if this was really new, since the only comparison is
   from 07.
   - monitor on tele
   .
   # Pulm/SOB: most likely CHF, although has h/o COPD, so perhaps mixed
   picture. Less likely infective, but given levofloxacin at OSH
   presumably for leucocytosis and concern for CAP.
   - nebs, O2, will d/c levo and monitor for fever/leukocytosis.
   .
   # CKD:  Creatinine has been upward trending since his admission, unsure
   of the baseline Creatinine prior to OSH. Likely secondary to poor
   forward flow.   FeNa <1, FeUrea-25% = Pre-Renal, low flow
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - monitor I/O
 output greatly improved with milrinone and lasix though
   tapering off now
   - started Phoslo
   - continue Procrit
   - f/u renal recs.
       - No HD for now, place A-V fistula at time of surgery
   - creatinine has bumped with diuresis
   .
   Claudication- Precludes IABP
   .
   CLL: doing very well on chlorambucil, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11389**] aware, would like to
   discuss with him today.
   -          No Chlorambucil prior to surgery
   -          Onc [**Last Name (un) **] for CBC/Diff, Ig, smear
   -          f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]

   Anemia:
   Chronic, on epo, adding iron
   .
   # HTN: controlled

   # DM: on levimer and aspart SSI

   FEN: replete lytes
