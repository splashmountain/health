   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   1. Respiratory failure, with hypoxemia and hypercapnia
   Her respiratory distress is very likely multifactorial, with
   contributions from pulmonary edema and pleural effusions. Poor rate
   control could be worsening her breathlessness. Her lung mets might also
   be contributory, as could pulmonary hypertension. Pna possible clinical
   evidence less compelling - she does carry dx of achalasia which would
   put potentially increase her risk of aspiration. Also think PE is less
   likely.
   - Will continue diuresis on lasix drip with goal -1 to 2L daily as she
   is still likely total body volume overloaded. She is currently
   responding well to her lasix drip. Will hold off on adding
   thiazide-type diuretic at this point. Will tolerate rise in creatinine
   at this point as volume seems to be her primary problem. Renal
   consulted in CCU, recommendations appreciated regarding
   ?ultrafiltration
   - If develops increasing respiratory distress will reattempt BiPAP as
   tolerated. Per discussion with transferring team, patient had agreed to
   limited trial of intubation if necessary. Intubation may be technically
   difficult per anesthesiology.
   - Ok to continue vancomycin and zosyn for now given recent temps and
   respiratory distress, will attempt sputum gram stain and culture if she
   can expectorate any sputum, check legionella urinary antigen though
   probably low yield at this point.
   - Follow I/O, daily weight, [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Aspiration precautions
   - Given coagulopathy will hold off on thoracentesis for now
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Plan for diuresis and monitoring as above. Although her EF was measured
   within the normal range, she does have at least moderate MR on her
   echocardiogram which would decrease her effective forward output.
   Optimizing rate control of her atrial fibrillation may also be helpful
   allowing for increased filling time. Cardiology recommendations
   appreciated.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Rate moderately well controlled on IV diltiazem; oral agents held in
   setting of BiPAP. Will resume oral diltiazem and follow closely - her
   absoption of PO meds may be decreased secondary to gut edema. Hold
   anticoagulation given supratherapeutic INR today.
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   Low grade temps, may be secondary to a pneumonia but in setting of
   foley would also consider UTI. No obvious infection at her PICC site or
   diarrhea to suggest C. difficile colitis.
   -          check blood, urine, and sputum cultures along with stool C.
   difficile toxin if she has diarrhea
 COAGULOPATHY
   Possible secondary to malnutrition and antibiotic decrease in vitamin K
   levels. No evidence for DIC on labs. Repleted with vitamin K today.
   Will trend INR daily, resume warfarin for INR<2.5.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Cover with insulin sliding scale, qachs fingerstick target <150
 THYROID CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   suppressed TSH
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Most likely due to diuresis leading to pre-renal state. Willing to
   tolerate moderate rise in creatinine due to need for volume removal.
   Urinalysis, check urine lytes.
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Continue home Pentasa for Crohns
   h/o thyroid CA s/p cyberknife
   TSH recently checked [**11-27**] and suppressed at 0.07. might have
   thyroiditis post radiation which could potentially exacerbate her
   atrial fibrillation. repeat tsh and free T4.
