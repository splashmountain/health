Brief Hospital Course:
Taken to OR [**3027-7-27**] for orthotopic (piggyback)deceased donor
liver transplant pv-pv, cbd-cbd, no t-tube. He received 3,300 of
crystalloid, 3units FFP, 2units of RBC, 2 units of plts and 1
cryo. EBL was 300. See operative report. Given induction
immunosuppression (Simulect, Cellcept, and Solumedrol). A duplex
of the liver demonstrated "Unremarkable post-transplant liver
ultrasound and Doppler." He was transferred to SICU postop
intubated and stable.

On POD 1 sedation was decreased with goal to extubate. Lungs
were clear. Hct was 25.4. He was transfused with 4 units of PRBC
and 1 unit of plts. JP 1 drained 385 and JP # 2 110cc.
Solumedrol 250m and Cellcept 1gram [**Hospital1 12**] were given. On POD 2,
temperature was 101.7. Blood and urine cultures were done and
subsequently negative. JP 1 drained 1245 and #2 55. He was
extubated. Prograf was initiated in addition to cellcept and a
daily solumedrol tapering dose for immunosuppression. Liver
duplex was normal. Pain was managed with dilaudid prn. Alt 222,
ast 191, alk phos 98 and t.bili 3.7.

LFTs trended down until POD 4 when alk phos started to increase
to 368. On POD 4, he received Simulect 20mg IV. The lateral JP
and NG were removed and diet was advanced to sips of clears. He
became dyspneic and dropped 02 sat to 88% on RA. A 70% face mask
was applied with O2 sat that increased to 98%. Wheezing and
decreased breath sounds were noted on the right.  ABGs,CXR and
EKG were done. He was given albuterol neb treatment with
improvement of O2 sat. ABG was 7.32/48/75/26/-1. CXR revealed
small bilateral pleural effusions that were stable. EKG was
stable.  He was treated with IV lasix 40 [**Hospital1 12**] for volume
overload. O2 remained at 92% on 5L face tent.He continued to
receive albuterol neb treatments every 2-4 hours. He diuresed,
but PAO2 continued at 68 and PC02 53. Diamox was added. He
diuresed 4290cc with repeat ABG of 7.35/54/83/31/12 and
decreased wheezing. He required hand restraints for some
confusion and pulling off O2.

On POD 5, alk phos increased to 572 and t.bili to 3.1. A duplex
of the liver demonstrated  " interval development of a new fluid
collection just deep to the left lobe of the liver extending
into the left porta. The collection contains fluid and solid
components, with septations. It measures 5.9 x 5.7 x 3.2 cm.
Aside from this collection, the left lobe parenchyma is normal
in appearance. There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal
dilatation. In addition, there is a second collection found in
the right subhepatic region. This collection contains fluid and
some echogenic material that may represent clot. This collection
measures 7.5 x 3.0 x 4.7 cm. The parenchyma of the right lobe is
normal in appearance, without biliary ductal dilatation. A right
pleural effusion with associated atelectasis is noted."
Arterial/venous flow and resistive indices were normal. Prograf
level was 19.4 and prograf was held x 4 doses. Repeat prograf
level was 7.8 and prograf was resumed at 1mg [**Hospital1 12**] on POD7. He was
given 2 bags of platelets for a plt count of 68. A HIT antibody
was sent. Medial JP was removed.

On POD 7, he was coughing and raising thick, green sputum. He
remained in the SICU for close management of respiratory and
mental status. He had episodes of somnolence and confusion. At
times, he appeared to be hallucinating. Pain medication was
decreased.

On POD 8, he was transferred to the transplant unit. Diet was
advanced and PT continued to work with him. He required a 1:1
sitter as he was agitated, and pulling at IV lines and removing
O2 tubing. Foley was removed. Percocet was decreased for
sedation.

On POD 9, he received Pamidronate x1. Calcium and vitamin D were
started. Alk phos increased to 566. A repeat duplex revealed ".
Patent portal vein, with most probably slight narrowing in the
anastomotic site, demonstrating velocity gradient of uncertain
significance.
2. Unchanged subhepatic and left intrahepatic small fluid
collections." Prograf was increased for a level of 10.4.

ON POD 11 ([**8-8**]), a liver biopsy was performed. This
demonstrated "Features indeterminate for acute cellular
rejection.
Focal minimal lobular inflammation, nonspecific.
Focal poorly formed histiocytic aggregate, suggestive of
granuloma". Prograf was decreased to 1.5mg [**Hospital1 12**] for a level of
13.5. Prednisone remained at 20mg and cellcept at 1gram [**Hospital1 12**]. A
[**Last Name (un) 124**] consult was obtained for elevated glucoses. These were
treated with sliding scale insulin. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 124**] recommendations,
Prandin 1mg [**Hospital1 12**] prior to meals was started.

On POD 13, he was alert and ambulatory. O2 sats were in the high
90's on room air. Lungs were clear. He was tolerating a regular
diet and vital signs were stable. Hct trended down to 25.1. AST
was 24, alt 40, alk phos 340 and t.bili 1.5. VNA ([**Location (un) 2419**]
Home Care) was set up to assist with medication and
insulin/glucose management as well as PT for strengthening and
safety training. A rolling walker was provided for unsteady
gait. His mother arranged for time off from work in order to
provide 24 hour supervision as he did display poor safety
awareness and judgement. Incision was clean and dry. There was
extensive ecchymosis on right side of abdomen and flank. He was
discharged home [**3027-8-10**] with scheduled f/u appointments at the
Transplant office.
