Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 20843**]
Chief Complaint:
vision changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NGT placement

History of Present Illness:
58 y.o. M with ESRD on HD (last HD [**First Name3 (LF) 473**] [**2769-8-1**]), s/p kidney
transplant x 2 ([**2752**], [**2760**])with progressive renal disease,
chronic rejection and renal failure (listed for kidney
transplant, but inactive due to underlying liver cirrhosis), HCV
c/b cirrhosis and ascites (requiring serial therpeutic
paracentesis), PVD, CHF (EF 45%, systolic and diastolic
dysfunction), labile HTN with recent admissions ([**2769-2-20**],
[**2769-6-22**]) for hypertensive emergency requiring labetolol gtts,
who presented to ED with visual changes.
.
Patinet reports that he's had nonpainful visual changes for 7
days described as a "shade coming over his eye". Patient also
reports seeing people in the periphery of his right eye. Patient
found to be hypertensive to 221/107 and started on Nipride gtt
with additional 10 iv & 50 PO of Hydral and responded well with
resultant BPs in the 140's. Patinet also seen by Ophtho who
thought that the visual changes were likely due to acute optic
nerve ischemia in setting of hypertension. Head CT was negative
for intracranial process and CXR was negative as well.
.
Patient denies any headache, chest pain, sob, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Patient reports that he takes his
medications regularly, although can't say that he hasn't missed
any doses of his medications.

Of note, patient has been treated for ~1 week of Valtrex for
zoster on the Left thigh.

.
Studies:
.
CT w/o contrast on [**8-2**]: There has been no change in the
appearance of the brain compared with prior study. There is no
evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of
midline structures, or loss of [**Doctor Last Name **]-white differentiation. Areas
of white matter hypodensity are again noted and are unchanged.
The posterior fossa is unchanged, with slight prominence of
extra-axial space. Calcification of the cavernous carotids again
noted. The paranasal sinuses are clear. There is again noted to
be partial opacification of the left mastoid air cells.
.
CXR [**8-2**]: Cardiomegaly, bibasilar atelectasis. No acute
intrathoracic process.
.
MRA NECK W/O CONTRAST, MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST, MRA BRAIN W/O
CONTRAST [**8-5**]:
1. No acute infarcts.
2. Moderate degree of small vessel ischemic changes.
3. MRA of the neck is limited due to patient motion, but no
gross abnormalities are seen.
.
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN, DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL [**8-6**]:
1. Moderate perihepatic ascites.
2. Cholelithiasis.
3. Patent hepatic vasculature with normal directional flow and
waveforms.
4. Splenomegaly.
.
EEG [**8-7**]: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine
sampling and spike and seizure detection programs demonstrated
several
episodes of brief generalized polyspike and wave discharges as
well as
several multifocal spike and wave discharges. The discharges
were never
repetitive or sustained. In addition, the background rhythm was
slow
and disorganized, typically achieving a maximum frequency of 7
Hz. The
first finding suggests a potential for ongoing epileptogenesis.
The
second is suggestive of an underlying encephalopathy which could
be due
to deeper midline or subcortical dysfunction.


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE.
Assessment:
58M with h/o epilepsy, ESRD on HD s/p 2 failed kidney
tranplants, HCV cirrhosis, PVD, CHF, labile hypertension
admitted with hypertensive emergency  and nonarteric ischemic
optic neuropathy (R eye).  Pt originally presented to the ED c/o
decreased vision in his R eye, and was found to have BPs in the
220s/110s.  Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient also had
acutely altered mental status thought to be due to hepatic
encephalopathy.  During his MICU stay, the pt was transitioned
to po BP meds with goal SBPs of 140-180s.  The patient did have
a seizure thought to be due to missing 1-2 doses of seizure meds
while encephalopathic, but now is back on his po anti-seizure
regimen. Neuro and Hepatology follow the patient. Please see the
problem based plan for details.
.
Plan:
.
# AMS: hypertensive encephalopathy vs. hepatic encephalopathy
vs. uremic encephalophy medication side effects vs. prolonged
post-ictal state. h/o epilepsy on Keppra and Lamictal on
admission.  AMS shortly after admission to MICU thought to be
secondary to Perocet given for H. Zoster or olanzapine given for
sleep. Also new dysarthria, slurred speech.  Seizure yesterday
appearing partial with sterotypical movements of chin and hand.
MRI/MRA without contrast of neck and head negative. Hepatology
consult assessed pt has grade [**1-25**] encephalophy. U/S liver showed
normal vasculature and normal directional flow. Altered mental
status thought to be due to encephalopathy compounded by
prolonged post-ictal state.  Marked improvement with lactulose
and rifaximin. Pt is now alert and oriented.  Patient was
continued on lactulose and rifaximin.  Started on dilantin per
neuro recs.  He will be followed up by Dr.[**First Name (STitle) 205**] from neurology
and Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 399**] from liver service as out patient.
.
# Rectal bleeding- BRBPR s/p PR lactulose in ICU. Bleeding to
soak 2 chucks. Controlled with tamponade with Foley catheter per
GI recommendation.  HCT remains stable.  Trace positive stools
in ED.  Currently hemodynamically stable with no repeat guaiac
positive stools in unit.  Possible due to underlying
hemorrhoids, although may be secondary to bowel hypoperfusion.
Lactate in ED was 1.2, not suggestive of mesenteric ischemia.
Colonoscropy [**6-24**] showing grade 1 hemorrhoids, diverticulosis,
no polyps.  Endoscopy [**8-28**] showing grade IV esophagitis with
ulcerations. plyps in the distal bulb. Polyps c/w esophagitis,
duodenitis. Colonoscopy [**12-29**] showing grade 2 hemorrhoids and
no rectal varies, minimal blood loss precipitated by lactulose
enema.  His HCT remained stable on discharge.
.
# HTN Emergency - Unclear of patient compliance with medications
with evidence of end organ ishcemia to his right eye.  Patient
responded well to Nipride gtt with goal SBP <170 in ED.  Pt
briefly on Labetolol gtt in ICU, as he responded to this in the
past and will avoid possible CN toxicity; however, patient's BP
was well controlled with restart of home PO BP meds.  Not able
to follow UOP as patient is on HD. Patient was discharged on
lisinopril, metoprolol and clonidine patch.
.
# Herpes Zoster - Patient has had occasional L flank pain
preceeding the vesicles in the distribution of L2-3.  Patient
initially written for acyclovir 1g x 5 days (Day 1 [**2769-7-31**]), and
completed the course. Pt. not c/o Zoster pain currently.
Discharged on morphine PRN.
.
# Right eye optic nerve ischemia - Patient seen by Ophtho in ED.
 Guarded to poor prognosis in terms of regaining vision and will
follow up in clinic next week (would be [**8-9**]).  No intervention
needed at this time.  Patient also developed superficial
keratitis and was prescribed erythromycin ointment by ophtho.
Will be f/u with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] as out pt.
.
#. CAD: Patient without evidence of ischemia.
-PUMP: Known EF of 45%.  On aggressive outpatient
antihypertensive regimen, thought to be due to renal disease
-RHYTHM:  No issues at this point.
-continued on out pt ASA and Plavix
.
# Hyperkalemia -
-corrected with HD
.
# ESRD on HD: To HD on M/W/F via R Hickman catheter.  Appreciate
renal recs.  Patient has bilateral nonfunctioning AV fistulas in
forearms.
.
# Anemia - [**1-24**] chronic renal disease: Hct baseline 30. Patient
stable as mentioned above.
.
# Hyperparathyroidism: Continued oupatient dose of Cinacalcet
HCl.
.
# PVD s/p bilateral common iliac stents: continued aspirin and
plavix per outpatient regimen.
.
# Epilepsy: h/o primary generalized epilepsy since childhood
with h/o paroxysmal episodes of confusion due to nonconvulsive
seizures.  Will continue outpatient meds of keppra and
lamotrigine. Loaded on dilantin s/p seizure, and continued
thereafter. Getting extra dose of dilantin after HD. Will be
followed up by Dr.[**First Name (STitle) 205**] as out pt.
