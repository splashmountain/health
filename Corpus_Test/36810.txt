Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2574**]
Chief Complaint:
worsening shortness of breath, recurrent pericardial effusion
found on routine echo

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardial window ([**2850-2-10**])


History of Present Illness:
72M with PMH of DM, AFib on coumadin, and RA complicated by
pericardial effusion and tamponade in [**6-19**], transferred from
[**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) **] for further evaluation and management of recurrent
pericardial effusion and tamponade seen on routine repeat echo.
.
Patient had past admission on [**6-13**]/09 for fatigue, edema,
and decreased exercise tolerance. Found to have pericardial
effusion, underwent pericardiocentesis with removal 300 cc clear
slightly blood-tinged pericardial fluid, with decrease in
pericardial pressure from 26 to 10 mmHg. Patient also underwent
pericardial drain placement. Pericardial fluid culture and
cytology returned negative. Fluid analysis revealed WBC# 6100
(81% PMN), RBC [**Numeric Identifier 33673**] TP 5.1 albumin 2.9 gluc 4 LDH 4230. The
effusion was attributed to RA, but methotrexate was discontinued
(and prednisone increased from 20 to 30 mg daily) in case the
former was contributing.
.
Routine follow-up TTE today at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) **] showed a small to
moderate mainly anterior pericardial effusion with diastolic
right ventricular collapse suggestive of tamponade. Transferred
to the [**Hospital1 22**] ED for further management, where triage V/S 98 125
138/83 18 94%RA. HR 101 without intervention. Labs notable for
INR 3.7, Hct 30.5. EKG showed low voltage in the limb leads. CXR
showed only bibasilar linear atelectasis. Vital signs prior to
transfer 95 132/87 20 97%RA.
.
On the floor, patient is feeling relatively well. Reports having
some shortness of breath, but is at his baseline due to his
COPD. Denies any chest pain, worsening SOB, orthopnea,
palpitations, headache, lightheadedness, dizziness.

Echocardiogram ([**2850-2-7**])
FINDINGS:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial
effusion. There is right ventricular diastolic collapse,
consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.

IMPRESSION:
Limited study,. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
low normal. A small to moderate mainly anterior pericardial
effusion is present with diastolic right ventricular collapse
suggestive of tamponade.
Reffering physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 10939**].

Additional In-house Read:
Small amount of pericardial fluid and no evidence of RV
diastolic collapse.
.
ECHO [**2850-2-12**]
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - bandages,
defibrillator pads or electrodes. Suboptimal image quality -
body habitus. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm.
.
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is probably normal although views are
technically suboptimal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no
valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is
likely related to high cardiac output. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen
(within normal limits). There is a trivial pericardial effusion.

.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2849-7-9**],
the pericardial effusion is now smaller.
.
AP Chest [**2850-2-13**]
Study is limited as the lung bases have been excluded from the
field of view. There is again seen some streaky densities at the
bases most consistent with subsegmental atelectasis which is
unchanged. The upper lung fields are clear without focal
consolidation or signs of overt pulmonary edema. Cardiac
silhouette is unchanged, within normal limits.
.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2850-2-7**] 6:28 PM
UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Cardiac silhouette is normal in
size. The
mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary
vascularity is
normal. Linear opacities within both lung bases are compatible
with linear
atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is
visualized. No acute skeletal abnormalities are seen.

IMPRESSION: Bibasilar linear atelectasis. No acute
cardiopulmonary
abnormality otherwise visualized.
.
CXR [**2850-2-14**]
IMPRESSION: Heterogeneous opacification at both lung bases has
improved since
[**2-12**], probably atelectasis. On the left, it is conceivable
that
pneumonia was present and is rapidly clearing, but there is no
new or
worsening consolidation. There is no pulmonary edema, pleural
effusion or
mediastinal widening. Heart size is normal

Brief Hospital Course:
72M with PMH of DM, AFib on coumadin, and RA complicated by
pericardial effusion and tamponade in [**6-19**], presents with
recurrent pericardial effusion concerning of tamponade and
complaints of some progressive shortness of breath.

#. Pericardial effusion - patient has had history of pericardial
effusion in the past, thought to be a complicaton of RA. Had a
pericardiocentesis with drain placement in 5/[**2849**]. Initially had
methotrexate discontinued for concerns of worsening pericardial
effusion, but was restarted back on it in [**Month (only) 718**] when patient did
not tolerate Humira well. Patient has been receiving regular
follow up with his cardiologist with a repeat echo every 6
weeks.  His echo read done at [**Location (un) **] showed a small to moderate
mainly anterior pericardial effusion with evidence of diastolic
right ventricular collapse suggestive of tamponade.  An
additional read done by cardiology service here showed small
amount of fluid with no evidence of RV diastolic collapse.  He
was hemodynamically stable during his admission and breathing
was not labored, although reported to be slightly worse over the
last few weeks.  Pulsus was checked twice a day and remained
consistently around 7-8mmHg.  Methotrexate was held given the
reaccumulation of pericardial fluid.  Patient was evaluated by
thoracic surgery for pericardial window.  Procedure was
performed on [**2850-2-10**] with drainage of only 80cc of fluid and
was complicated by afib with RVR.
The drainage tube was subsequently removed and he is being
followed with serial imaging which at the time of discharge
showed a smaller pericardial effusion on echo and only
atelectasis on CXR. Fluid culture was positive for
propionobacterium acnes which was felt to be a contaminant.
Biopsy from pericardial window showed unremarkable cartilage and
skeletal muscle and fragments of pericardium with chronic
inflammation and fibrin deposition.
.
#. A fib - patient takes warfarin at home, was found to be
supratherapeutic at INR of 3.7 on admission. INR was reversed
for the pericardial window. He was bridged on heparin drip to
coumadin and the coumadin alone was continued once his INR was
therapeutic.
.
#. HTN - patient was continued on home dosage of metoprolol,
furosemide, and spironolactone during admission.  Valsartan was
substituted for his home dose of olmesartan during admission,
but patient was switched back to olmesartan on discharge.
.
# Anemia: he was found to have a microcytic anemia consistent
with anemia of chronic disease. An outpatient colonoscopy can be
considered as an outpatient.
.
#. Hyperlipidemia - patient was continued on home regimen of
pravastatin
.
#. Rheumatoid Arthritis - patient's home regimen of methotrexate
was held for pericardial effusion.  Was restarted on discharge
after his pericardial window procedure.
.
#. COPD - currently at baseline, patient was in no respiratory
distress.  During admission he was maintained on home dose of
spiriva.  Advair was substituted for symbicort while admitted,
but patient was restarted on symbicort on discharge.
.
#. DM - patient was continued on his home regimen of insulin as
well as regular insulin sliding scale.
.
#. GERD - patient was continued on omeprazole
.
#. Glaucoma - patient was continued on prednisolone drop to left
eye and artificial tears

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 37**] for
recurrent pericardial effusion seen on a routine echocardiogram.
 During this admission, we reviewed the echocardiogram that was
performed at [**Location (un) **] and found that while there is some fluid
present, it is not causing any tamponade of your heart.  A
pericardial window was performed by thoracic surgery to help
drain the fluid around your heart and prevent future
reaccumulation.  Please continue to regularly follow up with
your cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], as you have been doing.
.
The following changes were made to your medications.
We CHANGED to:
Metoprolol Tartrate 50mg three times a day.
Diltiazem ER 120mg daily.
.
We STOPPED:
potassium chloride 10meq capsule Sustained release tablet daily.
.
Please continue to follow up in [**Hospital3 2914**] and
change your dosage of warfarin as instructed.
