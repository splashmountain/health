   Assessment and Plan
   79F with severe AS, afib on coumadin, and HTN who presents from rehab
   for evaluation of seizure-like activity, found to have intermittent
   runs of NSVT and admitted to the CCU for further management.
   .
   #. Runs of VT/RHYTHM:  Admitted to CCU for multiple runs of polymorphic
   VT in ED requiring Mg and lidocaine gtt . No recurrent runs since
   admission to the CCU. Has history of afib on coumadin, therapeutic INR.
   Patient with known prolonged QT; reason for this is unknown, and reason
   for progression to torsades also unknown. EP aware.
   - Plan for pacer, however, will need to delay given possible bacteremia
   - Replete lytes aggressively; goal Mg>2.2, K4.5-5.0
   - Have pads in place
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Avoid agents which may prolong QT- Holding mirtazapine given case
   reports of mirtazapine-associated torsade de pointes
   .
   # AS: severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2) on ECHO
   yesterday. Still not totally clear whether symptoms of HF fully
   attributable to AS. Will cont to optimize heart failure regimen at this
   time. Pt has been seen by CT [**Doctor First Name 204**] who would like to hold off on AVR for
   at least 1 month.
   - Cont medical management of CHF as detailed below
   - Need to determine when R/L heart cath will be done
   .
   # Bacteremia: Single bottle growing GPC
s today. Pt given 1 dose vanco.
   Possible this represents contamination but must also consider possible
   sources
recent femur instrumentation vs lines seem most likely.
   -await final cx results
   -cont Vancomycin for now
   .
   #. CORONARIES:  No known history of CAD history. CE neg x2
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Continue ASA 81mg PO daily
   - Holding metoprolol given bradycardia
   .
   #. PUMP: ECHO showed lVEF >55.As noted above, unclear what role AS
   playing in HF symptoms. Appears to be euvolemic at this time.
   - Continue home dose of Lasix 40mg PO daily
> goal of -500 today
   - Daily weights, strict I/Os, fluid restriction
   .
   #. ? Seizure activity:  Unclear if pt actually had sz activity. No
   further episodes since admission.
    - Seizure precautions
   - Monitor closely for repeat activity
   - Follow culture data
   .
   #. UTI:  Urine with >100,000 gram neg rods.
   - Cont ceftriaxone until sensitivities available
   - Follow final urine culture
   .
   #. Anemia:  Hct today 25.5 which is trending down from low 30
s which
   is baseline.
   -  Active T&S
   - Guiac all stools
   - Cont monitor daily Hct
   .
   #. HTN:  Blood pressure currently well controlled.
   - Holding amlodipine at this time
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue statin per home regimen
   .
   #. s/p recent ORIF:  will likely need to return to rehab after
   discharge
   -  Tylenol standing for pain control
