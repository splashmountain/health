HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63 year old
male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass grafting to the posterior descending
artery and left anterior descending artery on [**7-5**]. [**Male First Name (un) 659**] mitral valve replacement also on [**3470-7-5**],
who was transferred to the C-Medicine service for placement
of a DDD pacemaker after he was found to be in complete heart
block with a junctional escape rhythm post coronary artery
bypass grafting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Please refer to dictation dated [**3470-7-13**] by the cardiothoracic surgery service.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Please refer to dictation dated [**3470-7-13**] by the cardiothoracic surgery service.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Please refer to dictation dated [**3470-7-13**]
by the cardiothoracic surgery service.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the C-Medicine
service and underwent DDD pacemaker placement without
complication.  His amiodarone, which was started in
consultation with the electrophysiology service on the [**Hospital Ward Name **], was continued and converted to 200 mg daily to start
on [**3470-7-14**].  The patient will continue on a regimen of
his amiodarone and anticoagulation, and follow up with the
electrophysiology clinic in one month for consideration of
further control of his rhythm.

Co[**Last Name (STitle) 2924**] artery disease:  The patient is status post coronary
artery bypass grafting with no ischemic symptoms.  He will
continue on aspirin, beta blocker and lisinopril.  The
patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in approximately
two weeks.

Status post mitral valve replacement:  The patient continues
on Coumadin 4 mg daily and will be discharged on Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneously twice a day until he is fully
anticoagulated.

Neurologic:  The patient had delirium status post multiple
medications postoperatively.  A head CT was performed on [**3470-7-13**] which showed old infarctions in the region of the
left caudate, right internal capsule and right cerebellar
hemisphere as well as atrophy out of proportion to age.  The
patient was evaluated by physical therapy and occupational
therapy with regard to home safety, and felt that he would be
safe at home as long as family was observing him and closely
involved.  His posterior delirium was clearing at the time of
discharge but, if this persists, given his history of strokes
in the past, the patient was advised to seek formal
neurologic follow-up as referred by his primary care
physician in [**Name9 (PRE) 1368**].

Pulmonary:  The patient has a history of mild chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and will continue on an
albuterol meter dose inhaler as needed.  The patient will
need outpatient pulmonary function tests given the initiation
of amiodarone, if these were not already done.

Gastrointestinal:  The patient will need follow-up of his
liver function tests on amiodarone, by his primary care
physician.

Endocrine:  The patient will need his TSH followed while on
amiodarone, by his primary care physician.

Anticoagulation:  The patient will be discharged on Coumadin
4 mg daily to crossover with Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneously
twice a day for his mitral valve replacement.

DI[**Last Name (STitle) 2925**]ION:  The patient will be discharged to home on [**3470-7-15**] to follow up with cardiothoracic surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1869**], in approximately two weeks, to follow up with his
primary care physician in [**Name9 (PRE) 1368**], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2926**], in one
week, and to follow up with neurology as referred by Dr.
