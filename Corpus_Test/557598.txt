Chief Complaint:  SOB
   HPI:
   Ms. [**Known patient lastname 3250**] is an 83 year old woman with diastolic heart failure, atrial
   fibrillation, and thyroid cancer with pulmonary metastases who
   presented to [**Hospital1 1**] on [**11-25**] with DOE, weight gain, orthopnea, and PND.
   In the ED, she was hypotensive at 80/54 and was in rapid atrial
   fibrillation with a HR in the 130's. She was treated [**Last Name (un) 3251**] esmolol,
   neosynephrine, and digoxin and admitted to the CCU for further
   management.
   .
   In the CCU, she was placed on a lasix drip
   She was transferred to the cardiology floor on [**12-3**], where she later
   developed hypercarbic respiratory failure and was placed on BiPAP. She
   was readmitted to the CCU and has been intermittently on and off BiPAP
   since that time. She was empirically started on vancomycin and zosyn
   for possible HAP on [**12-4**].

   There is little radiographic change, moderate cardiomegaly,

   as well as left lower lobe collapse are stable. Pulmonary vasculature
   is borderline enlarged but there is no appreciable edema. Status of the
   right lower lobe is difficult to assess, because of superimposition of
   pleural opacity. Its radiographic appearance was similar on the CTA
   scout [**11-27**] when it was collapsed. No pneumothorax.

   Assessment and Plan
   This 83F with multiple medical comorbidities including atrial
   fibrillation, CHF, and pulmonary metastases from thyroid cancer was
   admitted with worsened dyspnea and weight gain.
   1. Respiratory failure, with hypoxemia and hypercapnia
   Her respiratory distress is very likely multifactorial, with
   contributions from pulmonary edema (probably cardiogenic) and pleural
   effusions. Poor rate control could be worsening her breathlessness. Her
   lung mets might also be contributory, as could pulmonary hypertension.
   Pna possible clinical evidence less compelling - though she does carry
   dx of achalasia which would potentially increase her risk of
   aspiration. Also think PE is less likely.
   - Will continue diuresis on lasix drip with goal -1 to 2L daily as she
   is still likely total body volume overloaded. She is currently
   responding well to her lasix drip. Will hold off on adding
   thiazide-type diuretic at this point. Will tolerate rise in creatinine
   at this point as volume seems to be her primary problem. Renal
   consulted in CCU, recommendations appreciated regarding
   ?ultrafiltration
   - If develops increasing respiratory distress will reattempt BiPAP as
   tolerated. Per discussion with transferring team, patient had agreed to
   limited trial of intubation if necessary. Intubation may be technically
   difficult per anesthesiology.
   - Ok to continue vancomycin and zosyn for now given recent temps and
   respiratory distress, will attempt sputum gram stain and culture if she
   can expectorate any sputum, check legionella urinary antigen though
   probably low yield at this point.
   - Follow I/O, daily weight, [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Aspiration precautions
   - Given coagulopathy will hold off on thoracentesis for now
   2. CHF, diastolic, acute on chronic
   Plan for diuresis and monitoring as above. Although her EF was measured
   within the normal range, she does have at least moderate MR on her
   echocardiogram which would decrease her effective forward output.
   Optimizing rate control of her atrial fibrillation may also be helpful
   allowing for increased filling time. Cardiology recommendations
   appreciated.
   3. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate moderately well controlled on IV diltiazem; oral agents held in
   setting of BiPAP. Will resume oral diltiazem and follow closely - her
   absoption of PO meds may be decreased secondary to gut edema. Hold
   anticoagulation given supratherapeutic INR today.
   4. Fevers
   Low grade temps, may be secondary to a pneumonia but in setting of
   foley would also consider UTI. No obvious infection at her PICC site or
   diarrhea to suggest C. difficile colitis.
   - check blood, urine, and sputum cultures along with stool C. difficile
   toxin if she has diarrhea
   5. Elevated INR
   Possible secondary to malnutrition and antibiotic decrease in vitamin K
   levels. No evidence for DIC on labs. Repleted with vitamin K today.
   Will trend INR daily, resume warfarin for INR<2.5.
   6. Acute renal failure
   Most likely due to diuresis leading to pre-renal state. Willing to
   tolerate moderate rise in creatinine due to need for volume removal.
   Urinalysis, check urine lytes.
   7. Crohns
   Continue home Pentasa.
   8. DM
   Cover with insulin sliding scale, qachs fingerstick target <150
   FEN replete K>4, Mag>2. diabetic diet, low sodium
   Access PICC, will place A line
