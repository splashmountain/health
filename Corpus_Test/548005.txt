   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo M w/ ESRD, CAD, CVA, CHF (EF 30%) presents with syncopal episodes
   at HD for 1 month prior to admission.  Persistent HOTN and the
   inability to tolerate dialysis led to a MICU transfer.  He did not
   respond to volume removal on CVVH and has been mostly norepinephrine
   requiring to tolerate runs of CVVH.
 SHOCK, OTHER - etiology remains unclear, now off NE since 10AM [**11-30**],
   no source of infection identified despite low grade fevers.
   Cardiogenic shock seems unlikely given exam (warm)
   - cont midodrine, digoxin

 FEVER - low grade, no source identified, All clx have been neg. Will
   likely perform a thoracentesis
   - remains on meropenem ([**11-28**])  though UCx only yeast, arguably his WBC
   has improved and we will cont a course until after thoracentesis
   - Decub film and AP film for effusion with plan for thoracentesis
 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), UPPER EXTREMITY
   - continue heparin drip with plan to start coumadin post thoracentesis
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
   - electrolytes ok, tolerated HD on pressors yesterday
   - trial HD with no pressors  [**12-1**]
   > Thrombocytopenia: new finding. Will repeat CBC to confirm with
   smear.  Does not appear to be consistent with HIT (has been HIT neg),
   TTP or antibody mediated process.
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE
   - continue ASA. statin
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   - rate controlled on digoxin
