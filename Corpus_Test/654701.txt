   Imaging:
   - CXR from [**9-6**]:  ET 3.9 cm above the carina.  Moderate right effusion
   and bilateral alveolar infiltrate that is more confluent and dense on
   today
s study, most marked in the left mid lung.  There is also
   increased infiltrate in the left lower lobe.  Assessment for change in
   infiltrate on the right is made difficult by the layering effusion but
   the infiltrate also looks slightly worse on the right.
   - CXR from [**9-7**]: My read: improvement in bilateral alveolar
   infiltrates.  Improved right sided pleural effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   50 yoF w/ a h/o MVA/T2 paraplegia since [**3418**] and intermittent episodes
   of respiratory failure due to UTIs and pneumonia now admitted with
   hypotension and acute respiratory failure.
   # Sepsis: The patient does not have a clear source for her sepsis.  It
   is possible she has urosepsis given positive U/A.  Blood cultures
   pending.  Alternative source is a possible pneumonia, given history of
   mucous plugging, possible reduced ability to clear secretions secondary
   to her paraplegia.  Also, RLL infiltrate on CXR and 4+ GNR on sputum
   culture.  However this is unchanged from previous films and likely a
   chronic change.
   -fully resusciated for septic picture, attempt to wean levophed
   -SVO2 is 60, but pressors were held.  Given IVF for low CVP
   -based on previous culture data will treat with broad spectrum
   antibiotics with vanc, zosyn, and azithromycin for atypical coverage
   -f/u sputum speciation
   -f/u blood cultures
   -levophed to keep MAP > 65
   -placed a line
   # Hypoxia: as above possibilities include sepsis, pleural effusion,
   pulmonary edema s/p vigorous hydration, and RLL pneumonia.  Pneumonia
   fits with her cough productive of brown sputum.  F/u sputum cx and
   other cx data as above.  Given fever, muscle atrophy in lower
   extremities with decreased lower leg blood flow,  PE is less likely.
   -intubated and sedated; patient awakens at times and appears agitated.
   Will try to increase sedation
   -on AC 380X28
   -try to wean FIO2 or PEEP as tolerated
   # T2 Paraplegia:
   -continue home pain regimen with baclofen, methadone, lyrica.
   -continue home bowel regimen.
   #Hypokalemia: resolved.  intrinsic renal disease vs. potassium wasting
   -replete K with monitoring
