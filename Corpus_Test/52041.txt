Chief Complaint:
rising creatinine

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Renal Biopsy


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 78 y/o female with HTN, DM2, CAD S/P CABG, Afib, ESRD S/P
Renal Transplant, and RAS S/P Angioplasty who is referred in for
workup of rising creatinine, latest value of 3.5 up from last in
our system of 2.5 in mid [**Month (only) **]). She reports no complaints other
than continued left arm and bilateral leg swelling which has
been getting worse over the last month. She also has had some
intching of her back, but denies thirst, nausea, vomiting,
change in frequency/color/odor of urine. She denies headache,
[**Month (only) **], chills, chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, PND,
abdominal pain, graft tenderness, diarrhea, polyuria. She has
not been using any NSAIDS. She did have her metolazone restarted
one week ago and took a dose on thursday and saturday because of
worsening leg edema. Her furosemide dose has been stable. Her
potassium was changed from daily to [**Hospital1 9**] last week as well. She
was started back on allopurinol about a month ago. Otherwise on
changes in her health and she has actually been feeling well.

.
RENAL ULTRASOUND: IMPRESSION: Unchanged overall appearance of
renal transplant with marked upper pole cortical thinning and
underlying focal hydronephrosis. Doppler examination
demonstrates relatively normal venous flow and preserved
systolic and diastolic arterial flow, though the latter is low
in amplitude, as before. The renal artery shows slightly
broadened spectral waveforms, with normal parenchymal resistive
indices, ranging from 0.54 to 0.62 in the mid- and lower poles;
these results are not significantly changed compared to prior
exams. The preserved brisk arterial upstroke would militate
against significant re-stenosis of the stented renal artery.

However, though the Doppler evaluation of the upper pole
parenchyma is limited, the elevated RIs, which appear new, in
the setting of rising creatinine, raise the possibility of
chronic rejection. This may need to be addressed directly, by
renal biopsy.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 77 y/o Female with HTN, DM2, CAD S/P CABG, Afib, ESRD S/P
Renal Transplant, and RAS S/P Angioplasty with rising creatinine
and elevated blood pressure, but asymptomatic.
.
1. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Likely etiology of rising
creatinine is worsening of her chronic kidney disease due to
hypertensive nephrosclerosis and diabetic nephropathy. Urine
studies were consistent with an intrinsic cause of renal failure
and patient had nephrotic range proteinuria. Renal transplant
ultrasound with Dopplers was negative for RAS and showed normal
venous flow. Serum protein and urine protein had been negative
in [**Month (only) **]. The patient's diuretics were held for concern of
renal hypoperfusion. Prograf levels were followed and were
within therapeutic range, making renal failure secondary to
prograf unlikely.
-
2. Hypertension: Blood pressure was elevated while in hospital
and patient's medications were changed to correct this. We
increased her labetalol to 200mg, amlodipine was increased to
10mg and clonidine was increased to 0.2mg tid.
-
3. Leg Edema: Has normal EF, so possibly diastolic failure vs.
worsening renal disease. Etiology is most likely anasarca
secondary to protein losing nephropathy. However, patient's
diuretics were held.

-
4. Right Basilar Decreased breath sounds: Likely pleural
effusion. Doubt PNA given lack of cough, sputum, fevers. CXR
unread but appears to have stable chronic R sided effusion. As
appears stable otherwise, patient was not treated at this time.

-
5. Irregular rate: Hx of Afib, not on coumadin. On ECG, NSR with
PAC's, LVH and RBBB.
- continue beta blocker as well rate controlled
- coumadin has been held because of diverticular bleed requiring
hemicolectomy
-
6. DM Type II:
- diabetic diet
- regular insulin sliding scale
-
7. CAD s/p CABG and stenting: No chest pain.
- cont beta blocker and statin
- not on aspirin or plavix, unclear when last stent was put in,
but possibly stopped because of bleed.
-
8. Diastolic Dysfunction: Pt was continued on antihypertensives
with good effect.
-
9. Secondary Hyperparathyroidism: Pt was continued on
calcitriol. PTH level was checked and remained elevated. Calcium
levels were within normal.

-
10. Hypothyroidism: Continued on home regimen of levothyroxine;
TSH elevated but free T4 normal
-
11. Anemia: Likely ACD from renal disease. HCT was stable with
no evidence of bleeding.
-
12. h/o Gout: Allopurinol was held in house
-
