   Assessment and Plan
   73 year old male with DM2, HTN, hyperlipedemia who presented with 10/10
   substernal chest pain underwent successful PTCA and stenting of the LCX
   with a 3.5x15mm Xience stent. Then transferred to the CCU in the
   setting of persistent chest pain after cardiac catherization. Underwent
   repeat cath with code blue on the table at which time he was found to
   have LAD stenosis which was stented.
   .
   # NSTEMI/CAD - patient with 3 vessel disease with LMCA no angiography
   apparent CAD, LAD with mid vessel 60 % stenosis, LCx with proximal
   eccentric 80% hazy, mild luminal irregularities, RCA proximal 60 %
   focal and distal 60%, mild luminal irregularities throughout. Patient
   s/p LCX with a 3.5x15mm Xience stent with persistent chest pain which
   led to re-cath on the following morning. At cath LAD was found to be
   90% occluded and a DES was placed.
   - cont Plavix, aspirin 325mg PO daily, atorvastatin 80 mg PO daily for
   now for ACS
   - Lipid panel: Cholest 111, Triglyc 209, HDL 32, LDLcalc 45 so at goal
   - HbA1c pending for risk statification
   - uptitrated beta blocker to 12.5mg PO TID but went back to [**Hospital1 7**] dosing
   for bradycardia
   - off IV heparin now, off IV nitro
   - completed Integrillin drip
   - telemetry monitoring overnight showed ? Mobitz II
   - CK peaked at  729 and downtrending prior to second cath
   .
   # Pump- on cardiac catherization normal systolic function. No evidence
   of heart failure on exam.  Patient denies symptoms such as orthopnea,
   lower extremity edema.
   - echo pending
   - Holding lisinopril for renal protection after 2 caths and contrast CT
   - will restart on discharge
   .
   # Rhythm - patient with NSR with Q waves in II, aVF which may be
   consistent with previous infarct. Telemetry overnight demonstrates
   episodes of bradycardia to high 40s with missed beats as well as
   episodes of apnea.
   - f/u repeat EKG
   - continue telemetry monitoring
   - Tele showed dropped beats concerning for vagal response. Not seen on
   12 lead. Will continue to follow and lower Bblocker to [**Hospital1 7**] dosing as
   above
   .
   #  Acute renal failure
 Cr currently 1.6 up from previous baseline of
   1.1 likely secondary to multiple cardiac catherization and CTA of chest
   at OSH.
   - renally dose medications
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - cont mucormyst for post cath prophylaxis
   .
   #. Anemia: Downtrenditng HCT in the setting of volume load and s/p cath
   with bilat groin hematomas.
   - Trend [**Hospital1 7**] for now
   - Femoral US pending
   - Transfuse for HCT < 25.
   .
   # Diabetes - type II diabetes, non-insulin dependent
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - RISS
   - Started glargine 10U SQ qAM for now
   - A1c pending
   .
   # Hypertension - patient maintained on HCTZ and lisinopril as
   outpatient
   - holding lisinopril for renal protection
   - holding HCTZ for renal protection
   - beta blocker as above
   .
   # Pulmonary Nodules: Found on OSH CTA, concerning in setting of colon
   cancer history. Rads recommended 3mo f/u.
   .
   # FEN - cardiac, diabetic diet
