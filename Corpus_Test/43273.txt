24% lymphocytes, 7.4 monocytes, 5.8 eosinophils.  Urinalysis:

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:  This 38-year-old African
American male with a long history of type 1 diabetes
complicated by autonomic neuropathy, chronic renal failure,
coronary artery disease, gastroparesis, and malignant
hypertension requiring multiple admissions recently contact[**Name (NI) **]
and connected with NIH for entering into a
pseudopheochromocytoma study.

1. Hypertension:  Patient was treated with IV labetalol and
hydralazine in the Emergency Room and closely monitored.  He
was transferred to the floor, where he was put on IV doses of
metoprolol as well as IV hydralazine.  Placed on telemetry
for monitoring.  Patient was transitioned over his hospital
stay to p.o. medications.  Blood pressure normalized.  There
were no EKG changes.  Patient was maintained on his blood
pressure medications and discharged normotensive pressures.

2. Nausea and vomiting resolved:  Frequent occurrences of
gastroparesis and autonomic dysfunction may also be related
to his hypertensive CNS symptoms, which was greatly relieved
by a decrease in his blood pressure.  Patient is given
metoclopramide and ondansetron, Ativan prn.  He was started
on p.o. and was tolerating them well prior to his discharge.
Patient did require IV fluid hydration until p.o. could be
tolerated on the day prior to discharge.

3. Cardiac ischemia:  Patient with a history of CAD, MI.
There are no EKG changes.  No chest pain during this
admission.  Enzymes were not cycled.  Patient is already on
aspirin, metoprolol, lisinopril.  An echocardiogram on [**9-13**]
showed an EF of 60-65%, mild MR, mild TR, borderline PA
systolic hypertension, moderate left hypertrophy.

4. Anemia:  Patient's hematocrit was 35.7 and remained above
the goal of 30 throughout this admission.

5. Chronic renal insufficiency:  Patient's creatinine was 1.8
on admission and is baseline.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Patient was normotensive.  Patient was
tolerating p.o. with resolution of nausea and vomiting.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  Patient had a follow-up plan with his
