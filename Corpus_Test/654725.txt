 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   88 y/o F with PMHx of CAD, DM, Atrial Fib, Alzheimers, CVA in [**5-7**] on
   coumadin who was found unresponsive and bradycardic, INR of 10 and
   active upper/lower GI bleeds who was transferred from [**Hospital 2384**]
   hospital intubated and on pressors, EGD showed reflux esophagitis.
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt s/p CVA found down bradycardic and
   hypotensive.  Unclear if underlying event was hypotension vs aspiration
   of bloody gastric materials as bloody/brown secretions coming from
   mouth and some frank blood being suctionned from ETT. Another
   possibility is pulm hemorrhage.  Of note, pt was recently admitted with
   Aspiration PNA treated with Ertapenem.  Sputum culture positive for
   MRSA.
   - empiric Vanc/Zosyn for hosp organisms Asp PNA (day 5)- holding vanco
   dose as supratherapeutic today
   - continue to meet with family q24 re goals of care
   -Was overbreathing the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] switched to pressure support. Will
   recheck ABG
   - acidosis is largely secondary to metabolic acidosis from renal
   failure/lactic acidosis; administered bicarbonate yesterday (is on
   bicarb at home)
   -sputum cx showed gram positive cocci; pt also positive for MRSA.
   Covering with vanc/zosyn (still want gram negative coverage for now b/c
   ? aspiration, but d/c
ed cipro)
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt is hypotensive, likely secondary to sepsis versus
   cardiogenic shock .  Elevated lactate in setting of hypotension, now
   resolving.
   -CE trending down.
   -Liver enzymes trending down
   - No evidence of gut ischemia on CT abd/pelvis
   - still on vasopressin; levophed and dopamine weaned off; will try to
   wean vasopressin more aggressively
   - bolus NS IVF for MAP>65, but only minimally; will rely mostly on
   pressors
   # Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: Pt with baseline creatinine in the
   1.2-1.5 range, currently 3.6. Likely [**12-31**] ATN. Pt does appear to also
   have a component of CRI.
   - monitor UOP (no significant improvements), Cr trending up,
   electrolytes stable; continues to be positive each day with anasarca
   - renally dose all meds
   - renal us unremarkable
   -will formally consult renal, but likely not a good candidate for HD
   .
   # GI bleed/elevated INR: Pt with known diverticulosis and internal
   hemorrhoids who presented after being found down with blood around her
   mouth, INR of 10 and BRBPR now s/p 4units FFP with ongoing hypotension.
   Hct 24 (three point drop from yesterday). EGD with no active source of
   bleeding.
   - not actively bleeding, does have guaiac pos stool
   - maintain active type and screen
   - will not transfuse now in the setting of volume overload. Would
   maintain transfusion threshold of Hct <21
   .
   # CAD/Elevated Troponin: EKGs appear at baseline, troponin leak likely
   due to strain in setting hypotension, bradycardia and GI bleed.
   - No need to continue cycling CE, as they have trended down. Add on
   labs yesterday did not suggest any new ischemia in AM. pt appears to
   have had an NSTEMI/Demand ischemia
   - holding ASA & Coumadin due to GI bleed
   - holding BB & Statin due to GI bleed
   .
   #Elevated LFT's- likely [**12-31**] ischemia
   - will trend for resolution and maintain MAPs>65
   # Elevated Anion Gap: Likely due to acute renal failure and lactic
   acidosis, AG is 17 this AM, with downward trending lactate.
   - empiric antiobiotics
   - sodium bicarb administration to maintain pH above 7.3-7.35 so as to
   maintain environment in which pressors are active
   .
   # Afib s/p CVA: Pt with active GI bleed complicated by elevated INR
   - holding coumadin, check INR today; last INR was 1.4
   - hold aspirin
   - hold BB, hypotensive, req pressors
   .
   #Skin sloughing: f/u wound care recs
   .
   # Edema: Anasarca of likely due to poor nutrition status but also
   losing protein in urine.
   - on tube feeds; nutrition following
   -consider ACEi if possible
   -limit boluses
   .
   # FEN: NPO with bolus IVF prn
   - replete electrolytes aggressively
   -on TF

   # Code: Confirmed FULL with family, plan to reassess daily based on
