History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 82 y.o. woman w/ pmh of HTN, Afib, presenting
with lightheadedness in setting of likely beta blocker or
calcium blocker overdose. On admission, she was taking
Metoprolol Tartrate 150mg PO twice daily, in addition to
Diltiazem Ext. Release 240mg PO daily, and Nifedipine Sust.
Release 30mg PO daily. She lives at home alone, and is
self-reliant in terms of administration of her medications. She
reportedly was feeling dizzy and tired at home and called EMS.
Upon arrival, EMS found her HR was 20-30, SBP in 70's. EKG
showed afib at a rate of [**Street Address(2) 19758**] or T wave
changes. She was given atropine 0.5mg and fluids. On
presentation to the ED initial vitals were SBP 80's, HR 40's.
She was given atropine 1mg X2, HR increased to 60's. Given Ca
Gluconate 2g, Glucagon 9mg, Regular Insulin 70 units IV X1
followed by insulin drip at 70 units/hr. HR increased but
remained hypotensive. Bolused 1.5L of NS, started on dopamine
drip. SBP increased to 110, however became hypoxic with oxygen
saturation of 84% on 4L and was intubated and transferred to the
ICU.
.
Of Note, the patient has a history of two recent
hospitalizations. The first, [**Date range (1) 19755**] was secondary to
community acquired pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. She was
treated with Levaquin. She was also noted diagnosed with atrial
fibrillation during this admission, and started on coumadin,
diltiazem, and had her atenolol switched to metoprolol.
.
Her second admission occurred [**Date range (1) 19759**]. She presented with
bradycardia, diaphoresis, nausea, and reported taking a double
dose of her diltiazem. She was also in ARF w/ Cr. 2.1, lactic
acidosis with Lactate 10.0, presented with leukocytosis 16->32,
and Corynebacterium diphtheriae bacteremia, 4/4 bottles. She
completed a 14 day course of vancomycin ending [**11-19**]. Echo during
this admission was negative for vegetations.
.
Patient was intubated and unable to provide review of symptoms.
Per family and report form ED, patient was following commands
and able to communicate.

.
EKG ([**2724-12-21**]): rate 103, atrial fibrillation w/ rapid
ventricular response.  poor R wave progression, probably a
normal variant.  Compared to tracing #1, atrial fibrillation has
replaced sinus rhythm.
.
2D-Echocardiogram ([**2724-11-11**]): "The left atrium is moderately
dilated.  The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5mmHg.  There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.  The left
ventricular cavity size is normal.  Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF > 55%).  Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal.  The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.  There is no aortic valve
stenosis.  Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.  The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened.  Mild to moderate ([**12-19**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.  [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.  There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  There is no
pericardial effusion.  No vegetation seen (cannot definitively
exclude)."
.
RADIOLOGY:
CXR AP ([**12-14**])
IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube in place, 2.5 cm above the carina.
2. Mild pulmonary edema, with small bilateral pleural effusions.

3. Right infrahilar opacity, most probably represents
atelectasis, but is
incompletely assessed. Recommend further evaluation with repeat
radiography following appropriate treatment.

Brief Hospital Course:
82F w/ pmh HTN, afib, p/w bradycardia and hypotension in setting
of likely beta blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose,
complicated by PNA, UTI and C.difficile infections.
.
# Hypotension and Bradycardia: Likely BB or CCB toxicity.
Patient has history of similar presentation after overdose of
diltiazem. On admission, EKG showed afib with slow rhythm, no
heart block, no signs of ischemia. HR improved with atropine.
The patient was treated for BB or CCB overdose with calcium
gluconate, glucagon, and Insulin IV. HR continued to improve but
still remained hypotensive. Blood pressure eventually improved
with dopamine. Transitioned to levophed, then weaned.
.
# Hypoxia: Likely secondary to acute pulmonary edema. Possibly
from fluid overload in setting of diminished contractility from
BB toxicity, or may be from acute diastolic dysfunction from
myocardial ischemia given ST depressions in lateral leads.
Intubated in CCU. Hypoxia improved with diuresis, once
hypotension resolved. Pt extubated on [**12-19**]. Post extubation, pt
became agitated. Haldol, ativan and zyprexa have been tried.
Redirection, zyprexa have been used successfully.  Since
arriving on medical floor, sat 98% on 2L O2 initially and, after
one day, with desats to low 90s% on room air.  Patient continued
to be monitored for decompensation from existing COPD and
asthma, and received fluticasone propionate 110 mcg 2 puff IH
[**Hospital1 **], ipratropium bromide neb IH q6H and Xopenex 0.63 mg/3 mL
throughout her course on the medical floor.  In addition,
patient was started on Lasix due to the onset of LE edema and a
possible component of congestion from heart due to valvular
disease.
.
# CORONARIES: No history of CAD. Precordial ST depressions
present on ekg upon admission to CCU. Likely subendocardial
ischemia in setting of hypotension and low systemic diastolic
pressures. CEs were negative.
.
# PUMP: Recent echo on [**11-11**] with normal LV and RV function,
without wall motion abnormalities, LVEF 55%. Previously
hypotensive in setting of bradycardia from likely BB or CCB
toxicity. Became fluid overloaded/hypervolumic, for which
diuresis was started with the net goal of -1-2L, which was
achieved w/ lasix.
.
# RHYTHM: History of atrial fibrillation on coumadin,
metoprolol, nifedipine and diltiazem. Cardioverted on [**12-16**],
sinus rhythm for 12 hours, then reverted back to afib. Began
amiodarone [**12-17**], while still on infusion after loading dose.
INR therapeutic since [**2724-11-24**]. Home dose of Coumadin was 5mg.
Coumadin restarted at 4mg, in setting of amiodarone and abx.
Amiodarone switched to 400mg PO BID and on diltiazem 30mg PO QID
as sole drugs for atrial fibrillation. Cardioversion on [**12-20**],
which reverted back to atrial fibrillation on [**12-21**], evidenced by
EKG on that date.  Coumadin held [**Date range (1) 19760**] due to
supratherapeutic INR (>3).  Coumadin restarted on [**12-24**] at dose
of 2mg.  5mg is pt's normal dose.  Lower dose given due to
multiple antibiotics (less K+ production) and amiodarone
therapy.  Continue to monitor INR and up titrate as needed as
antibiotic courses are finished.  Pt started on diltiazem to
90mg PO QID and metoprolol 37.5mg TID.  Pt may benefit from
cardioversion attempt after amiodarone is fully loaded.  If pt
becomes tachycardic, may up titrate metoprolol to 150mg total
per day.  Pt has appt w/ cardiology on [**1-1**].  Will likely bring
amiodarone down from loading dose at that time.

.
# Acute Renal Failure/anuria: Likely prerenal in setting of
bradycardia and hypotension. Pressure increased on pressors.
Producing scant urine on presentaiton to CCU. Mucus membranes
dry, may be from hypovolemia vs. anticholinergic effects of
atropine. Resolved w/ fluids and pressors.
.
#ID: Multiple sources of infection:
a.) Community acquired PNA w/ pansensitive Klebsiella -->
finished ceftriaxone 7-day course (last day [**12-22**]) and
azithromycin 5-day course (last day [**12-20**]).
b.) UA on admission growing VRE, sensitive to linezolid -->
finished 7-day course, last doze of linezolid on [**12-23**]. Completed.

c.) Positive for C.Diff, started on PO vanc and flagyl (day 1 on
[**12-18**]). legionella urinary antigen negative. Diarrhea resolved.
PO vanc d/c'd on [**12-23**].  14 day course of PO flagyl will be
completed on [**1-1**].
.
# Transaminitis: ALT 154, AST 234, new during this admission.
Possibly from hepatic toxicity as metoprolol, diltiazem, and
nifedipine are metabolized by liver. [**Month (only) 10**] also be due to hepatic
ischemia from hypotension. Resolved.
.
# Acid-Base: Non-Ag metabolic acidosis likely from diahrrea and
increased saline administration. Resolved.
.
# Anemia: iron deficiency anemia. Stool guaiac negative. On
iron.  Hct stable and return to [**10-25**] b/l (~27).
.
# Hyperlipidemia: lipitor was held for transaminitis, now
restarted at usual dose.

Moving Forward:
a.) pt should continue metronidazole for c. diff until [**1-1**],
which will complete her 14 day course
b.) Pt's INR subtherapeutic on warfarin dose of 2mg.  Increased
dose to 3mg/day on discharge.  Usual home dose prior to
admission was 5mg. Lower dose given due to multiple antibiotics
(less K+ production) and amiodarone therapy.  INR should
continue to be  monitored and warfarin may need to be
up-titrated as pt comes off of antibiotics.
c.) Pt was started on amiodarone on [**12-17**] on loading dose of 400
mg [**Hospital1 **].  Pt has cardiology appt on [**1-1**] and will likely be
decreased to maintenance dose at that time.
d.) If pt becomes sustained tachycardic, consider up-titrating
metoprolol.
