TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: respiratory failure, necrotizing myopathy, wound
   infection, seizures
   24 Hour Events:
   - Neuro: load with 1.8g (20mg/kg) Keppra IV, then start keppra 1000mg
   tonight for maintenance. Ativan prn szr activity. - Consider LP and MRI
   to look for source of seizures. Then loaded IV fosphenytoin for
   seizures. Pt became hypotensive (to 50s) during loading, so loading had
   to be dc'ed.
   - Family meeting: be sure to discuss any changes to patient's
   management with his wife (including medication changes) as she is very
   concerned that medication sensitivity is what led to his current
   situation.
   - In the evening, pt de-sat'ed to high 80s, came up to >95% with 50%
   FiO2 (increased from 40%). Got a CXR (c/w fluid overload, relatively
   unchanged from prior), and gave lasix 20mg IV x1, as patient was
   positive for the day.
   - Attempted to place A-line, unsuccessfully.
   - Unable to do MRI [**1-27**] EEG electrodes on pt's head--will need to be
   removed by EEG tech today.
   - Started Acyclovir as empiric HSV encephalitis coverage.
   - Plan for LP this AM. Pt is receiving 2U FFP to reverse INR.

   Imaging: [**12-15**] CXR mild fluid overload, overall improved from prior
   days
   [**12-15**] CXR As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
   change. The endotracheal tube is in unchanged position. Also unchanged
   are the right-sided Port-A-Cath and the nasogastric tube. The
   appearance of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Complete left lower
   lobe atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions. Mild interstitial
   fluid accumulation potentially
   suggesting edema. No newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities
   suggesting
   pneumonia.
   Microbiology: None new
   Assessment and Plan
   65M admitted [**11-26**] for R LE BKA, with course c/b afib with RVR s/p
   DCCVx1, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, on [**12-5**]
   prompting intubation and transient pressor support.  Pt was extubated
   on 12/, but then had to be re-intubated on [**12-9**] due to recurrent
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # hypercarbic respiratory failure - details of decompensation unclear.
   pt has a chronic metabolic alkalosis on admission (no known COPD, OSA,
   ? [**1-27**] respiratory acidosis [**1-27**] statin induced myopathy or MG).  ABG
   during initial event consistent with hypoventilation (contributors
   include his myopathy, and medications, though unclear if he received
   dilaudid or ultram prior to intubation).  at present, he continues to
   have some degree of hypoventilation despite 15cm of pressure support.
   otherwise, his CXR and exam are consistent with volume overload, no
   frank evidence of pneumonia.  feel PE is less likely given therapeutic
   INR and on heparin gtt.  no evidence of aspiration per wife and pt is
   handing his secretions effectively.  Currently most likely is. statin
   induced myopathy.  Extubated on [**12-7**]. But had to be re-intubated [**12-10**]
   for recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   - close monitoring of volume status, holding diuresis for now given low
   BPs
   - PCO2 goal 50 to help retain bicarb
   - s/p 5 day course of IVIG (last day [**12-15**])
   - avoid sedating medications
   - Continue Cellcept (changed to IV) and home prednisone, although
   monitoring WBC (if less than 2.5, will need to decrease dose of
   cellcept by
   - f/u Neurology recs
   - given pt
s altered mental status and overall worse clinical status,
   will not extubate today; continue weaning FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated
   .
   # Myoclonic Jerks:  Given 2mg Ativan initially per Neuro recs for
   myoclonic jerks, with rapid resolution of symptoms (although pt very
   somnolent for 1 day after).  Repeat 24 hour EEG showed runs of rhythmic
   activity suggestive of non-convulsive seizures, increasingly organizing
   throughout the day.  Neurology recommended initiating Keppra [**12-15**] with
   maintenance [**Hospital1 **] dose, and is continuing 24 hour EEG monitoring to see
   if medications are adequately controlling the pt
s seizures.
   - s/p IV loading with 20 mg/kg of Keppra; 1800mg loading dose
   - Maintenance dose of Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - f/u final results of 24 hour EEG
   - f/u Neuro recs re: further workup of seizures
   .
   # Elevated PTT:  Uncertain why PTT increased from 50
s to 150
s over
   the last 24 hours without any apparent cause.
   - PM PTT today
   - Consider a-line in case portacath is causing mis-read of PTT
   .
   # hypotension/relative hypothermia - normotensive presently, off
   pressors since early this morning.   no frank evidence of sepsis
   presently (lactate 0.7, leukocytosis improving without antibiotics,
   LFTs wnl).  cardiology does not feel that hypotension is [**1-27**] decreased
   EF.  ECG without STE.  ddx also includes hypovolemia, though grossly
   anasaric, his HCT has trended down to 24, but responded to 2U PRBC
   today.  R LE shows erythema/warmth c/w cellulitis and has purulent
   drainage from site.  Swab from wound grew Pseudomononas resistant to
   zosyn, sensitive to cefepime, meropenem, ceftaz.  Currently on
   Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **].
   - Hypotension yesterday could be due to over-diuresis, IVIG reaction or
   sepsis.  Pt without fevers, cultures from [**12-10**] pending, will follow.
   Less likely is occult bleeding, although pt
s HCT has been trending
   down over last 5 days, his baseline is 25-30 over last year, so pt is
   at baseline. ? hemoconcentration earlier in week w. HCT 40.  Pt was
   pre-treated prior to IVIG but will closely monitor pt before today
   treatment.  Most likely etiology at this time is over-diuresis.
   - On home prednisone 5mg daily.
   - Continuing home Cellcept
   - IVIG today (day [**4-29**])
   - Continue levothyroxine based upon TSH, T4

   ddx also include bicarbonate loss [**1-27**] diarrhea, though not significant
   presently, and volume resuscitation given elevated chloride, though

   # anemia, chronic disease -  per wife, receives chronic blood

   # leukocytosis - no clear evidence of infection presently, resolving
   without antibiotics.  did have fever 101.8 post-op on [**12-2**], though
   unclear if he has had recurrence.  R LE shows erythema c/w cellulitis
   and has purulent drainage from site.  Swab from wound grew
