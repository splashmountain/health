Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint: Direct admit from home for treatment of
endocarditis, vegetation on RV lead of AICD


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Removal of infected pacemaker leads via [**Doctor First Name **]-sternotomy
PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
44 yo M with RV dysplasia, s/p AICD who is admitted for
treatment of right sided endocarditis a/w with his AICD wire.
Patient initially started having fevers, chills, malaise,
anorexia and nausea in [**1-6**] initially thought to be a PNA and
rxed with Avelox by his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] did not have chest pain or sob
at that time. No blood cultures were drawn. In mid [**3090-2-2**]
his symptoms recurred and he had one episode of syncope while
chopping wood in his yard. His AICD fired at that time. His
device was interrogated and he was sent home without further
intervention. He returned to his PCP with ongoing symptoms and
was again treated with 6-7 days of antibiotics (same [**Doctor Last Name 539**]) and
again felt better with treatment. A CXR was performed and was
c/w PNA. CT of the chest was also performed and showed multiple
peripheral lung opacities. He was then referred to a
Pulmonologist who diagnosed him with emphyseam and OSA. The
patient did not agree with this diagnosis and sought a second
opinion. Another CT was done and showed similar findings. A
second pulmonologist diagnosed him with the flu. In [**5-/3090**], he
had another episode of fevers/chills, loss of appetite and
malaise and was put on 21 days of antibiotic therapy with
Augmentin. Again, no cultures were drawn. In [**6-7**] patient felt
better with improved appetite and energy levels since he showed
a response to antibiotics each time.
.
He then again had recurrence of anorexia and malaise with low
grade fevers in [**7-8**] and was admitted to [**Hospital1 52**] under Dr.
[**Name (NI) 2971**]. CT Scan of the chest that revealed multifocal
opacities of varying morphologies, including patchy areas of
gound-glass opacity and nodules up to 6 mm in diameter in in
multiple lobes. There was symetric mediastinal lymphadenopathy
with nodes up to 12 mm in the pretracheal area, and borderline
left and right hilar adenopathy. There were ICD leads in the
right atrial and ventricular
contacts. Bronchoscopy and [**Name2 (NI) **] with endobronchial and
transbronchial biopsis were done on [**3090-8-19**] showing negative
stains and cultures for bacteria, fungi and acid-fast organisms.

.
He had another chest CT scan on [**3090-9-10**] that was compared with a
prior study of [**7-8**]. This revealed multiple new, predominantly
peripheral irregular nodular opacities in both lungs, and a new
area of gound-glass opacity peripherally in the superior segment
of the RLL. Previously seen nodules in the LUL, RUL and RLL were
either unchanged or decreased in size. There was symmetric
mediastinal lymphadenopathy with nodes up to 12 mm in the
pretracheal region, and left hilar and right hilar borderline
adenopathy that was stable compared to the CT scan of [**7-8**]. He
was admitted to the [**Hospital1 52**] from [**9-29**] -> [**3090-9-30**] for VATS to take
biopsies. This revealed acute and organizing thromboemboli with
focal infarctionand extensive reactive changes including
organizing pneumonitis. TEE was then done on [**10-20**] to r/out
endocarditis. This showed a 3 cm mobile, irregular echogenic
mass with multiple smaller components attached to the right
venticular wire at the level of the right atrium. The left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and systolic function
were normal with EF > 55% and 1+ MR. With these results he was
referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8373**] in ID and finally drew blood cultures
for bacterial, fungal, AFB and bartonella isolators. His blood
cx came positive for [**3-6**] GPC in clusters and he was contact[**Name (NI) **] to
come to the hospital for IV antibiotic treatment and possible
lead removal.
.
ROS: last fever and chills ~ 1 week ago, denies HA, had two
episodes of visual blurring b/l, resolved spontaneously, no
N/V/D, no dysuria, no change in urine output.

Past Medical History:
- RV dysplasia dx at age 16, presenting with two episodes of
exertional syncope. He has been on chronic treatment with
Quinidine
- Paroxysmal VT requiring placement of an AICD in [**3082**] done at
[**Hospital1 **].
- AICD was changed from the left to the right side of chest in
[**3086**] due to lead fracture (done at OSH)
- AICD fires ~ 1x per year, usually associated with strenuous
activity,  usually chopping wood, usually has lightheadeness and
presyncope, occasional frank syncope.
- recurrent pulmonary infections as a child and young adult
- multiple pulmonary nodules s/p right VATS and lung biopsy
[**3090-9-29**] c/w acute and chronic organizing thromboemboli with
focal infarction and extensive reactive changes including
organizing pneumonitis.
- vegetation on his AICD leads was seen on TTE [**10-17**] and TEE on
[**10-20**].


Social History:
Works as a real estate [**Doctor Last Name 539**]. He is married with 2 children from
a previous marriage, they have several pets including a dog and
cats. Of note he hunts deer and wild [**Country 7174**], and guts his own
game. He last did this when he was feeling well in [**6-7**] when he
hunted [**Country **].


Family History:
The Family Medical History is notable for his mother who is 72
and is in good health. His father died of esophageal cancer at
the age of 58. He has four siblings, who are alive and in good
health. No history of cardiac disorders in the family.

CTA chest/abd/pelvis [**10-23**]:
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a new dual-lead pacer
that has been placed since the prior study, and the prior one
removed. An additional abandoned pacer wire overlying the left
shoulder is unchanged. There are multiple small mediastinal
lymph nodes, which did not meet CT criteria for pathological
enlargement, but are mildly prominent and likely reactive. There
is no axillary lymphadenopathy. There are mildly prominent
bilateral hilar lymph nodes, particularly on the left, an
unchanged appearance. The heart, great vessels, and pericardium
are unremarkable. There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
There are small bilateral effusions, greater on the right than
left. There is evidence of recent VATS wedge resection
surgeries. A number of the previously demonstrated abnormal
bilateral opacities are considerably improved since the prior
study, perhaps due to prior treatment in some areas and
resection in others.
However, there are also entirely new multiple bilateral small
cavitating lung nodules. These include a spiculated cavitary
nodule of 11 mm in the right middle lobe and a smaller 7 mm
cavitating nodule. There is a new spiculated 7-mm nodule in the
left upper lobe. A more confluent opacity in the left upper lobe
has mostly resolved, but more posteriorly, within the apical
segment of the left lower lobe, there is a new cavitary nodule
of 12 mm in diameter.
There is opacity at the left lung base which is suggestive of
atelectasis. Similarly, there is atelectasis and scarring at the
right lung base where a prior wedge resection has apparently
been performed. There is no pericardial effusion.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, gallbladder,
spleen, and pancreas are within normal limits. The stomach,
small and large bowel are unremarkable. There is a horseshoe
kidney in the upper pelvis which is otherwise unremarkable. The
adrenal glands are not well visualized. There are numerous small
retroperitoneal lymph nodes, not meeting CT criteria for
pathological enlargement, but which are slightly prominent.
These may be reactive. There is no free air or fluid.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The prostate, seminal
vesicles, distal ureters, bladder, sigmoid, and rectum are
unremarkable. There is no lymphadenopathy, or free fluid. There
is no evidence of abscess.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
IMPRESSION:
1. Replacement of right-sided ICD device since earlier CT,
although an abandoned pacer wire extending from the left is
unchanged.
2. Status post VATS surgeries. Many previously identified
opacities have considerably improved, including several which do
not appear to have been resected surgically.
3. Multiple new bilateral cavitating nodules with spiculation,
up to 12 mm in diameter. Given the clinical setting, these are
most suspicious for septic emboli.
4. No evidence of abdominal abscess.
5. Horseshoe kidney.

Cardiac cath [**10-24**]:
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary artery of this right dominant system
demonstrated
no angiographically apparant coronary artery disease in the
LMCA, LAD,
LCx, RCA and their branches.
2.  Left ventriculography was not performed since the patient
has had a
recent assessment of his left ventricular function.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.

Intra-op TEE [**10-24**]:
LEFT ATRIUM: No mass/thrombus in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. A mass/thrombus
associated with a catheter/pacing wire in the RA or RV.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild global LV hypokinesis. Mildly depressed
LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.
AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no
atherosclerotic plaque.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. No TEE related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results
Conclusions:
1. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage.
2. A mass/thrombus associated with a pacing wire is seen in the
right atrium and/or right ventricle.
3.There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
4.There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.

5.The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in
diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.
6. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
8. The RV lead with the thrombus on it has been removed.
Tricuspid valve is intact and there is no evidence of tamponade.


CTA [**11-3**]:
CT OF THE THORAX WITH IV CONTRAST: Scattered axillary lymph
nodes are identified, none of which appear to be pathologically
enlarged by CT criteria. Hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes are
again seen and appear stable compared to the previous study.
Within the hila bilaterally, the lymph nodes measure up to 9 mm
in short axis diameter, which is relatively stable compared to
the [**Name (NI) **] study. The heart and pericardium are unremarkable.
A filling defect is seen within one of the segmental arteries
supplying the right lower lobe which was not seen on the
[**10-23**] study. This finding is consistent with an acute
pulmonary embolism.
Bilateral pleural effusions are again seen, with possible slight
improvement in the size of the right pleural effusion. The left
pleural effusion appears stable.
The left side pacing lead is identified with its tip in the left
subclavian vein. The lead tip is located at the approximate
junction of the axillary and subclavian vein in the region of
the left first rib. The left subclavian itself is noted to be
thrombosed and calcified with multiple left-sided collateral
vessels identified in the soft tissues and musculature.
Lung windows again reveal evidence of VATS wedge resection
surgeries. Many of the previously identified bilateral opacities
are stable compared to the study from late [**Month (only) **]. The
previously identified cavitary lesions do appear smaller on
today's study. For example, a cavitary lesion seen within the
right lower lobe measuring 11 mm is again identified in series
4, image 66 and measures approximately 6 mm. No cavitation
within this lesion is identified. The 12-mm cavitary nodule
within the apical portion of the left lower lobe measures 10 mm
on today's study and the cavity within is less distinct. A
potentially new opacity at the left lung apex is identified
measuring approximately 16 mm. The airways are patent to the
level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally.
Images through the upper portion of the abdomen reveal no
abnormalities of the visualized portions of the liver, or
spleen.
Osseous structures reveal no worrisome lytic or sclerotic
lesions.
Coronal and sagittal reformations support the above findings.
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute pulmonary embolism of a segmental branch of the right
lower lobe pulmonary artery. This finding is new compared to
[**3090-10-23**].
2. Presence of left sided pacer lead with tip in the left
subclavian vein as detailed above. Thrombosis and calcification
of the left subclavian vein with numerous soft tissue
collaterals on the left are identified.
3. Stability of many previously identified opacities within the
lung parenchyma. Previously identified cavitary lesions have
decreased in size in the interval between the previous study and
today's study. Question of a new opacity at the left lung apex.
4. Stable axillary, mediastinal, and bilateral hilar adenopathy
measuring up to 9 mm in short axis diameter.

CT T-spine [**11-5**]:
FINDINGS: There is mild anterior compression deformity of the T4
vertebral body which is unchanged compared to the recent CT of
the chest dated [**3090-10-23**] and likely unchanged compared
to the scout of the CT scan performed on [**3090-8-1**]. No other
bony abnormalities are detected. The remaining vertebral body
heights, disc spaces, and alignment are preserved. The limited
visualized portions of the spinal canal are unremarkable with no
evidence for abscess. However, note that CT has very low
sensitivity for intraspinal abscess, and most abscesses will be
missed on CT. If there is a clinical concern for epidural
abscess, then an MR is far more sensitive.
Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, are again
present consistent with the recent CT scan of the chest. For
additional details of the chest findings, please refer to that
study. Incidental note is made of opacification of multiple
lumbar collateral veins. Incidental note is also made of a
Schmorl's node involving the superior endplate of the L1
vertebral body which is also seen on prior studies.
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild anterior compression deformity of the T4 vertebral body
which is unchanged compared to [**3090-10-23**] and likely
unchanged compared to the scout of more remote prior.
2. No definite evidence of abscess. However, CT is so limited
for detecting intraspinal abscesses that a negative study is of
little significance. If there is clinical concern for this
entity, then MRI would be recommended for better evaluation.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Endocarditis/Thrombus:  As in HPI, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 24932**] presented with
septic emboli which were found to be due to an infected thrombus
on his pacemaker lead.  It was unclear how he became bacteremic,
but he did have a leg injury a year prior to discharge when he
cut hismelf with a chainsaw.  His blood cultures from his [**10-20**]
ID clinic visit grew coag-negative staph.  His blood cultures
cleared on nafcillin.  He was also treated with gentamicin while
in the hospital per ID recommendations.  In terms of the
thrombus portion, he was treated with lovenox (see below for
hypercoag issues).  His pacemaker and endocardial leads were
removed percutaneously by CT surgery on [**10-30**], but they were
unable to remove his RA lead completely due to a thrombosed
innominate vein occlusion.  Vascular surgery was consulted in
the OR by CT surgery, and they recommended removal via an open
procedure.  On [**11-5**], he had an upper median sternotomy with
removal of his last pacemaker lead.  He recovered from both of
these procedures well.  Of note, he had a CTA on [**11-3**] for
vascular planning prior to his surgery.  This incidentally found
a PE (see below).  He was not symptomatic from this, but had
been having baseline pleuritic chest pain felt to be due to his
numerous septic emboli.  He initially was found to have positive
brucella titers as well, and was treated with doxycycline.  The
titers were repeated and were negative, and the doxy was stopped
per ID as it was felt to be unlikely that he had both an
infected thrombus and brucellosis.  Prior to discharge, a PICC
line was placed and he will receive nafcillin through that.  He
will follow up with ID, who will decide on his course of
antibiotics (at least 6 weeks).  Once his course of antibiotics
is finished, the ID fellow will contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and the
pt will have his pacemaker replaced.

2. PE: Found incidentally on CTA done to evaluate vein prior to
OR, but pt had been having symptoms of pleuritic chest pain and
SOB.  He was already being anticoagulated for his infected
thrombus at the time of the CTA, so it did not change management
in that sense.  He was continued on lovenox upon discharge.  He
had a hypercoaguable workup done, and his lupus anticoagulant
and anticardiolipin antibodies were all positive, so he needs to
be on lifelong anticoagulation.  His factor V leiden and
prothrombin mutation were both negative.  He was set up with a
Hematology appointment upon discharge.  A long discussion was
held with the pt about the need for lifelong anticoagulation,
and he preferred to be on lovenox as opposed to coumadin as he
did not want to have to get frequent INR checks.

3. Back pain:  He developed back pain during his last few days
of hospitalization.  It had started to improve by the day of
discharge, and it was felt to be due to musculoskeletal pain
from being in bed for 2 weeks.  However, given his
hypercoaguable state and known clot with numerous emboli, a CT
of his T spine was done.  It was negative.  (We discussed this
with Radiology, as an MRI would be better to look for epidural
abscess but he could not have an MRI as he required constant
telemetry monitoring due to his ARVD and he would need to be off
tele for the MRI, so Radiology felt that a CT scan would be
adequate given the low clinical likelihood.)

4. ARVD: He was continued on his outpatient regimen of atenolol
and quinidine.  He had a Lifevest placed prior to discharge.  He
will have his pacemaker replaced once he has completed his
course of antibiotics, which will be decided by ID and will be
discussed with his Electrophysiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

5. Diarrhea:  He had diarrhea while in the hospital.  C diff was
negative x3, and a toxin B was also negative.  It was felt to be
related to his antibiotics.
