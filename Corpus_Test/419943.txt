   CT neck (wet read):
   Assymmetric soft tissue left oropharyngeal mucosal and submucosal
   region (extending to the level of C7) from the location of left
   palatine tonsil extending laterally to the parapharyngeal space and
   mildly displacing the left carotid artery laterally and into the
   retropharyngeal space and crossing midline to the right parapharyngeal
   space . with surrounding fat stranding extending to the left lateral
   neck soft tissues. multiple adjacent prominant
   lymph nodes. No drainable abcess seen at this time, however mild
   peripheral enhancement may represent developing abcess.
   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old female with PMH of HIV (CD4 448 [**7-10**]) who presents with L
   sided neck swelling.
   # L sided neck mass: CT neck showed supraglottitis/pharyngitis. ENT
   following, and ID service will begin following tomorrow AM.  On
   clindamycin, decadron and unasyn per their recs.  Patient is currently
   sating 100% on RA without increased work of breathing.  She is actively
   suctioning her saliva but airway is fine.
   -closely monitor RR and exam for development of stridor
   -continue clinda, decadron (only 3 doses) and unasyn
   -racemic epinephrine nebs (along with preparation for possible
   intubation and possible surgical airway) if any stridor or true
   respiratory distress develops
   .
   # HIV: Most recent CD4 448.  Inpatient ID will begin following in AM.
   ID wanted HIV genotype but will be difficult to obtain while inpt.
   -continue Truvada and Kaletra
   .
   # Bipolar disorder/depression: She is being seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
   behavioral neurology.  Continue home bupropion, lamotrigine, setraline
   and lorazepam.
   -continue bupropion, lamotrigine, setraline and lorazepam
   .
   # Chronic back pain: Holding her home lido patch and
   tramadol as she is receiving IV morphine PRN pain.  Giving home lyrica.
   .
   # Iatrogenic [**Location (un) 5873**]/Adrenal Insufficiency: Had secondary adrenal
   insuffiency back in [**Month (only) 11**] after an injection of steroids for shoulder
   pain thought to be due to an interaction between her HAART and
   steroids.  She does not take steroids at home.  Currently on decadron
   for a total of 3 doses.
   - consider endocrine consult if signs of insuffiency after decadron d/c
   .
   # Gastric ulcer: Continuing home ranitidine.
   -holding loratadine as non-formulary
   .
   # FEN: maintenance IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO (except meds) for now
