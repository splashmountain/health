   Maybe some improvement on left in CXR from today ([**10-18**])
   CXR: [**10-17**]
   In comparison with study of [**10-16**], there is little change. Diffuse
   interstitial changes are again seen with a more coalescent region in
   the
   lateral aspect of the right base. The wedge-shaped opacity could
   represent
   aspiration, infection, or even possibly an area of pulmonary infarct.
   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o man with known COPD, interstitial lung disease, asbestos
   exposure, and prior NSCLC s/p radiation therapy admitted with
   respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   # Respiratory distress: The patient has underlying interstitial lung
   disease with baseline oxygen requirement and is s/p NSCLC though
   clearly he is much worse than baseline.  With the BAL gram stain that
   is positive for gram+ cocci in pairs, this could be infection with S.
   pneumonia, superimposed on chronic lung disease.  The CT scan is more
   consistent with alveolar hemorrhage, casting some doubt on the
   diagnosis of S. pneumonia, although we might expect this patient to
   have a somewhat atypical presentation given the severity of his
   underlying lung disease.  Differential diagnosis includes (1) other
   infections: bacterial, Pneumocystis (although DFI negative), viral,
   fungal, and Mycobacteria (unlikely, but will consider in Ddx until
   results of [**Date Range 669**] fast smear are available), (2) vasculitis (no RBC casts
   on U/A, C3 and C4 levels normal, other studies pending), (3)
   hypersensitivity pneumonitis, (4) neoplasm (cytology pending), and (5)
   worsening of patient
s underlying lung disease.  Eosinophilic pneumonia
   excluded by lack of eosinophils on BAL differential.  Cardiac etiology
   unlikely given non-postural nature of patient
s symptoms, lack of
   significant JVD, and unchanged EKG. [**Doctor First Name **] and ANCA are -.
   - BAL- only positive on gram stain for GPC in pairs, neg for virus,
   PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 669**] fast bact, legionella
   - f/u anti-GBM
   - f/u beta glucan, galactomannan
   - cover HCAP with vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin given recent
   exposure to [**Hospital 601**] clinic, hospital stay several months ago.  This
   should provide good coverage for S. pneumonia if that turns out to be
   the diagnosis.
   - continue empiric treatment for Pneumocystis with treatment dose
   Bactrim and IV steroids for DAH coverage (1 g solumedrol per day).
   - supplemental oxygen as necessary to achieve saturation > 90%
   - atrovent nebs scheduled and prn
   # Urinary retention: On arrival to the MICU, the patient had distended
   bladder evident on examination. Voided ~ 800 cc with > 500 cc postvoid
   residual.  Foley catheter placed with residual 100 cc.
   - would like to d/c foley although patient has requested it stay in for
   another day so he doesn
t have to exert as much considering a high
   urine output
   - avoid anticholinergics
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Continue to monitor creatinine closely.
   Appears at recent baseline.  No evidence of glomerulonephritis on U/A.
   - renally dose medications as appropriate
   - monitor lytes
   # Alcohol use: patient drinks 4-5 beers daily. Monitor on CIWA scale
   with valium prn (to be written by HO if necessary, no standing order).
   Thiamine, folate, MVI daily.
   - Received Ativan overnight for htn and tachy
   - Also treated tachycardia with fluids
   # Hypertension: Hold HCTZ for now and monitor BPs.
   # Ppx: Pneumoboots, IV PPI, bowel meds prn, fingersticks 4X per day and
   SSI while on steroids
   # CODE: FULL, confirmed with patient and wife. Wife is HCP.
