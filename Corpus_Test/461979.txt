TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   HPI: 56 yo F w/ ESLD and renal insufficiency now p/w diffuse bleeding,
   abd distension and hypotension. She was previously admitted to the MICU
   for encephalopathy/access difficulties and then back to [**Hospital Ward Name 763**] 10 with Q3
   lactulose. She had been relatively stable w/ SBPs in the 120 range and
   A/Ox2-3. This morning she was noted to be more confused and oozing
   blood from venous access sites, mouth and vagina. There was no blood in
   rectal tube. Her abd was noted to be more distended. KUB showed
   distention of the stomach and colon w/o air-fluid levels.
   .
   She was transferred to the MICU and NGT is placed which aspirates
   blood. She is intubated and a cordis is placed for rapid resucitation.
   She became hypotense to SBP 67. She was given 3U PRBCs, 4U FFP, 1U cryo
   and started on dopamine drip. CVP was noted to be elevated to 30s and
   heart was enlarged on CXR so stat echo was ordered and showed no
   effusion but PASP 40-48 with a normal LVEF. She had EGD by GI which
   showed diffuse oozing in the stomach which had stopped.

   Assessment and Plan
   Right arm hematoma
   56 yo F w/ ESLD, ARF, bleeding and distended abdomen p/w hypotension.
   #  Hypotension: No e/o cardiac failure, doubt PE as RV not blown out.
   Could be in part pulmonary HTN but pt. not hypoxic. Cardiac enzymes
   elevated likely [**1-21**] demand ischemia in settin of acute renal failure.
   Differential would include blood loss, sepsis and HRS. Will start broad
   spectrum Abx for abdominal source possibly bowel infarct, colitis or
   SBP. Lactate 3.2 likely argues against sepsis in a pt. w/ severe
   hepatic failure. Afebrile but hypothermic. SVO2 86 suggests adequately
   volume resuscitated.
   - Daptomycin given Hx of VRE
   - Meropenem
   - Metronidazole given distended colon  for c.diff
   - dopamine titrate to MAP>60
   - follow UOP
   - Blood cultures
   - CT abd w/ contrast
   .
   #Bleeding: Stopped for now. Nose packed, OGT draining bilious fluid w/o
   gross blood, no blood in rectal tube. INR trending down appropriately
   w/ factors. No varices seen on EGD.
   - follow fibrinogen and replete w/ cryo
   - follow INR
   - trend Hct Q6 and Tx <25
   - follow OGT output.
   .
   # ESLD: On transplant list, near top. Hepatology following, transplant
   surgery following. Cr rising quickly appears to be HRS. Has gotten
   factors and blood so will hold off on albumin for now.
   - Lactulose/rifaximin
   - needs liver transplant
   - f/u hepatology recs
   .
   #DMII:
   - SSI
   - Finger sticks
   .
   #Hx of Breast CA: Holding Femara given clinical instability.
   .
   # FEN: IVFs / replete lytes prn / regular diet
   # PPX: PPI, heparin SQ, bowel regimen
