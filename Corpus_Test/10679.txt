Service:  CT [**Doctor First Name **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old gentleman
who presented to the cardiac catheterization laboratory after
being referred for approximately three episodes of chest pain
while walking followed by a positive exercise tolerance test.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history was
significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, a positive family
history, bilateral claudication, carotid stenosis, prostatic
cancer treated with radiation therapy, glaucoma and a right
inguinal hernia repair.  The patient also stated that he had
a transient ischemic attack with one episode of loss of
speech; however, this resolved spontaneously after two
minutes with no further symptoms following this episode.

ALLERGIES:  There were no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Glucovance 1.25 mg/250 mg p.o. q.d.
Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
Xanax 0.5 mg p.o. p.r.n. for anxiety.
Pravachol 40 mg p.o. q.d.
Toprol XL 50 mg p.o. q.d.
Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Laboratory values on admission
to the hospital were unremarkable with the exception of a
blood glucose level of 259.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient's physical
examination on admission was also unremarkable with stable
vital signs.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory and underwent a cardiac
catheterization, which revealed a left ventricular ejection
fraction of 55% and a left main coronary artery occlusion of
90% as well as three vessel coronary artery disease.  He was
taken to the operating room as a result of these
catheterization findings on [**2837-8-7**], where underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting times four with a left
internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending
artery, a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal artery,
a saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery and
a saphenous vein graft to the first branch of the diagonal
artery.

Postoperatively, the patient was transported from the
operating room to the cardiac surgery recovery unit on
intravenous nitroglycerin and propofol drip.  He remained
intubated until postoperative day #1 due to slightly excess
amounts of postoperative bleeding and coagulopathy, which
were corrected over the first 12 to 18 hours.

On postoperative day #1, the patient was weaned from the
mechanical ventilator and extubated.  He was noted to be in
atrial fibrillation and was started on intravenous amiodarone
drip and Lopressor.  As he became to become more awake, the
patient was noted to be extremely confused, agitated and
occasionally combative, requiring sedation at times.
Diuresis was initiated.

On postoperative day #3, there was a concern for aspiration
due to excessive coughing noted when the patient was given
any oral medication.  The patient was evaluated by the speech
therapist, who felt that the patient was at high risk for
aspiration and a nasogastric tube was inserted to initiate
nutritional support during this time.

There was a question of an aspiration pneumonia.  Although
this was not evident by chest x-ray, the patient had a lot of
respiratory secretions with a significant cough and a bit of
an elevated white blood cell count and it was felt prudent to
place him on empiric antibiotic therapy of levofloxacin and
Flagyl to cover him for possible aspiration pneumonia.  The
only significant chest x-ray finding over the few days were
bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient remained in the cardiothoracic intensive care
unit over the next few days essentially for close monitoring,
pulmonary toilet issues and control of atrial fibrillation.
He was transferred to the telemetry floor out of the
intensive care unit on postoperative day #5.  The patient was
noted to be very agitated and combative at that time and he
was also back in rapid atrial fibrillation.  This was treated
with intravenous Lopressor.  The patient was given some
sedation as well as soft restraints for the patient's safety.

Over the next few days, the patient remained hemodynamically
stable in atrial fibrillation.  His pulmonary status was
marginal, partly due to his mental status and inability to
cooperate with pulmonary toilet efforts.  He was begun on low
dose Coumadin for anticoagulation for his atrial
fibrillation.  The patient was slow to progress over the next
few days with physical therapy.

The patient's other concern over these few days was his blood
sugar, which was very difficult to control.  The [**Hospital 124**]
Clinic was consulted and assisted with glucose control.

The patient was maintained with nasogastric tube feedings
over the time that he continued to be an aspiration risk.
The speech therapy service continued to follow the patient
regularly.  The patient went for a video swallow study on
postoperative day #7, which revealed no aspiration at that
time, simply delayed swallowing.  It was the speech
therapist's recommendation to begin an oral diet with a
pureed diet and honey-thick liquids and avoidance of thin
liquids.  This was initiated and the patient tolerated this
without problems.

On [**2837-8-18**], postoperative day #11, the patient continued to
have marginal respiratory status with intermittent episodes
of tachypnea and hypoxia.  A chest x-ray was obtained that
showed bilateral effusions, left greater than right, and a
left thoracentesis was performed.  The patient improved
clinically and his followup chest x-ray revealed no
pneumothorax and significant resolution of the pleural
effusion.

On postoperative day #13, [**2837-8-20**], the patient remained
hemodynamically stable.  He was in atrial fibrillation with a
controlled ventricular rate.  His pulmonary status was much
more stable than it had been.  He had a good, strong cough.
Another chest x-ray was obtained for surveillance purposes
and this revealed small bilateral pleural effusions without
other significant x-ray findings.  The patient's mental
status had completely cleared and he was alert and oriented
and it was felt appropriate to screen him for rehabilitation
placement at this time.  It was also noted at this time that
the patient was somewhat dehydrated by laboratory values with
a sodium of 147 and a BUN of 50 and the patient was given
more fluids at that time.

Today, [**2837-8-21**], postoperative day #14, the patient remains
hemodynamically stable.  He is stable from a pulmonary
standpoint and is ready to be discharged to a rehabilitation
facility.

VITAL SIGNS ON DISCHARGE:  The patient has a temperature of
95.5??????F, a pulse of 66 in atrial fibrillation, a respiratory
rate of 22, a blood pressure of 130/60 and a room air oxygen
saturation of 95%.

LABORATORY DATA ON DISCHARGE:  The most recent laboratory
values today are as follows:  a white blood cell count of
11,900, hematocrit of 26.3 and platelet count of 379,000.
The prothrombin time is 19.9 and the INR is 2.6.  There is a
sodium of 146 (which is down from 147 on [**2837-8-20**]), potassium
of 4.2, chloride of 107, bicarbonate of 29, BUN of 44 (which
was down from 50 yesterday), creatinine of 1.1 and blood
glucose of 55 this morning (which has come up with oral
juice.)

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  Neurologically, the
patient is alert and oriented, without apparent neurologic
deficit.  On pulmonary examination, the patient has coarse
rhonchi bilaterally with a few bibasilar crackles, left
greater than right.  The patient has a productive cough.  His
room air oxygen saturation is 95%.  The patient is in atrial
fibrillation, S1 and S2, without murmur.  The sternum is
stable.  The incision is intact with no drainage.  The
staples to the incision show no drainage or erythema.  The
abdominal examination is benign.  The patient is tolerating
his oral intake without problem.  [**Name (NI) **] is urinating
spontaneously.  Peripherally, the patient has warm
extremities with palpable pulses.  The left leg incision has
a small amount of serosanguinous drainage around the
incision.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Coumadin for atrial fibrillation with the patient to
receive 1 mg today with a target INR of 2.0
2.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Atrovent metered dose inhaler with spacer two puffs
q.i.d.
4.  NPH insulin 20 units subcutaneous q.a.m.:  The patient
had been on b.i.d. NPH insulin.  However, since he had been
on b.i.d. insulin and his tube feeds were discontinued, his
blood sugars in the morning had been on the low side and it
was felt more appropriate to simply give him NPH in the
morning only and to follow the rest of his blood sugars
q.i.d. with sliding scale insulin until the patient is eating
normally and then readjust his insulin dose at that time.
5.  Calcium carbonate 750 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6.  Pravachol 40 mg p.o. h.s.
7.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8.  Sliding scale regular insulin before meals and at
bedtime:  for a blood sugar of 150 to 200, three units; for
201 to 250, six units; for 251 to 300, nine units; and, for
301 to 400, 12x units.
9.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. times five days and then
p.o. q.d. times seven days, then 200 mg p.o. q.d.
10. Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. times three more days.
11. Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. times three more days.
