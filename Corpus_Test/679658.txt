   Assessment and Plan
   49 M found to have staphlyococcus aureus bacterial endocarditis with
   severe mitral regurgitation [**1-18**] mitral valve vegetations and flail
   leaflet, course c/b sepsis, neurological deficits.
    # Mitral valve staphylococcus aureus endocarditis/ Sepsis [**1-18**]
   staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: BCx grew out MSSA. ECHO shows large
   vegetation on mitral valve, possible small vegetation on aortic valve.
   - continue daily surveillance cultures: last positive cx on [**11-14**]
   - f/u cardiac surgery recs
   - to OR today for teeth extraction
   - TEE today to evaluate for abscess, aortic valve vegetation
   - monitor for new embolic events: if abdominal pain worsens would
   consider CT abdomen to evaluate for emboli to small bowel
   - f/u ID recs
 continue broadened Abx coverage, could narrow if no
   positive Cx and pt stable, increase Cefepime to q12h dosing as renal
   function has improved
   # Loose stools: Pt has been having loose stools since admission. Cdiff
   negative x2. Empirically treating with IV Flagyl and PO Vanc. WBC
   improved from 20 to 15.
   - f/u Cdiff #3
   - add banana flakes to tube feeds
   # Neurological deficits
 Neurological deficits continue to improve.
   - MRI head, optic nerves, and spine once patient stabilized
   - repeat CT angio head/neck later this week to r/o mycotic aneurysm
   - final treatment would be surgery
   # Delirium
 Pt agitated [**11-20**], requiring Haldol 19mg IV and Ativan 1mg
   IV. Appropriate and calm on [**11-21**] with standing Haldol.
   - f/u psych recs
   - continue Haldol, Ativan; monitor for QTc prolongation, EPS,
   akithesia, dystonia, TD, and NMS
   # Respiratory Distress
 Pt satting well on 4LNC.
   - continue Lasix; good UOP with Lasix 20mg IV
   - follow O2 requirement
   #ARF
 improvement in creatinine to 0.9 today (baseline 0.4).
   Multifactorial etiology for ARF in setting of multiple renal infarcts,
   recent gentamycin use, contrast load and low CO from MR.
   [**Name14 (STitle) **] to monitor UOP, Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   #Olecranon bursistis s/p washout
 no evidence of infection as per OR
   report and initial gram stain. Wound vac in place
   - f/u fluid cx - negative to date
   #Hypotension
 [**1-18**] to sepsis/ low cardiac output.  Pt weaned off
   levophed [**11-15**].
   - UOP has improved with milrinone, would continue
   #Hypoalbuminemia
 poor nutrition.  Dobhoff placed [**11-21**], Tube feeds
   started.
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD but heavy smoker
   - plan for Cath tomorrow
   - pre-medicate with Mucomyst and Bicarb gtt
   - NPO after MN
   # PUMP: Bedside ECHO done [**11-15**]. EF 55-60%.
   # RHYTHM:  Sinus tachycardia likely [**1-18**] volume depletion and
   bacteremia.
   #ACCESS: Right IJ triple lumen catheter
 placed [**11-15**]; replace with L
   subclavian today
   #PPX
 heparin

   #Access
