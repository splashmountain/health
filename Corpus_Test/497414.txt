Chief Complaint: Afib with RVR
   24 Hour Events: On arrival to the ICU the pt was given a 1L fluid bolus
   and spont converted to sinus rhythm. Pt was started on amiodarone gtt
   for atrial fibrillation, with the gtt she became bradycardic to the low
   40s. Amiodarone was stopped. The pt had contined loose stools
   overnight. She reverted back to a fib with rates in 110s and again
   converted back with IVF. She was found to have blood cultures with GNR
   and was started on flagyl for possible bowel source.

   consistent with pericardial effusion from CT chest from [**2897-5-9**].
   Mediastinal adenopathy is again appreciated without appreciable change.
   There
   is slight decrease in size of moderate bilateral effusions. No definite
   focal
   consolidation is identified to suggest pneumonia. Right PIC line tip
   terminates in the distal SVC.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 59F with mental retardation w/ recent dx of nodular
   sclerosing hodgkins lymphoma s/p modified EACOP, ileus,  now with
   febrile neutropenia and afib with RVR  in setting of GNR bacteremia.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: In the setting of fever, went into afib
   with HRs as high as 180s and SBP in 80s. She has had difficult to
   control afib in the past on max dose esmolol and diltiazem drips and
   finally converted with amiodarone during her last ICU visit.  It is
   likley that she has converted back into afib with RVR in the setting of
   fever and possibly hypovolemia given her recent worsened ileus. Pt was
   converted to NSR after receiving 1L NS upon arrival to the ICU. She was
   started on an amiodarone gtt at 0.5mg/hr. Following the initiation of
   the gtt she became bradycardiac with HR in the low 40s and the gtt was
   discontinued. She converted back to Afib with RVR with HRs in the
   110s-120s which broke again following IVF bolus. In this setting she
   was found to have continued volume loss from diarrhea and a positive BC
   with GNR.
   - Given bradycardia with IV amiodarone infusion, transition to po
   amiodarone load with goal of 7gm prior to transitioning to maintenance
   dose. Will start 400mg [**Hospital1 **]. Pt received approx 90mg IV total yesterday
   with a 0.5mg/min rate X 3 hours.
   - Monitor ECG and specifically QTc
   - no anticoagulation given hemopericardium
   - continue metoprolol and uptitrate as BP allows
   .
   # Febrile neutropenia: Now s/p cytoxan, doxorubin, etoposide,
   dexamethasone and procarbazine (last [**5-22**]). CXR unchanged, UA negative.
   Blood cultures with
 bottles GNR
   - f/u cultures - GNR bacteremia
   - Given pt
s dilated colon and recent rectal tube placement
 bowel
   likely source for GNR bacteremia. Pt was started on flagyl
   - C. diff to be sent this am
   - continue cefepime and vancomycin as long as neutropenic
   - Neutropenic precautions
   - monitor PICC line
   - continue GCSF
    .
   # Ileus/abdominal distention: Has this history, requires intermittent
   rectal tube (now out given neutropenia). Last BM loose stool overnight
   - Appreciate GI recs
   - For now continue full liquids. Will continue to monitor abdomen and
   for flatulence or BM
   - repeat KUB daily to monitor dilated bowel
   - Replete lytes aggressively, TSH wnl
   - IVF to keep up with diarrhea and insensible losses
   - Will need colonoscopy when counts are improved
   .
   # Hemopericardium: Moderate pericardial effusion per ECHO on [**5-10**]
   without evidence of tamponade. Hemodynamically stable. If develops
   persistent uncontrolled afib, discuss need to drain pericardial
   effusion with cards.
   - recheck ECHO
   - Pulses following conversion to NSR - 4
   .
   # Hypoxia: Encasement of pulmonary artery and left main bronchus by
   mediastinal mass per CT at NWH. Also with SVC compression on CT here
   during last admission. Significant improvement in these symptoms
   post-chemo as her tumor is likely very chemoresponsive. [**Month (only) 56**] also have
   pericardial thrombus, but given hemopericardium, not able to start
   heparin.  Also, has bilateral pleural effusions.
   - Continue to monitor for decreased tumor burden, reduced PA
   compression
   - Continue steroids x total of 14 days
   - Continue supplemental oxygen as needed, will wean as tolerated
   .
   # Lymphoma: NSHL as per pathology from supraclavicular LN biopsy. Stage
   2b at least per OMR note. Completed one cycle of modified regimen with
   cytoxan, etoposide and doxorubicin (C1D+10, procarbazine day +3 s/p 2
   doses). TL labs stable.
   - Continue decadron 20mg IV x14 days total, will discuss further
   treatment with team (like due for next cycle 21 days after C1)
   - Continue to monitor pericardial effusion as tumor shrinks
   - Cont allopurinol for now, will discuss length of treatment with BMT
   team
   - Restarted Neupogen [**5-24**], was held during procarbazine but will hold
   third dose of procarbazine today given rapid onset of neutropenia and
   GI disease.
   - PCP/HSV/VZV ppx to be started next week
   - Continue to follow ANC daily
   - Consider repeat CT Torso to further evaluate mediastinal mass/SVC
   compression in future
   .
   # Anemia: Chronic, iron deficiency anemia. Now s/p chemo Will continue
   to monitor.
   - Maintain Hct >25, plt >75 given hemopericardium  - received 2U PRBC
   and 1bag plts since transfer
   .
   # FEN: monitor lytes. neutropenic, liquid diet for now
