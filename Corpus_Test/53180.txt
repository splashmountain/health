HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 1589**] is an 85-year-old
female who was transferred from rehabilitation to the [**Hospital1 992**] on [**2621-11-1**], for
perfuse diarrhea associated with fevers.  Originally, this
85-year-old female was underwent left total hip replacement
secondary to a fracture in [**2621-9-29**].  She was
discharged to rehabilitation where she was up until
[**11-1**], the day when she was sent back to the Emergency
Room at the [**Hospital1 170**] for
evaluation due to her perfuse diarrhea and fevers.

On presentation, the patient complained of abdominal pain and
was noted to be hypotensive.  She was started empirically on
vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl and resuscitated with
6 units of crystalloid.  She remained hypotensive so she was
started on dopamine.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   (Her other past medical history
includes)
1.  Urinary tract infections.
2.  Depression.
3.  Arthritis.
4.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
5.  Compression fracture of the lumbar disk.
6.  Right breast cancer.
7.  She is deaf in the left ear.
8.  Hard of hearing in the right ear.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  A CT scan of the abdomen showed diffuse
colonic thickening, and the differential included ischemic
versus infectious colitis.  With signs of peritonitis and
sepsis, and because the patient was not improving she was
brought to the operating room and underwent an emergent total
abdominal colectomy and end-ileostomy.  Intraoperatively, the
patient was found to have a large amount of fluid in the
abdomen.  After the operation, she was transferred in a
critical condition to the Intensive Care Unit, intubated, on
pressors, and the antibiotics were ceftriaxone and Flagyl.

On [**2621-11-5**], the patient self extubated herself.
Antibiotics were continued as the patient continued to have
persistent elevated white blood cell count and fevers.  She
was doing reasonably well.  Total parenteral nutrition was
started on [**11-6**], and the sample from the stool that was
sent on [**2621-11-2**], was positive for Clostridium
difficile colitis.  Of note, after the surgery subsequent
stool samples tested negative for Clostridium difficile.

During this time, the patient continued to have small
temperatures and elevated white blood cell counts.
Orthopaedics was consulted, and an ultrasound of the left hip
revealed a fluid collection adjacent to the left femur
fracture site.  Orthopaedics did not feel that this was
evidence of infection, and it was most likely a resolving
hematoma.

On [**2621-11-8**], the patient developed tachypnea and
dropped her saturations requiring reintubation.  She had a
repeat CT of the abdomen which showed bilateral loculated
pleural effusions and a thickened rectal stump.  She required
pressor support again on and off.  The patient underwent an
ultrasound-guided thoracentesis on [**11-9**] and
approximately 500 cc of fluid were drained from her left
pleural site.

She continued on full support and on intravenous antibiotics,
but despite this she never completely improved.  By
[**2621-11-15**], it was decided among the clinical staff and
the family that the patient would be extubated and made do
not resuscitate/do not intubate and give her a chance to
improve.

The patient has been requiring nasal suction to raise
secretions, and her saturations have been 80s to 90s with 60%
face tent.  Her systolic blood pressure was between 80s to
100s, and heart rates between 90s to 120s.  The patient was
made comfort measures only on [**2621-11-19**], by the family
and the clinical staff.  A morphine drip was started.
Antibiotics and other medications were discontinued.  A Foley
was kept to gravity with an average urine output of 30 cc to
40 cc an hour.

The son of the patient, Mr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 22426**], is the power of
attorney.

The patient was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Surgical
Intensive Care Unit on [**2621-11-20**], and today she is
being transferred to a rehabilitation facility to continue
her care and comfort measures only protocol.
