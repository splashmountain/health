HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89 yaer old
Portuguese speaking woman admitted for shortness of breath.
She was recently discharged on [**2910-12-8**] with a
resolving chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation
and now presents again with shortness of breath.

The patient received nebulizer treatments en route, with
minimal improvement.  The patient says she normally sleeps on
two pillows and does not have any problems with swelling of
her feet.   She has not had a cough.  She also describes some
pain in her back.  She denies chest pain or pain radiating to
her jaw.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Coronary artery disease, status
post coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2902**].  2.
Hypertension.  3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  4.
Status post cholecystectomy.  5.  History of pulmonary
embolism.  6.  Peripheral vascular disease.  7.  Chronic
renal insufficiency.  8.  Diabetes mellitus.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lisinopril 40 mg p.o.q.d.,
Coumadin 5 mg p.o.q.h.s., Lasix 40 mg p.o.q.d., Isordil 30 mg
p.o.t.i.d., aspirin 81 mg p.o.q.d., NPH 16 units q.a.m. and 6
units q.p.m., regular insulin sliding scale, albuterol and
Atrovent nebulizers, home oxygen, Lipitor 10 mg p.o.q.h.s.,
diltiazem 120 mg p.o.b.i.d., Combivent, Prilosec 20 mg
p.o.q.d., Meclizine 12.5 mg p.o.b.i.d., Paxil 10 mg p.o.q.d.,
iron sulfate 325 mg p.o.t.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is from [**Country 3537**] and lives
with her daughter.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on admission,
the patient had a temperature of 98.6, heart rate 110, blood
pressure 153/90, respiratory rate 20 to 25 and oxygen
saturation 98% on two liters.  General:  Awake and alert.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention.  Chest:  Moderate
end-expiratory wheezes with fair movement, not using
accessory muscles.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm,
normal S1 and S2, no S3 or S4, 1+ systolic murmur.  Abdomen:
Soft, obese, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  Without
edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially worked up by the
night float and was planned to be admitted to the medical
floor, however, she began to have increasing shortness of
breath during her time in the Emergency Room and she was
eventually admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for
observation.

The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit where,
with her troponin, she ruled in for a non-Q wave myocardial
infarction.  The patient also then had an episode of
supraventricular tachycardia.  She was started on a diltiazem
drip to control her heart rate.  Her Isordil was increased
and she was placed on heparin for 48 hours.

The patient had an echocardiogram, which showed 2+ mitral
regurgitation, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation, mildly depressed
left ventricular function with questionable hypokinetic
septum and a small pericardial effusion; the mitral
regurgitation was new since her echocardiogram in [**2910-6-1**].

The patient's cardiac enzymes showed a CK going from 36 to 42
to 159 and troponin 8.7 increasing up to 25.1.  Cardiology
was consulted and made recommendations.  After 48 hours on
intravenous heparin, she was switched to Plavix.
Conservative management was chosen at this time, however, she
is going to follow up with a dobutamine echocardiogram.

The patient has poor functional status at baseline.  She says
she lives in a [**Location (un) 9912**] apartment, however, she does not
ever leave the apartment due to inability to climb stairs.

The patient also began to have an increasing creatinine up to
1.8 during admission, as well as a BUN which increased to 48.
A renal ultrasound was done which showed no evidence of
hydronephrosis and no stone.  Her renal function improved
with intravenous fluids.

The patient was also placed on Prednisone as well as Levaquin
for a possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare
partially contributing to her shortness of breath.  She was
placed on a Prednisone taper, which is to gradually taper
over 12 days.

The patient's chest x-rays during admission showed a tortuous
aorta with an enlarged heart size, extensive pleural
calcification and left hemithorax as well as a right lung
which was grossly clear.  This was consistent with her prior
chest x-rays.

Cardiology was reconsulted and made recommendations for
discharge medications, including switching Lopressor to
atenolol, restarting the patient's ACE inhibitor now that her
creatinine has come down, and switching over to Imdur.

At this time, we are still waiting for the patient's primary
care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 8395**], to tell us a little bit more
about her history of pulmonary embolism.  She had been on
Coumadin in the past, prior to admission, for a pulmonary
embolism that occurred sometime around [**2909-6-1**].  The
question is whether she needs chronic anticoagulation with
Coumadin.  If she does, we will discharge her on aspirin and
Coumadin.  However, if her primary care physician feels she
no longer needs Coumadin, then we will discharge her instead
on aspirin and Plavix.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is being discharged to a
rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

1.  Non-Q wave myocardial infarction.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is scheduled to have a dobutamine
echocardiogram on [**2911-1-20**] at 9:45 a.m. on the
seventh floor of the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Building.  The patient is
