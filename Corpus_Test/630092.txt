   Rt main
   bronchus. emphysema w/ basilar bronchiectasis and bronchial wall
   thickening
   probably due to chronic aspiration. new tiny bilateral pleural
   effusion,
   perihepatic and perisplenic fluid. colonic diverticulosis without
   evidence of
   diverticulitis. right shoulder joint effusion partially imaged.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known patient lastname 4595**] is a 66 year-old nab with a PMHx of stage 4 COPD (FEV1
   0.65L;FEV1/FVC 37% predicted in [**5-25**]) on 4L home o2 with numerous
   hospitalizations for COPD exacerbations and intubation, hypertension,
   coronary artery disease, GERD who presents with SOB and CP; admitted to
   the ICU for management of dyspnea and hypotension
   # SIRS/?Sepsis:  Has sepsis physiology with tachycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, though no clear source.  However, received CXR before
   being hydrated, and could also have evidence of infection in other
   areas with suppression while on steriods.  CT chest prelim suggests
   consolidation related to chronic aspiration.
   - will cont vanc/zosyn for now pending culture data
   - stress dose steroids with Hydrocortisone Na Succ. 50 mg IV Q8H
   - f/u final read of CT chest and abdomen
   - IVF boluses prn
   - trend lactate
   - defer CVL for now but will follow closely
   - f/u blood cx
   # Dyspnea/chest pain:  Likely secondary to COPD exacerbation but DDx
   also includes pneumonia, particularly given leukocytosis, bronchitis,
   ACS, and pulmonary embolism.  Has been hospitalized multiple times for
   COPD exacerbation and his recent history of running out of his
   albuterol/ipratropium inhalers at home is consistent with this
   presentation.
   - will start azithromycin and continue vanc/zosyn and hydrocortisone
   empirically for COPD exacerbation
   - ipatroprium and albuterol nebs standing and prn
   - f/u blood cx
   - sputum cx though not currently coughing
   - repeat CXR in a.m.
   - ROMI with cardiac enzymes
   - will defer on chest CTA
   # Hypotension:  Likely secondary to sepsis physiology vs volume
   depletion given history consistent with decreased po intake.  Arterial
   line placed.
   - sepsis management as above
   - IVF boluses
   - follow blood pressure
   # CAD s/p NSTEMI:  Acute on chronic chest pain unlikely to be ischemic
   in etiology.  CEs neg x 3.
   - will clarify why patient is not on aspirin (likely related to history
   of GIB)
   - will also clarify why patient is not on a BB (likely because of COPD)
   and statin
   # Lower back pain:
   - continue fentanyl patch
   FEN: heart healthy diet, IVFs as above
   Access: 2 PIVs
   PPx: pneumoboots, heparin sc, PPI, bowel reg, continue ppx bactrim
   Code: full but explicitly states that he does not want to be intubated
   for COPD exacerbations; he agrees to intubation for cardiac arrest
   unrelated to COPD
   DISPO: ICU for now
