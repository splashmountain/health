Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo man with h/o CAD s/p CABG, CHF, DM, PVD who initially
presented with NSTEMI complicated by respiratory distress.

1) CAD:  Pt with known CAD and is s/p CABG ([**3033**]) and cath
([**3045**]) showing 2VD and PTCA of SVG->RCA.  On admission was c/o
CP and SOB; ECG was unremarkable but had positive cardiac
enzymes.  Heparin, Integrilin and Nitro IV infusions started as
well as continued Pt on ASA, BB, ACEi and statin.  Pt to floor
with expectation of possible catherization in AM.  Catherization
later that day significant for hemodynamics of CVP 5, PAP 43/15,
PCWP 11 and CO 4.69/CI 2.59.  It showed right dominant system
with 30% LMCA, Diag 60%, LCx TO with collaterals, RCA TO with
collaterals, SVG->OM TO, SVG->RCA patent with jump to PDA
patent.  The thinking being that the culprit lesion was probably
an occlusion of a small PDA, not a good PCI target thus no
intervention was taken.  Vent-gram at the time showed preserved
LV function (40%) when compared to [**3044**].  Cath course was
without complication.  Pt was maintained on medical regimen as
outlined above.  Nitro gtt was slowly tapered off with
up-titrating of ACEi for good BP control and no return of chest
pain.  CE's peaked during that first day and quickly trended
down.  Pt never complained of CP for remaining of hospital stay.
 Pt to be discharged on a home regimen of ASA, BB, Statin, ACEi
as detailed below.  Pt to follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 237**] as an
outpatient.

2) Pump:  At cath LV function preserved with LVEF 40%.  HD were
significant for normal right sided and mildly elevated left
sided filling pressures with mild pulmonary hypertension.  CXR
at admission with some suggestion of CHF.  On admission was in
mild respiratory distress requiring oxygen by face mask.  Pt
received several doses of Lasix with good diuresis  but minimal
improvement in respiratory status..  On the floor, Pt with
respiratory failure (described below).  Given clinical picture
and history CHF was suspected etiology.  Pt not improved with
diuresis and eventually required intubation.  Pt was a confusing
picture since on exam Pt appeared volume overloaded and in CHF
given rales and CXR, however intra cath PCWP of only 11.  There
was some question as to nitro's effect on depressing the wedge
pressure.  Given as fore-mentioned HDs, aggressive diuresis not
warranted, however Pt given Lasix to keep Pt negative volume
status.  During initial period of intubation, Pt became
hypotensive and transiently required pressor support, bringing
up the possibility of septic component vs. cardiogenic.
Fortunately pressor support was required for only a short period
of time and weaned off quickly.  Pt extubated and nitro weaned.
Pt's ACEi was up titrated and continued on BB.  Once extubated
Pt suffering from difficult to control hypertension.  Eventually
requiring the addition of HCTZ, Amlodipine and increasing in
BB/ACE. Pt will need close follow up as an outpatient with often
titrations in his anti-hypertensive regimen. At time of
discharge Pt euvolemic not requiring daily Lasix.  Pt instructed
to follow a strict low salt diet and to weigh himself daily and
report any major changes to PCP.

3) Respiratory Failure:  On presentation to the [**Name (NI) **], Pt was
hypoxic requiring O2 by NRB to maintain adequate saturation.  Pt
initially stabilized, but quickly on the floor became more short
of breath with desaturations to the 70's.  ABG on NRB in setting
of SBP 180's 7.30/50/60. Given status, Pt eventually required
intubation and mechanical ventilation after trial of
non-invasive positive pressure ventilation failed. Initial
working diagnosis, as described above, was CHF given Pt's
history.  However it was difficult to correlate it with his cath
swan numbers from earlier on in the day.  So other etiologies
such as PNA and ARDS were considered early on.  Initially Pt
treated with supportive care and empiric antibiotics.  Chest CT
was obtained which showed Interstitial Lung Disease; findings
consistent with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with possible
superimposed infection and/or alveolar hemorrhage.  Given the CT
results, resp. failure of unknown etiology and brief hemoptysis
a Pulmonary consult was ordered.  Per their opinion alveolar
hemorrhage was very unlikely, and hemoptysis likely secondary to
an underlying PNA.  They believed that the pulmonary fibrosis
was chronic and needs outpatient workup. A bronch was
unrevealing and washings unremarkable.  Pt did well with
intubation and was weaned to PSV on day #2 and successfully
extubated that AM.  Pt quickly transitioned from NRB to 5L NC.
Given overall picture it is our impression that Pt's respiratory
demise most likely related to initial component of mild failure
with a PNA on top of chronically poor lungs.  Pt to be continued
Levofloxacin for 14 total days and follow up in the pulmonary
clinic in a few months to work-up his interstitial fibrosis.
