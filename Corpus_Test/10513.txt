Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 34 year old
morbidly obese female with a history of sleep apnea requiring
assist control ventilation and now presenting with fevers,
chills and headache since [**3225-4-18**].  She complains of nausea,
low back pain likely chronic and mild photophobia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Obstructive sleep apnea.
2.  Asthma for which she was intubated and tracheostomy.

ALLERGIES:   The patient is allergic to Percocet and Vicodin
for which she gets a rash.

MEDICATIONS:  She is on Fluticasone inhaler, Fioricet,
Heparin subcutaneous, Salmeterol, Venlafaxine and Albuterol.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Headache - The patient had symptoms consistent with
meningitis versus subarachnoid versus sinusitis.  In terms of
meningitis, she is being treated empirically with Ceftriaxone
and Vancomycin due to inability to do a lumbar puncture given
her size.  She has a low grade temperature but no elevated
white blood cell count throughout her hospital stay.

2.  In terms of subarachnoid, it is unlikely.  Neurologic
checks q4hours did not show any focal deficit.

3.  In terms of sinusitis,  she has symptoms of maxillary
tenderness, though x-ray did not show any fluid levels in her
sinuses.  However, she was given Pseudoephedrine throughout
the course to alleviate it.  Her headache did go down from
ten out of ten to five out of ten and continues to get
better.

4.  In terms of her fever, she has an unclear etiology,
likely infectious, but urinalysis was clear.  Chest x-ray was
clear.  Blood cultures are pending.  Given that temperature
is coming down, it is reassuring.

5.  Depression - She continued her Effexor.

6.  Pulmonary - She continued on her ventilation at home for
obstructive sleep apnea.

In terms of her discharge, she received a PICC line in her
arm to receive her antibiotics for meningitis and she will
continue a ten day course.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Question rule out meningitis.
2.  Obstructive sleep apnea.
3.  Depression.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Pseudoephedrine.
2.  Ceftriaxone two grams intravenously q12hours.
3.  Vancomycin one gram q12hours.
4.  Salmeterol one puff twice a day.
5.  Fluticasone 110 mcg two puffs twice a day.
