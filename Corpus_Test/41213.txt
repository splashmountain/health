Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**3125-6-23**] Cardiac Catheterization
[**3125-6-25**] Redo mitral valve replacement ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1044**] [**Male First Name (un) 357**]
Bioprosthetic) via right thoracotomy and atrial septal defect
closure

History of Present Illness:
80 year old female with a history of prosthetic mitral valve 8
years ago, who now has worsening prosthetic valve stenosis that
is causing progressive shortness of breath and lower extremity
edema which has been treated medically. In [**3125-3-17**], she was
deemed inoperable. Stated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at that
time, if after balloon valvuloplasty her PA pressures return to
normal and her RV recovers, she may be a candidate for surgery.
She underwent valvuloplasty on [**3125-3-31**].  She returns today for
repeat cath and echo to further evaluate efficacy of
valvuloplasty based on response of PA pressures.  Last dose of
coumadin was [**3125-6-18**] and she will be admitted post cath for
heparin and pre-op workup.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. Probable thrombus in the
LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. A catheter
or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No
ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Small LV cavity. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity. RV function depressed.
Abnormal septal motion/position consistent with RV
pressure/volume overload.
AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta
diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta. No thoracic
aortic dissection.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AS. No
AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis (MVR).
Thickened MVR leaflets.. Increased MVR gradient. Severe valvular
MS (MVA <1.0cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-18**]+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate [[**1-18**]+] TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Mild PR.
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The LAA has been ligated.
A probable thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. No
thoracic aortic dissection is seen.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The
prosthetic mitral valve leaflets are thickened. The gradients
are higher than expected for this type of prosthesis. There is
severe valvular mitral stenosis (area <1.0cm2). Mild to moderate
([**1-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
POST-CPB:
There is a new bioprosthetic valve in the mitral position. The
valve is well-seated with normal leaflet motion. There is no MR.
A trivial paravalvular jet is seen at the 7-o-clock position.
The peak gradient across the mitral valve posthesis is 17mmHg,
the mean gradient is 8mmHg with CO of 4.7. The MVA by PHT is
1.7cm2.
The RV systolic function remains depressed, however appears
slightly improved from pre-op. (The pt is on milrinone and
norepi infusions as well as inhaled NO.) The LV systolic
function remains normal, estimated EF is 60%.
The aortic valve remains normal in structure and function. The
TR has decreased to trace.

Final Report
INDICATION: Evaluate for effusion after MVR.

COMPARISON: Multiple radiographs dating back to [**3125-6-23**], most
recently
[**3125-6-27**].

FINDINGS: The patient is status post mitral valve replacement
with intact
median sternotomy wires. The right internal jugular introducer
has been
removed. Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
right, and
associated atelectasis are stable. The right mid lung pleural
density is
unchanged from [**3125-6-26**] but is new from [**3125-6-23**] and is likely a
loculated
pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Aortic valve
calcifications are
re-demonstrated. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes and hilar
contours are
stable. Right axillary clips are again noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis, left greater
than right, are
stable.
2. Small right loculated pleural effusion.






Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] presented for cardiac catheterization on [**6-23**] and was
admitted post procedure for preoperative workup. On [**6-25**] she was
brought to the operating room and underwent redo mitral valve
replacement and atrial septal defect via right thoracotomy.
Please see operative report for further details. She received
cefazolin and vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics and was
transferred to the intensive care unit for post operative
management. She was paced coming out of the operating room with
an underlying rhythm of atrial fibrillation. Post-op she had
some hypotension that required Levophed and Milrinone. Due to
hemodynamics she remained intubated until post-op day two. On
this day she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically
intact and extubated. In addition to continuing pre-op
medications, she was started on beta-blockers and diuretics and
diuresed towards her pre-op medications. On post-op day three
she was difficult to arouse and a stat head CT and neuro consult
were performed. CT was negative and neurology thought her mental
status was from sedative medications. Chest tubes and epicardial
pacing wires were removed per protocol. Coumadin was restarted
and titrated for a goal INR of [**2-18**].5. The following day she was
transferred to the step-down unit for further recovery where she
worked with physical therapy for strength and mobility. On
post-op day five she appeared to be doing well and was
discharged to rehab with the appropriate medications and
follow-up appointments.
