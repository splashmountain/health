Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Dynamic interatrial septum. No
ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Low
normal LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus. Normal ascending aorta
diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Mildly dilated descending
aorta. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: No MS. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Physiologic TR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

POST-BYPASS: Pt is on an infusion of phenylephrine and is being
A paced

1. [**Hospital1 8**]-ventricular function is uncahnged.
2. Aorta is intact post decannulation
3. Other findings are unchanged


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 4872**] was admitted to cardiac surgery. Preoperatively he was
87% saturated on room air. He was seen and followed by renal
preop and postop. He was taken to the operating room on [**11-18**]
where he underwent a CABG x 4. He was transferred to the ICU on
propofol and neo. He was given 48 hours of periop vancomycin as
he was in the hospital preoperatively. He was extubated on POD
#1, and transferred to the floor on POD #2. He did well
postoperatively, and was ready for discharge home on POD #7.Pt.
is to make all followup appts. as per discharge instructions.
