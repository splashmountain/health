Chief Complaint: respiratory distress
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Fellow for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   44 y/o F admitted with NSTEMI, course complicated by persistent fevers,
   altered mental status, elevated LFTs, and urine eosinophilia.  Her
   overall picture is confusing and perhaps suggestive of a vasculitis
   given the persistent fevers and multisystem disease.  However, multiple
   serologies for rheumatologic disease are negative to date.  Also, ? of
   a hypercoaguable state given RCA thrombosis and multiple infarcts on
   head MRI.
   24 Hour Events:
 ARTERIAL LINE - STOP [**3225-9-4**] 01:00 PM
   Diuresis attempted yesterday.  Got lasix 40 IV and then 80 IV without
   response in UOP.  BUN and creatinine continue to rise.  Then got NS 500
   cc boluses x3.
   Appeared more tachypneic this morning, so placed back on ventilator.

   Assessment and Plan
   44 y/o F admitted with NSTEMI, course complicated by persistent fevers,
   altered mental status, elevated LFTs, and urine eosinophilia.
   Vasculitis workup has been negative to date.  Now afebrile & off of
   antibiotics, with worsening renal failure and persistently altered
   mental status.
   1. Respiratory failure:  Placed on PSV earlier this AM for tachypnea,
   but respiratory rate appears unchanged over past 10 days.  Will try
   trach collar again today.
    - trach collar today, repeat VBG
    - cont albuterol and atrovent
   2. s/p MI:  s/p BMS to RCA.  Most recent echo with preserved EF.
    - cont aspirin, beta-blocker, plavix
    - holding ace given renal failure
   3. Altered mental status:  Unclear cause of findings on MRI.  TTE
   negative, TEE negative for vegetations.
   - uremia is likely the primary cause of her somnolence at this point
   - off propofol
   - CK continuing to rise of unclear etiology - will discuss ?myopathy
   with neuro
    4. Elevated LFTs:  Likely related to muscle breakdown as CK is also
   elevated.  Alk phos and total bili have been normal.
   - GGT elevated so some component of this is hepatic
   -  aldolase pending
   5. ARF:  BUN and creatinine continue to rise and seemed to worsen with
   the administration of lasix despite not effectively diuresing.  This
   suggests that she is somewhat volume depleted although for LOS is
   likely extremely positive.  Will give additional IVF today but wonder
   if she would benefit from dialysis given ? of BUN contributing to
   mental status.
   6. ? Hx EtOH abuse:  Cont thiamine, folate, mvt.  Will d/w Neuro
   whether any of this could be Wernicke's.
   7. Leukocytosis:  Has been persistent but worsened today.  Afebrile.
   Will add on differential.  No abx for now, f/u cx.
   8. Hypernatremia:  Replete free water - will switch to IV as unclear
   how much she absorbs given her gastric bypass.
