   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6879**] is a 82M with CAD s/p CABG, systolic
   CHF who presents with dyspnea on exertion for 3 days duration.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: Patient's symptoms of dyspnea on exertion most
   concerning for CHF exacerbation in the context of medical
   noncompliance.  No concern for infection at this time.
   - Lasix 60 mg IV for goal urine ouput > 150 cc/hr, -1L 24 hours (add
   dose of IV lasix given this AM)
   - Continue outpatient medications Metoprolol 25 mg qd (convert to short
   acting due to bradycardia), ASA
   - Daily weights, strict I/O, low Na diet, fluid restrict 1.5 L
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Wean off oxygen as tolerated
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # RHYTHM: Rate controlled atrial fibrillation. Patient
   supra-therapeutic on coumadin (CHADS2 score = 6).
   - Continue outpatient medications Metoprolol 25 mg qd (convert to short
   acting due to bradycardia)
   - Hold warfarin due to INR 4, will re-start at 7.5 q day when INR is in
   therapeutic range
   .
   # Coronaries: 3vd s/p CABG
   - Continue ASA, statin, BB
   - Hold Lisinopril due to acute renal failure (see below).
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Hyaline casts on Ua suggest poor perfusion.
   Creatinine elevated mildly from baseline of 1.1.
   - renally dose all meds
   - hold Lisinopril in setting of aggressive diuresis
   - replete K to 4
   - follow creatinine, urine lytes pending
   .
   # HTN
   - Continue amlodipine
   - Hold Lisinopril due to acute renal failure
   .
   # DM
   - Continue NPH with sliding scale
   .
   # Depression
   - Continue celexa, risperidone
   .
   # Glaucoma
   -          Continue Brimonidine/Dorzolamide/Timolol
