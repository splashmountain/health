   42 y/o with Common VID, HepC, Type 1 DM, p/w c. diff sepsis, c/b ARDS
   and respiratory failure s/p trach
   # Sepsis: Pt developed fever, new oxygen requirement last week,
   suspected VAP, no growth from BAL. Micofungin added [**1-31**], d/c
d [**2-3**].
   Meropenum added back per ID [**1-30**]
 8 day course of Meropenum completed
   [**2-6**]. [**Month/Year (2) 2541**]/Micafungin d/c
d [**2-4**]. Sinus CT findings could be consistent
   with sinusitis but impossible to say definitively, getting nasal NS.
   WBC count increased from 22 to 34 but afebrile.  Cultured broadly, so
   far negative except yeast.  CT abdomen/pelvic [**2-10**] without clear
   source.
   - PO Vanco & IV Flagyl for C Diff
   - hold TFs for now
   - On [**Last Name (un) 339**] / [**Last Name (un) 2541**] restarted [**3391-2-10**] with increased leukocytosis, unclear
   source
   - Stop [**Name (NI) 2541**] - no positive cultures
   - will continue to consider pulling PICC, CVL
   - paracentecis (therepeutic / diagnostic) completed [**2-10**]; follow-up
   cultures
   # C diff sepsis:  now s/p Xigris and IVIG.  Colitis appears improved on
   serial CT scans of the abdomen.  Afebrile. Lactate stable.  have d/c
   Vancomycin retention enemas. Holding scope although ongoing pain given
   risk of perforation
   - continue PO Vancomycin via NGT, IV flagyl
   - appreciate ID recs:  dose IVIG weekly Q Saturday
   - Surgery following, have not seen in a while, no significant change on
   CT [**2-10**]
   - follow bladder pressures ([**2-9**] was 18
 [**2-10**] s/p paracentesis down
   to 4)
   - hold TFs
   # Respiratory failure:  Developed PNA.  Back on vent for resp distress.
   - Continue vent for now; try to place on TM with only vent for
   transitioning once acute issues stabilized
   - FIO2 40%
   - Attempt diuresis restart [**2-11**]
   - f/u renal rec
   # Mental status: Somewhat decreased over the last few days, concerning
   for new infection given abx stopped on [**2-6**]. CT head [**2-10**] w/o acute
   process.  Likely some component of hepatic / toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy
   - limit sedating meds; infection as above
   - octreotide, midrodrine for hepatoreanl syndrome
   - requesting HD from renal
   # Anemia:  HCT trending down, stabilized. Neg DIC labs.
   - Trend HCT, transfuse for HCT<21
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Guaiac stools & daily HCT
   - epo 3x week
   # Renal Failure:  Creat up, likely intravascularly dry but total body
   overloaded. FeUrea <.1, EOS in urine.  ? related to Vanco and [**Last Name (un) 339**].
   Hyperkalemic [**2-4**] treated for hyperK with calcium, bicarb, insulin,
   dextrose, and kayexalate
 DO NOT give further kayexylate
 K now in
   normal range. Checked 4h CrCl on [**2-7**] which was 22 (very poor).  Low
   urine Na c/w haprotrenal syndrome
   -  Renal c/s, may need CVVH soon given rising BUN:Cr
   - Albumin PRN, but will not give standing
   - Renally dose meds
   - Start EPO [**2-11**]
   - requesting HD [**12-20**] encephalopathy and BUN >100
   - octreotide, midrodrine
   # DM Type I: Developed DKA while here. Hypoglycemic again overnight,
   glucose has been difficult to control.
   - holding TFs
   - TPN with insulin, increase insulin in TPN by 5pts today
   - Blood sugars running low
 concern for possible evidence of liver
   function declining vs sepsis
   # Cirrhosis:  chronic HCV infection. Liver consult team following,
   nothing further to do about Bili. Transaminases PRN
   # Coagulopathy: Acute worsening [**2-6**] with increased INR to 3.9, today
   3.3.  Unclear etiology whether worsening of liver unction or
   malnutrition or antibiotic effect.  DIC labs checked and normal [**2-7**].
   - Vit K challenge [**2-7**]
   - Trend, transfuse FFP PRN bleeding
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: likely multifactorial from underlying liver
   disease, acute illness, as well as contribution from hemolysis.  No
   iliary ductal dilatation by CT on [**1-20**] or [**1-30**]. Bili appears to be
   rising (from high teens to 22 to 28 to 26).  RUQ u/s w/o
   holedocholithiasis. Per liver [**2-3**], this is due to severe infection,
   and shouldn
t be evaluated further at this time.
    # Pain Management: Less of an issue given current mental status
   - Dilaudid prn; not using currently given her AMS for ?sepsis
   # Weakness: Likely ICU myopathy [**12-20**] prolonged illness, paralytics.
   Once improves pursue PT/OT & ultimately plan to rehab
   # FEN:  TF on hold for now  /  continue free H20 bolus /  TPN
   # PPx:   Pneumoboots as DVT prophylaxis / VAP bundle / PPI as GI ppx.
