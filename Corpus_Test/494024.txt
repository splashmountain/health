TITLE: MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I would emphasize
   and add the following points: 63F dCHF, severe PHTN s/p PFO closure,
   AF, DM, UC, LGIB, falls at home.
   Exam notable for Tm BP 100/44 HR 92 RR 18 with sat 99 on 3LNC. Frail
   confused woman, NAD. Oozing from R neck, JVD elevated. Coarse BS B.
   Irreg s1s2 [**3-11**] SM. Soft +BS. 2+ edema c large ecchymosis LLE. Labs
   notable for WBC 6K, HCT 22, K+ 4.6, Cr 3.0, lactate 1.1. CXR with
   cardiac enlargement, mild CHF.
   Agree with plan to manage blood loss anemia with PPI, serial HCT q6h,
   GI eval and plain films of L leg; no e/o rapid GIB or UC flare. Will
   manage hypotension with levophed for now, may be able to d/c pressors
   soon, CVP not an accurate reflection of preload - check mixed venous
   and lactate, place art line +/- PAC if she deteriorates. Diastolic CFH
   - likely acute on chronic worsening but very difficult to assess my
   exam or CVP - HD management as above. ARF on CRI - improving with
   resolution of anemia / shock. AF - hold BBL and anticoag. Needs SW eval
   for home safety. Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill
   Total time: 50 min
