   ulcer.
   -PICC placed successfully.
   -disimpaction performed in early evening, successfully removed moderate
   amount of firm brown stool, but unable to give adequate analgesia due

   Assessment and Plan
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
   82 y/o F with PMHx of severe dementia who presents with hypotension,
   dirty UA and massive stool ball.
   .
   #  Hypotension: Patient hypotensive on arrival in the setting of
   several weeks of poor PO intake.  The differential includes Sepsis vs
   hypovolemia, will trend lactates.  No evidence of bleeding at this
   time.  Concern about both urinary and gut bacteria for possible
   evolving sepsis.  Had some decreased blood pressures overnight, on
   Levophed for several hours.
   - Cipro, flagyl and cefepime.
   -significant fluid repletion yesterday - positive 6 liters with good
   urine output.
   - bolus PRN for hypotension.
   - continue to follow urine output, goal UOP >30cc/hr
   - lactate slightly elevated on admission, 1.2 after fluids
   - f/u Urine/blood Cx
   - obtain OSH records/Cx data
   - hold atenolol, triameterene/HCTZ
   .
   # Stool ball and impaction - extremely large stool ball, with several
   attempts at disimpaction yesterday.  Lack of rectal tones yesterday
   initially concerning for neurologic injury.  However, yesterday evening
   on exam and disimpaction she had fairly normal tone.
   - discussed with general surgery yesterday evening - planning to take
   to OR today.  Consent obtained.
   - unable to take PO yesterday, lactulose not given.
   - morphine PRN pain - mostly held for decreased BP.
   .
   # skin ulceration - buttocks and heel ulcerations.  Buttock ulceration
   very deep and concern re: possible abscess/fistula.
   - wound consult appreciated.
   - surgery will debride in OR today, consider possibility of osteo
   .
   # ?UTI- Ucx showed contam c stool, will resend
   .
   # Dementia - continue aricept.
   .
   # Depression - continue lexipro & depakote and mirtazapine
   .
   # FEN: IVF with NS @ 200ml/hr. clear fluid diet, NPO after MN for
   surgery.  replete electrolytes PRN
