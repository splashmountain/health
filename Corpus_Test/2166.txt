Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 420**]
Chief Complaint:
hemoptysis s/p right heart cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right heart catheterization
pulmonary artery coil embolization

History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:
CC:  80 yo F with AS s/p biprosthetic AVR in 12/99, MR with most
recent LVEF of 55%, Afib, asthma/COPD referred who was initially
referred for RHC +/- exercise, and possible LHC for progressive
shortness of breath who was found to have hemoptysis of 150 cc
during RHC after SGC was inflated.

Pt has had long history of SOB. Of note she was recently
hospitalized at [**Hospital3 1425**] hospital for worsening SOB
with dyspnea on exertion. She was treated for CHF with diuresis
and for her pulmonary disease and was d/c. At home pt reports
DOE and is unable to climb stair or walk far without symptoms.
She has no dyspnea at rest.Humidity exacerbates her SOB. She
sleeps with 1-2 pillows and denies PND or LE edema.

Recently the patient has been seen by her outpatient
cardiologist to determine whethere the SOB is directly related
to MR prior to any definitive treatment or surgical
intervention. For these reasons she was referred to have a RHC
+/- exercise +/- LHC/coronary angiography.
.
On review of system, pt reports dyspnea on exertion, cough,
hemoptysis.
.
She denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, black stools or red stools. She denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock
or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Cardiac catheterization [**2940-6-27**]:
1. Mild pulmonary aterial hypertension.
2. Moderate right ventricular diastolic heart failure.
3. Elevated PCW pressures consistent with at least moderate left

ventricular diastolic heart failure, with prominent V waves
consistent
with her known mitral regurgitation.
4. Exercise portion of the hemodynamic assessment was aborted
following
development of self-limited hemoptysis, likely due to rupture of
a
small right upper or middle lobe pulmonary arteriole and
secondary
pulmonary hemorrhage following inflation of the SGC balloon
after the
Swan-Ganz catheter had migrated more distally during calibration
of the
transducer system while the patient was sitting upright on the
exercise
ergometer and thus not amenable to fluoroscopic evaluation.

CXR ([**6-27**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
2. Nodular density projects over the heart. Recommend PA and
lateral views when possible.

CXR ([**6-28**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Nodule no longer visualized.
2. Chronic mediastinal widening with new right apical extension.
If the
patient has referable findings such as chest pain or Horner
syndrome, CT is indicated to evaluate for right apical lung
lesion. If CT is going to be performed for hemoptysis, this
finding will be evaluated at that time.
3. Possible right neck hematoma. Correlate clinically.

CTA chest ([**6-30**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Partially thrombosed pseudoaneurysm in right middle lobe
medial segment pulmonary artery with localized surrounding
hemorrhage, but no active extravasation.
2. Retained catheter fragment in the main pulmonary artery.
3. Contrast refluxing into the IVC suggests right heart
dysfunction.
4. Mild enlargement of the main and central pulmonary arteries
suggests
pulmonary hypertension.
5. Left renal hypodensity can be further evaluated with renal
ultrasound if clinically indicated.

COIL EMBOLIZATION PROCEDURE ([**2940-7-5**])
FINDINGS: The right pulmonary arteriogram, as well as selective
arteriograms of the segmental arteries supplying the middle lobe
of the right lung did not show evidence of the small
pseudoaneurysm seen on CT.
Three-dimensional rotation angiography as well as cone beam CT
reconstructions also failed to precisely demonstrate filling of
the pseudoaneurysm.
COMPLICATIONS: No immediate complications.
IMPRESSION: Inability to precisely demonstrate the 1-cm
pseudoaneurysm seen to arise from the right pulmonary artery
within the right lung-middle lobe. A followup CT pulmonary
arteriogram will be obtained to assess for persistence or
thrombosed status of the pseudoaneurysm.

CXR PA AND LATERAL ([**2940-7-8**])
Lung volumes are low. There is increased right infrahilar
opacity and possibly new left retrocardiac opacity compatible
with developing infection. Small bilateral pleural effusions are
increased. Heart size is severely enlarged as before. Sternal
wires are intact. Prosthetic aortic valve is unchanged.
Atherosclerotic calcification of aortic arch is present and
prominence of the mediastinal contour related to increased
ascending aorta diameter is better characterized on CT.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo F with cardiac history significant for AS s/p biprosthetic
AVR in 12/99, MR, Afib who initially presented for RHC +/-
exercise and possible LHC to evaluate her MR in the setting of
progressive SOB.  During catheterization, she developed
hemoptysis of 150 cc after the Swan Ganz Catheter was inflated
and was subsequently found to have partially thrombosed
pseudoaneurysm in RML pulmonary artery. An incidental finding of
(presumed) migrated epicardial pacing wire in the main pulmonary
artery was also noted.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

#DYSPNEA: No clear cause was discovered for the patient's
ongoing dyspnea. THe exercise portion of planned RHC was aborted
secondary to hemoptysis as below. She continued to complain of
some subjective DOE throughout her stay, though she maintained
oxygen saturations in the upper 90s with ambulation and symptoms
were stable to slightly improved from baseline. She will require
follow up with pulmonary and cardiology services to further
evaluate and manage her symptoms.

#HEMOPTYSIS: Pt had hemoptysis of 150 cc during RHC procedure
after the SGC balloon was inflated and was admitted to the CCU
for monitoring. She remained hemodynamically stable with no
transfusions required (Hct 31 at discharge from 38 on
admission). She had 2 episodes of blood tinged sputum on the
floor and anticoagulation was stopped. The interventional
pulmonary team was consulted and  CTA chest was obtained showed
evidence of partially thrombosed pseudoaneurysm in RML pulmonary
artery and retained catheter fragment in main pulmonary artery.
Old imaging records were obtained from [**Hospital3 1425**]
hospital which showed evidence of a foreign body in the
pulmonary artery (presumed to represent migration of an
epicardial pacing wire) present since [**2932**] [see also additional
discussion of the retained foreign body in OMR notes by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] [**2940-7-1**] and [**2940-7-3**]]. The primary team collaborated with
interventional radiology, cardiology, and pulmonary physicians
to determine the best course of action. At this time it was
decided that coil embolization of the pseudoaneurysm by IR to
prevent future bleeds was appropriate. However, given the
chronic nature of migrated epicardial wire, the decision was
made to leave the wire in place. Coil embolization was attempted
on [**7-5**], however, IR was unable to find the pseudoaneurysm
previously seen on imaging to arise from the R. pulmonary
artery, and recommended a follow up CT pulmonary arteriogram.
Following this procedure, she developed a low-grade fever and
cough; repeat CXR revealed a small infarct in RML as possible
soruce of her fever. She also had a small amount of hemoptysis
that was attributed to the infarct. It is recommended that she
follow up with CT with contrast 2 weeks post-procedure to to
further assess if pseudoaneurysm is present. Current plan is to
hold anticoagulation until after this study. Patient will need
follow up with pulmonary team.

#HOSPITAL ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA
Patient developed fever to Tmax of 102F and had CXR with
evidence of focal opacity concerning for infectious process vs.
RML infarct. Given prolonged hospital course patient was started
on cefepime for coverage of hospital acquired pneumonia. She was
transitioned to PO levaquin to finish a 7 day course of
antibiotics.

#UTI
Enterococcus was isolated from urine culture on [**7-6**]. The patient
had no urinary symptoms though UTI may have been a source
contributing to or causing her fever. This infection was likely
covered by the levofloxacin that the pt was already receiving
for possible pneumonia.

CHRONIC ISSUES:

#CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Pt remained comfortable during
hospitalization.  She required periodic boluses with IV lasix
for diuresis.  She will be discharged on lasix 40mg PO BID.

#HYPERTENSION: stable on home regimen of losartan 50mg [**Hospital1 **],
diltiazem ER 180 mg po BID, hydralazine 25 po BID.  Have
increased home dose of lasix to 40 [**Hospital1 **]

#A FIB: pt remained in afib during hospitalization with rates
70-80s.  Her anticoagulation is being held in the setting of her
pulmonary pseudoaneurysm until it can be further evaluated as an
outpatient with CTA.

#COPD/ASTHMA - stable.  Pt was continued on albuterol inhaler,
advair diskus and spiriva.

#HYPOTHYROID: continued outpatient regimen of levothyroxine

#DEPRESSION: continued home dose of mirtazapine

#GERD: continued pantoprazole

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
Pt was full code.  She will need to have close follow up with
CTA to further evaluate her pseudoaneurysm.  Anticoagulation is
being deferred until after results of CTA for risk of
hemoptysis.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known patient lastname 11413**],
It was a pleasure caring for you at [**Hospital1 18**]. You came to the
hospital for a catheterization to see if the cause of your
shortness of breath was related to your heart function. After
you were found to cough up blood and you were admitted to the
cardiac care unit for further monitoring. Testing revealed an
aneurysm and tear in the lingin of the pulmonary artery. Your
blood counts remained stable and you were able to breathe well
without any oxygen. You underwent a procedure to try to coil off
the pseudoaneurysm that was not able to cannulate the artery.
You will need to have another CT scan in about 2 weeks to
evaluate the pulmonary artery. We found a wire or catheter in
your pumonary artery that has been there for many years. It is
not recommended that this be removed.
You had some fevers that could be related to a small pneumonia
or from a small area of lung that was infarcted during the
pseudoaneuysm procedure. You completed a four day course of
antibiotics and will need 2 more doses (take every other day) to
complete a course. The cough and chest pain seems better.
You should continue taking all of your home medications except
for the following changes.
1. Take two more doses of the levofloxacin to treat the fevers
and possible pneumonia.
2. Please get your INR and electrolytes checked on [**2940-7-13**].
3. Start Spiriva for your breathing instead of the atrovent
nebulizers.
4. We have stopped your coumadin for now. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11407**] will
decide when to restart this medicine but likely after the CT
scan in 2 weeks. You will need to come back to [**Hospital1 18**] for this CT
scan so we can compare the two tests.

Followup Instructions:
