   Assessment and Plan
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Mr [**Known patient lastname 10311**] is a [**Age over 90 363**] year-old man with a history of severe CAD s/p CABG x
   2 and multiple PCIs, dCHF, DM, and CKD who presents with shortness of
   breath and respiratory distress
   # Respiratory failure:  Most likely acute on chronic CHF with elevated
   JVP and peripheral edema with pulmonary edema on CXR.  Etiology of
   exacerbation unknown: no evidence of recent ischemic event on admission
   (CE negative x 3).  ECHO with increased aortic stenosis, EF 45-50%.
   Possible component of chemical pneumonitis while down on field but no
   signs of pulmonary infection: no leukocytosis/ fevers and sputum
   sample/ flu negative.  s/p extubation with increased respiratory
   distress, sating only 94% on 5-6LNC. Currently having poor response to
   IV lasix and bumex.
   - d/c bumex
   - start chlorthalidone 500mg IV daily
   - start lasix drip at 10mg/hr with 160mg IV bolus and titrate to
   100cc/hr
   - strict ins/out
   .
   # CAD s/p CABGx2 and multiple stents, currently on medical
   mangagement:  Pt with substernal CP and back pain (anginal equivalent)
   yesterday. EKG without acute changes. Newly CE + in the setting of
   renal insufficiency.
   - continue ASA, clopidogrel (?), atorvastatin
   - transitioned back to home isosorbide (90mg q24hr)
   # HTN: Currently controlled. Home regimen includes BB and CCB.
   -          Restarted Carvedilol
   -          Wean nitro drip and restart nifedipine now that pt is
   tolerating NPO
   #  Acute on Chronic kidney injury:  Increased creatinine with
   aggressive diuresis: creatinine 2.2 from baseline of 1.3.  Has had
   acute renal failure in setting of diuresis in past, including previous
   admission for CHF exacerbation.
   - trend creatinine
   - continue diuresis
   - renally dose meds
   #  MDS/ Chronic Normocytic Anemia: Patient has known chronic anemia at
   baseline thought [**2-17**] myelodysplasia. Followed by Heme as outpatient. On
   Epo injections.
   - trend hct
   # Diabetes type 2:
   - finger sticks qachs
   - continue lantus and ISS
