   24 Hour Events:
   - Changed to coreg 3.125 and d/c'd dilt gtt. HRs up to 120s-130s. Gave
   another 3.125 coreg without effect (except BP down to 90s/50s).
   Switched back to lopressor 50mg but increased to TID. Then increased
   again to 75mg TID. HRs 90s overnight. BPs 120s.
   - Negative 300 at 3pm so did not get extra lasix (goal even)
   - INR 3 so gave another 5mg PO Vit K
   - Called ID for ABx approval but did not get call back

   Imaging: TTE:
   The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %). The estimated
   cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
   Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with
   Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta
   is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. There may be aortic stenosis with
   restricted leaflet opening but the overall transvalvular velocity is
   preserved (which may be secondary to poor ventricular contractile
   function). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
   moderate ([**11-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular
   inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
   elevated left atrial pressure. There is (at least) mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.
   .
   IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
   Moderate right ventricular hypokinesis. Elevated estimated left
   ventricular filling pressures. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
   At least mild pulmonary hypertension. Thoracic aortic dilation.
   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**55**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  The patient has 38 year old bypass grafts, with no more
   recent interventions.  In the setting of Type 2 DM, the likelihood that
   these grafts have restenosed is very high.  Most likely the stress of
   having a pneumonia with a fib precipitated this event.
   - Restart heparin drip
   - Continue plavix 75mg daily (s/p 600mg loading at OSH)
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Hold high dose statin given transaminitis
   - Continue beta blockers
   - Hold ACE-I given his acute on chronic renal failure and adverse
   reaction to lisinopril (hyperkalemia)
   - Plan for cardiac cath when INR less, however trending up, gave Vit K
   yesterday
   - Trend CE's until peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.
   - Lasix boluses for diuresis, goal UOP 100cc/hr
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE today to evaluate for fixed wall motion abnormalities and EF
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is in rapid ventricular rate
   currently.  The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs.
   v tach earlier today at OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 50mg PO BID
   - Continue diltiazem drip
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin, continue heparin drip for now
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'
   - CXR on admission
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2927-3-9**]
   - Will add vancomycin and ceftaz to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Will use metoprolol instead of home propranolol in the attempt to
   rate control
   - Will restart home amlodipine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  At OSH, T bili 2.6, direct
   0.6, AST 288, ALT 170, AP 106.  Trending up AST now 458, INR 3.9
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Hold statins for now
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   .
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV
   .
