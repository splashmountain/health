History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 3221**] is a 77 yo man with mulitvessel CAD s/p numerous
PCI, CHF (EF 30%), pulmonary hypertension, PVD, DM, who
presented to the ED with back pain since the night before,
consistent with his prior angina.  Further questioning
impossible due to critical illness.
.
In the ED his presenting vitals were: HR 120, BP 77/11, RR 25.
He rapidly decompensated with a Wide-complex tachycardia,
hypotension, respiratory distress. At somepoint he had a
bradycardic arrest and was given atropine, he was intubated,
started on dopamine & norepinephrine drips and was taken to the
cath lab for concern of ACS given his positive troponin.
.
In the cath lab he had what appeared to be a chronic LCX
occlusion which appeared to be chronic and was unable to be
crossed with a wire. He had an IABP placed, no other
interventions occurred. He remained hypotensive in the cath lab,
requiring dopamine drip at 20 & levophed at 0.25.  He was given
vancomycin + ceftriaxone for concern of urosepsis.

a mean pressure of 53 mmHg. His overall LVEF was 40-45%. Status
post PCI of the left main into the left circumflex with
rotational atherectomy (drug-eluting stent). Status post
angioplasty of the left main/left circumflex stent and
rotational atherectomy and stenting of the ostial right coronary
