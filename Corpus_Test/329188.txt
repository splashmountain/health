   Microbiology: Pleural fluid on R growing 4+ acinetobacter, sensitive
   only to bactrim (resistant to imipenem)
   Pleural fluid on L negative
   Assessment and Plan
   75 y/o M w/COPD, CAD, PVD, now with a complicated hospitalization s/p
   MRSA wound infection, admitted to the MICU with septic shock, likely
   source is pleural space.
   1. Shock:  BP improved overweekend. Likely source is pleural fluid as
   he is growing acinetobacter.
   - appreciate ID input; will discuss gram negative coverage with them as
   acinetobacter is resistant or insensitive to all antibiotics tested
   except for bactrim
   - continue stress dose steroids: today is day 4; will taper to 50 [**Hospital1 **]
   2. PVD/necrotic foot:  Eventually needs AKA and fem-fem bypass.
   Vascular surgery following.  On heparin gtt.
   3. CAD/CHF:  On aspirin, plavix, statin.  Per Cardiology, will need
   persantine MIBI prior to surgery but not currently ready for surgery so
   will hold off on this.
   - diurese today as appears volume overloaded, bp is stable
   4. Altered mental status:  Less interactive this AM.  Yesterday morning
   was reportedly A&O x3.  Has had intermittent delirium throughout
   hospital course.
   - repeat ABG
   - hold morphine for now
   5. AFib:  On metoprolol, heparin gtt.
