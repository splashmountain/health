   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo female with CAD s/p CABG with only patent LIMA-LAD, severe COPD
   admitted with likely lower GI bleed and NSTEMI.
   #hematochezia
   -goal Hct>30, will transfuse for goal Hct>30.  q6hr CBC, will likely
   need lasix for volume overload
   -will start prep for colonoscopy tomorrow, GI following
   -on [**Hospital1 **] PPI although likely this is LGIB
   -INR now 1.5 with vitamin K
   -has large bore IV (16 gauge, 20 gauge)
   #respiratory distress
   -likely due to volume overload
   -lasix for diuresis, will try CPAP as a bridge if needed
   #NSTEMI
   -in setting of anemia
   -transfuse for Hct>30, active type and screen, q6hr CBC
   -ASA on hold given GI bleed, on statin
   -until pulmonary edema improved will hold on beta blocker
   -CPAP if worsening hypoxemia
   -her cardiologist is following here
   #severe COPD
   -continue flovent, using atrovent in lieu of spiriva
    #atrial fibrillation
   -metoprolol on hold for now, rate still well controlled
