   Assessment and Plan
   63 year old woman with severe diastolic heart failure, severe tricuspid
   regurgitation presenting with decompensated heart failure in the
   setting of medication non compliance, admitted to CCU for initiation of
   ultrafiltration.
   .
   # ACUTE DECOMPENSATED DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Patient not responding
   to intravenous diuretics, remains massively volume overloaded and a
   risk of pulmonary edema and respiratory distress. A reported in the
   literature ([**Doctor Last Name 10985**], JACC [**2859**]) benefit to ultrafiltration in this
   setting.  Etiology of diastolic dysfunction unknown: consider
   infiltrative disease especially with evidence of nephritic range
   protienuria (see below)
   -- Initiate UF, goal 1.5 to 2L out today
   -- placement of temp CVVH line by IR today
   -- d/c diuretics while pt receiving CVVHD
   -- repeat TTE
   -- patient not on ACE-I or spironolactone
   .
   # CORONARIES: No history of CAD
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt with a-fib. Not on anti-coagulation given history of
   severe GI bleed.  Has significant bradycardia, although asymptomatic
   no confusion, dizziness, chest pain
   - d/c b blocker
   - pt not on full dose ASA and only on ASA 81mg
   - monitor on tele
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: Pt with baseline 1.2-1.4. On
   admission 1.8 and increased to 2.1 with diuresis and poor for[**Hospital1 **]
   flow.  However, patient only with minimal urine output with lasix gtt
   and metolazone. Plan for initiation of UF for volume removal.  U/A with
   nephrotic range proteinuria and significant edema.  Possible etiologies
   include amyloidosis, multiple myeloma, minimal change disease, other
   causes glomerular nephrosis
   -- f/u renal recs
   -- f/u SPEP/ UPEP, albumin/ creatinine ratio
   -- f/u lipid panel
   -- renal U/S
   -- avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - consider necessity of kidney/ heart or fat pad biopsy if suspicion
   for amyloidosis remains high
   .
   # UC: Patient w/ hx of Ulcerative Colitis. Pt with loose stools.
   - cont mesalamine 800mg TID
   - guaiac stools
   .
   #. Anemia: Hct 25.4 and stable over the last 72hrs. Likely combination
   of anemia [**2-7**] renal failure and possible GI loss given prior history.
   - acitve T&S
   - monitor Hct
   - guaiac stools
