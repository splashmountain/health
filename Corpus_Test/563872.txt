Chief Complaint:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with her
   note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
    71yo man with PSC, ESLD s/p recent MICU stay for variceal bleed and
   SBP represented to the MICU with recurrent bleed. EGD [**11-25**] with
   banding of varicies but no evidence of active bleed. Hct bumped to 30%
   transfusion but back down to 26% 12/24 AM. Mental status somewhat
   depressed yesterday possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy; his level
   of consciousness and interaction is better today.

   Assessment and Plan
   71yo man with PSC, ESLD, variceal bleeding s/p banding x 2, and chronic
   peritonitis.
 .H/O ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Improved mental status from yesterday; continue Lactulose. Follow
   clinically.
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
   Has been stable since his second banding 2 days ago. Hct stable since
   last transfusion. Will coordinate d/c
ing Octreotide drip in concert
   with Hepatology service. Will continue to follow [**Hospital1 **] Hcts at this time.
 PERITONITIS, SPONTANEOUS BACTERIAL (SBP)
   Chronic peritonitis on long-term antibiotics. Has been on Fluconazole
   since [**11-19**] and Vanc / [**Last Name (un) **] since [**11-25**]. Presumptively planning for a 2
   week course. Had planned to do a CT abdomen to assess for peritoneal
   inflammation or other intra-abdominal acute pathology; however, given
   his abdominal exam is very reassuring today, WBC is decreasing, will
   defer CT scan at this time.
 HYPONATREMIA
   Improved over the past several days with optimization of volume status.
   Follow daily.
 END STAGE LIVER DISEASE
   Can restart Nadolol for variceal prophylaxis. Follow BP with
   re-introducing this medicine.
