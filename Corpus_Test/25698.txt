Elective CABG

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**3004-8-16**] CABGx4(LIMA->LAD, SVG->[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], PDA)

History of Present Illness:
This is a 66 year old male who presented with acute
cholecystitis in [**3004-4-18**]. Preoperative evaluation was notable
for abnormal EKG(exact details unknown). This led to cardiac
catheterization which revealed severe three vessel coronary
disease. The LAD was totally occluded; the RCA had a 80-90%
stenosis while the circumflex had a 90% lesion. His LVEF was
estimated at 60%. Based on the above results, he was referred
for cardiac surgical intervention. Further evaluation included
an echocardiogram which showed no significant valvular disease
and a carotid ultrasound which showed normal internal carotid
arteries.

Of note, an ultrasound guided chole tube was placed in [**3004-4-18**]
and subsequently removed in mid [**3004-5-18**]. His cholecystitis
symptoms have completely resolved. In addition, he is currently
on PO Vancomycin for C. diff colitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 4287**] was admitted and underwent four vessel coronary artery
bypass grafting by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. The operation was uneventful and
he transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within 24
hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
incident. He was started on Plavix in addition to Aspirin for
poor distal coronary circulation. He maintained stable
hemodynamics and transferred to the SDU on postoperative day
one. He experienced paroxsymal atrial fibrillation for which
beta blockade was resumed and advanced as tolerated. Due to
persistent atrial arrhythmias, he was eventually started on
Amiodarone therapy and Warfarin. Warfarin was dosed for a goal
INR between 2.0 - 2.5. He otherwise continued to make clinical
improvements. At time of discharge, he was in a normal sinus
rhythm(rate 60-70) with systolic BP in the 100-120 mmHg range.
He was near his preoperative weight with room air oxygen
saturations of 95%. He was medically cleared for discharge to
home on postoperative day 7.
