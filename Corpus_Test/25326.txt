History of Present Illness:
38 year old male with h/o CAD s/p 2 vessel CABG, biventricular
pacemaker placement, dilated cardiomyopathy, and CHF with EF
20-25% who presents with erythema and swelling over AICD site.
It was difficult to obtain history as patient was very sleepy,
and information is gathered from chart and from limited patient
interaction. Patient states that approximately one week ago he
noticed swelling around AICD site, and over past week site has
become warm and painful. Pain occasionally radiates across chest
to the right, but no jaw pain, arm pain, SOB, palps. Does relate
fever, but unclear of onset. He presented to [**Hospital3 383**]
today and was found to have a fever to 104, o/w HD stable, with
erythema and warmth around AICD site. Given Invanz (Carbapenem)
1G IV, Vanc 1 g IV, and dilaudid and then developed runs of NSVT
(monomorphic, 16-20 beats per ED verbal, 10-15 per ED notes, [**4-10**]
per tele sent over from [**Hospital3 383**]) that broke on its own.
Patient was given lidocaine 100 mg IV, amiodarone 150 mg PO x 1
and started on amiodarone gtt. Transferred to [**Hospital1 22**] for further
management.
.
In ED patient was febrile to 101.9, HR 100, BP 110/70. His site
was noted to be erythematous and painful and was given
gentamycin loading dose of 430mg x 1 as well as dilaudid,
tylenol, and amiodarone gtt. 2 large bore IV's were placed and
patient sent to floor.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 38 year old male with CAD s/p CABG, pacer, AICD, CHF, who
presents with infection over AICD site.
.
# AICD INFECTION: His AICD was placed in [**2715-10-8**] for
non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.  He presented from OSH on [**12-18**]
with high grade MRSA bacteremia and infected AICD pocket.  ID
consult was called and he was put on vancomycin and gentamycin.
On [**12-20**], he had the AICD and all the wires removed.  His blood
cultures drawn from [**12-20**] to [**12-23**] were persistently positive
for MRSA.  While in the ICU, he remained hemodynamically stable.
 A temporary subclavian central catheter was placed for access
and was later discontinued.  A left PICC was placed on [**12-23**]
while still presumably bacteremic but he needed access.
Surveillance cultures from [**12-24**] onward finally became negative.
 His PICC was left in since he became afebrile and MRSA was no
longer growing in his blood.  Gentamycin was discontinued after
blood cultures remained negative x 72 hours.  He had a TTE on
admission that was negative for endocarditis or abcess but he
needed a TEE for a more definitely rule out.  However, he
persistently refused to have the TEE despite encouragement from
the primary team and the ID consult team.
.
On [**12-27**], he left the hospital against medical advice.  He was
being set up for VNA service and will get long term vancomycin
treatment (6 weeks) since he refused the TEE.  However, he
decided not to stay until the VNA was set up.  Eventually VNA
was scheduled and they will follow up at home.  He still had his
PICC when he left.
.
For followup, he needs to be seen at infectious disease clinic,
appointment made for him at discharge.  He also needs to follow
up at EP clinic since his AICD was removed.  For the pocket
wound, plastics surgery was consulted and they recommended wet
to dry dressings x 4 weeks with help from VNA.  Then he will
need primary closure.  Orthopaedic consult was called to assess
for possibly bone infection in the pocket area but this was
deemed unlikely.
.
# NSVT: He has had runs of NSVT on telemetry but is
asymptomatic.  He was started on amiodarone, loaded with 400mg
[**Hospital1 **] x 1 week and then 100mg daily therafter.  PFTs were done to
assess lung function pre-amiodarone: FVC 59%, FEV1 56%, FEV1/FVC
94%, suggesting baseline restrictive disease.  His TSH and LFTs
were normal.  He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at EP clinic.
.
# CAD: s/p CABG.  PMIBI in [**Month (only) **] showed no definite areas of
ischemia although there is global perfusion abnormalities.  EKG
did not suggest active ischemia and troponins were negative x 3.
 He continued asa + metoprolol + lisinopril + plavix + lipitor +
ezetimibe.
.
# CHF: echo on this admission shows EF of 15-20%.  He had signs
of overload on admission and was diursed in his MICU course.  He
continued metoprolol and lisinopril but lasix and spirinolactone
were held because he seemed euvolemic after adequate diureses
and his blood pressure was low-normal.
