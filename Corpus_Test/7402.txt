CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left BKA ischemia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79-year-old well known
to the vascular service recently admitted for workup of a
left BKA ischemia. She underwent anaphylaxis during planned
angiogram of the left axillofemoral bypass. This required
intubation in ICU with ventilatory support. She was
ultimately discharged to home on [**3159-9-11**] for
outpatient workup of her left stump ischemia. She returns
today, brought by her daughter, for concern of worsening
ischemia. She has used a new left leg prosthesis.
Subsequently has worse pain and "black stump." Denies fevers,
chills, rest pain, chest pain, shortness of breath or
abdominal pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Peripheral vascular disease, status
post right femoral peroneal bypass, status post common
femoral artery thrombectomy, status post left
axillobifemoral, status post profunda, status post left
ilioprofunda with PTFE, aortic insufficiency, history of
hypertension controlled, history of type 2 diabetes diet
controlled, coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction, status post CABG remote, history of
hypothyroidism on no supplement at this time.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes hysterectomy.

ALLERGIES:  KEFZOL causes anaphylaxis. SULFA causes
anaphylaxis, and ANGIO CONTRAST causes anaphylaxis.

MEDICATIONS:  Include Lopressor 50 mg b.i.d., nifedipine 50
mg XR daily, Isordil 30 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg daily,
Tylenol p.r.n., aspirin 325 mg daily, Lasix 40 mg b.i.d.,
Plavix 75 mg daily, Pletal 100 mg b.i.d., chlorpropamide 100
mg daily, Percocet p.r.n.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She denies alcohol, drug or tobacco use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: 99.8, 78, 14, blood
pressure of 114/53, oxygen saturation 96% on room air.
General appearance: This is a pleasant female in no acute
distress. HEENT exam is unremarkable. Chest is clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Heart has a regular rate and
rhythm. Abdominal exam is obese, nontender, nondistended.
Extremity exam shows left stump with slightly purpuric and
cool. Pulse exam shows palpable radials bilaterally. The
femoral on the right is 2+, popliteal is 2+, DP is
monophasic, PT is 1+. On the left; the femoral is 1+, the
popliteal is absent, and the axillary graft is biphasic.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially evaluated in the
emergency room. Vascular was consulted. The patient was
admitted to the vascular service for continued care. IV
heparinization was begun. On [**3159-9-17**] the patient
underwent a left axillary femoral jump graft to the profunda
femoris with [**Doctor Last Name 4660**]-Tex. The patient tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred to the PACU in stable condition. Her
admitting hematocrit was 31.6. Postoperative hematocrit was
24.2. She was transfused. BUN was 27. Creatinine was 0.1.
These remained unchanged. Her potassium was repleted.
Postoperatively, her dressings were clean, dry, and intact.
The stump was warm. The axillary graft was triphasic. The
patient continued to do well and then was transferred to the
VICU for continued monitoring and care. Her post transfusion
hematocrit was 36.4 after 2 units. Heparin drip was continued
and coumadinization was instituted. The patient was diuresed,
and she remained in the VICU.

On postoperative day 2, the patient continued to do well. IV
heparinization continued. Coumadinization was continued, and
her coagulation parameters were monitored and anticoagulant
dosing was adjusted. Physical therapy was requested to see
the patient in anticipation for discharge planning. Rehab was
their recommendation. Family and patient were adamantly
against this. The patient was reevaluated and felt that she
could be discharged with home PT.

On postoperative day 3, the patient's diet was advanced as
tolerated. T-max was 100.7 to 98.9. The patient had some
nausea. EKG was obtained which was negative for ischemic
changes. Beta blockade was increased.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The remaining hospital course was
unremarkable, and the patient was discharged to home on
postoperative day 6.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient's INR should be
monitored 3 times a week the initial. Goal INR is 2.0 to 2.5.
INR on [**9-22**] was 2.7. The patient did have some diarrhea
and was empirically started on Flagyl. The patient should
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks' time. The INR
results should be called to his office nurse; [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 26834**]. The patient may ambulate essential distances.
No heavy lifting. [**Month (only) 115**] take showers. No tub baths.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Isosorbide 30 mg t.i.d., atorvastatin
10 mg daily, aspirin 325 mg daily, Lasix 40 mg b.i.d., Plavix
75 mg daily, chlorpropamide 125 mg daily,
oxycodone/acetaminophen 5/325 tablets 1 to 2 q.6h. p.r.n.
(for pain), potassium and sodium phosphate packet 1 b.i.d.,
acetaminophen 325-mg tablets 1 to 2 q.4-6h., Lopressor 75 mg
b.i.d., Flagyl 500 mg t.i.d. for a total of 2 weeks, Coumadin
2.5 mg daily. Monitor INR. Goal of 2.0 to 2.5.
