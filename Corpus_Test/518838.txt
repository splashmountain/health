   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is
   mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
   There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45 %). The
   estimated cardiac index is borderline low (2.0-2.5L/min/m2). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
   normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
   There is moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild
   global hypokinesis and boderline low cardiac index. Moderate mitral
   regurgitation. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate to
   severe pulmonary hypertension.
   Assessment and Plan
   90M h/o HTN, hypercholesterolemia, Afib, h/o colon CA s/p colectomy,
   recent upper GI bleed presents with acute blood loss anemia and NSTEMI.
   .
   # Acute blood loss anemia:
   Recent identification of duodenal ulcer treated with PPI (no biopsy/H.
   pylori performed), now here with guaiac positive stool and continued
   melena.  EGD without obvious source of bleeding.  Likely small bowel
   source.  Cannot get SBFT on wknd.  Will get capsule study on Tuesday.
   Otherwise, vitals are stable.  Did receive 1 unit PRBCs last night for
   hct<30.
   - maintain 2 large bore IVs at all times
   - typed and crossed
   - transfuse to Hct>30 given cardiac ischemia
   - PO bid ppi
   - clear diet
   - consider H. pylori testing pending
   .
   # NSTEMI
   Likely remote demand event due to acute anemia, rather than unstable
   plaque, as normal CK and positive troponin. Cardiology with no plans
   for cath.  CK / MB flat.
   - no anticoagulation given recent GIB: hold asa + coumadin
   - transfuse to Hct>30
   - cont hold antihypertensives w/ ongoing melanotic stool
   - continue statin
   .
   # Afib:
   Well-controlled of meds.  Telemetry.  Previously on anticoagulation,
   being held w/ gi bleeding.
   .
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive, hold ACEi + BB for now in
   setting of acute GI bleed.
   .
   # Renal failure:
   Trending down w/ fluids, blood.
   Unclear if now at baseline.
   Cont trend + hold lasix/ACEi
