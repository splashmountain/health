   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo female with severe diastolic CHF, pulm HTN, afib, ulcerative
   colitis, and recent lower GI bleed p/w acute dyspnea and hypoxia,
   hypotensive on pressors who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Patient with severe diastolic heart failure, severe
   TR admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia. She describes an acute onset which
   raises concern for an inciting event. Pt w/ leukocytosis but no fevers,
   cough, or clear consolidation suggestive of pneumonia.  Pt in chronic
   afib but rate controlled.  No CP to suggest ACS; EKG baseline and 2
   sets CE neg. PE possible but no CP, tachycardia (on beta blocker), or
   hemoptysis; she does have chronic LLE edema, now ?L>R (same leg as
   hematoma). Question component of reactive airways disease given earlier
   response to albuterol although no h/o COPD and no wheezes on exam
   currently.  Thyroid dysfunction unlikely to provoke acute
   decompensation.  Per daughter, sx may have been worsening over the past
   week already; there may be a component of suboptimal dietary/med
   compliance in this pt with baseline dCHF that has been very difficult
   to manage.
   - lasix gtt and if not sufficient diuresis consider ultrafiltration
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - maintain levophed as necessary while diuresing
   - Will transition back to home spironolactone, torsemide, and
   metolazone as able
   - Nebulizers prn
   - Consider repeat TTE
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] notified of admission; he will stop by today; suggests
   possible need for ultrafiltration
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely cardiogenic in setting of worsening dCHF. Pt
   does have known colitis with guaiac positive stools and planned for
   outpatient scoping; stable Hct suggests that this is more a slow
   bleed.  Pt with mild leukocytosis but no evidence of sepsis at this
   time. CVL placed. UA mildly inflammatory; culture pending.
   - Ciprofloxacin started [**4-17**] for empiric treatment of UTI
   - will maintain levophed for pressor support in setting of aggressive
   diuresis and attempt to wean as possible
   - Monitor temp curve, WBC for now
   .
   # Hematochezia: Recent admission for anemia; thought to have recurrent
   lower GI angioectasia bleeding.  Pt currently with guaiac positive dark
   stools but stable Hct since last discharge.  Most c/w LGIB again rather
   than UGIB.
   - Active T&S
   - Trend Hct [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - Cont home po PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6643**] notified
   .
   # Acute renal failure: BUN 100, Cr 2.5 (baseline 1.7) Likely decreased
   renal perfusion in setting of decompensated heart failure and
   hypotension. Did have ARF on last admission and was found to have urine
   eos on last admission and mesalamine initially held due to reports of
   AIN with this but restarted when stabilized; eventually thought more
   likely from prerenal azotemia.
   - FeNA = 5.8%, FeUN = 31%
   - Plan for diuresis as above
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1901**] notified; asked for renal consult to see pt this AM, and
   he will follow while in house
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Mild AST and Alk phos elevation; nl ALT and Tbili. No
   abd pain. Likely congestive hepatopathy.
   - Trend LFTs
   - Diuresis as above
   .
   # Nausea: [**Month (only) 56**] be related to uremia.  No evidence of gastroenteritis
   currently; abd benign.
   - Zofran prn
   - Monitor for now
   .
   # Afib: Stable with slow ventricular response; not anticoagulated
   secondary to GI bleeding
   - hold metoprolol for now in setting of hypotension  and pressor
   .
   # Ulcerative colitis: Does not seem to be in a UC flare, no increase in
   diarrhea, no abdominal cramping
   - Continue asacol 800mg tid
   .
   # H/o DM: Not on hypoglycemics.
   - Insulin sliding scale for now
   # Restless legs.
   - start home gabapentin
