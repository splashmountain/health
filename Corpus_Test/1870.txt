History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 10314**] is an 82 year-old female with a past medical history
significant for HTN, gastritis, and atrial fibrillation,
transferred from an outside hospital with hypotension and
bradycardia. Per report, the patient was found by her daughter
at home with coffee-ground emesis (per EMS) last night around
21:30, pale. By the daughter's account, Ms. [**Known patient lastname 10314**] was mentating
well.

She was taken to [**Hospital **] Hospital, where she was found to have
HR in 30s and SBP in 70s. IVFs X 2 liters were administered
without improvement. She was subsequently given Atropine and
started on a Dopamine drip. Per report, she subsequently
developed worsening respiratory distress and was intubated.
Dopamine was titrated up with eventual conversion to NSR with
rate in 70s and SBP>100. Gastric lavage was negative.

By the family's account, Ms. [**Known patient lastname 10314**] has had frequent dizzy
spells at night, leading to changes in her BP meds dosing
schedule. No recent history of F/C/CP/SOB.

At [**Hospital1 **],she was given Vecuronium 2mg IV, Lidocaine 100 mg
IV, Succinylcholine 100 mg IV, Atropine 1 mg X 2, Ativan 2 mg,
Zantac 50 mg, Zofran 4 mg, Dopamine up to 20 mcg/min, NS 2
liters.

EKG:
22:15 34 bpm, junctional rhythm, no ST-T changes.
02:00 46 bpm junctional rhythm, normal axis, peaked T waves.
02:33 NSR 76 bpm, normal axis, normal QRS+ QTc, primary AV
block. No ST-T changes.

CXR [**2812-1-26**]: Endotracheal tube, central venous catheter, and
nasogastric tube are in place. Cardiac and mediastinal contours
are within normal limits. There are multifocal patchy areas of
increased opacity in the right mid and left lower lung zones,
with otherwise grossly clear lungs. No pleural effusions are
identified.

IMPRESSION: Patchy right mid and left lower lung zone opacities,
which may relate to patchy atelectasis, aspiration, or early
infection. Followup radiographs suggested.

ECHO [**2812-1-26**]: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2812-1-28**] CXR: There is interval placement of a dual-chamber
pacemaker with the leads in the right ventricle and right
atrium. There is also an NG tube with the tip coiled extending
beyond the limits of the radiograph in the stomach. The cardiac,
mediastinal, and hilar contours are unchanged. The patient was
extubated. There are persistent perihilar opacities that most
likely reprsent atelectasis. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Dual-chamber pacemaker with the leads in the right
atrium and right ventricle.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 year-old female with a PMHx significant for HTN on multiple
out-patient antihypertensives, atrial fibrillation now off
Coumadin X 2 months, admitted with bradycardia and hypotension,
as well as respiratory failure requiring intubation. Her
hospital course will be reviewed by problems.

1) Bradycardia/hypotension: She was admitted to the CCU for
management. Per report, her HR and BP eventually responded to
Dopamine and Atropine at the outside hospital. The etiology of
her bradycardic and hypotensive event was somewhat unclear on
admission. Cardiac enzymes were negative X 3, TSH normal. An
echo was performed on [**2812-1-26**], which revealed normal EF, no
abnormalities. Her bradycardia was eventually felt to be most
likely medication-induced. In the CCU, however, she had
recurrent bradycardia and hypotension when Dopamine was weaned,
and she underwent PPM placement on [**2812-1-27**]. She tolerated the
procedure well. Amiodarone and Lopressor were resumed post
procedure. On [**2812-1-27**] at night, she went into atrial
fibrillation, with spontaneous conversion 12 hours later.
Amiodarone was increased to 400 mg PO BID for 3 days, and she is
to be discharged on 200 mg PO QD. No anticoagulation since she
is at high fall risk. On discharge, her blood pressure
medication include lopressor, lipitor, hydrochlorothiazide and
Diovan.

2) ID: Ms. [**Known patient lastname 10314**] was hypothermic on admission, poorly
responsive, and acidotic. A CXR was initially suspicious for RML
and RLL pneumonia, and she was started on Azithromycin and
Ceftriaxone. Cultures were sent. Her cultures eventually grew
E.coli in the urine, resistant to Ampicillin, Ciprofloxacin,
Piperacillin and Bactrim. Her sputum cultures also grew E.coli,
pansensitive. Hence, Azithromycin was D/C'd, and she was
continued on Ceftriaxone for coverage of both, with plan to
change to Cefpodoxime prior to discharge. She will complete a
10-day course of antibiotics. Of note, a repeat PA/lateral was
negative for pneumonia.

3) Respiratory failure: She was extubated following pacemaker
placement, and did well post-extubation.

4) FEN/Renal: Ms. [**Known patient lastname 10314**] had a metabolic acidosis on admission
due to lactic acidosis, ARF (peak creatinine [**12-7**] on admission),
and elevated LFT's felt secondary to hypoperfusion in the
setting of drug-induced bradycardia. Her metabolic acidosis
quickly resolved with resolution of the renal failure and
improved hemodynamics.

5) Anemia: Her Hct dropped to a nadir of 27.3 on [**2812-1-28**], and
she was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs with appropriate Hct
response. Of note, she was likely hemoconcentrated on admission.
Stools and NG output guaiac negative. Hemolysis work-up also
negative. Further work-up will be left to the out-patient
setting.
