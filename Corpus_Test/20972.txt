History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known patient lastname 33702**] is a 62yoF with h/o PAF on coumadin, CVA, HTN, HLD,
who presents with chest pain, afib with RVR, and elevated
troponin. [**Known patient lastname 11387**] started on [**3465-4-6**], when she was riding in a
car as passenger and suddenly developed [**9-1**] substernal chest
pain with diaphoresis. Lasted 5 minutes then gradually resolved.
NO SOB or palpitations. For the next day she felt some residual
pressure feeling that was constant and did not vary with
activity. Today she is pain free x24 hours. She waited to be
seen because she was visiting on [**Location (un) 1912**] at the time and
returned today. She notes she has had this type of pain before
when has developed afib. Pain was never this severe and never
had diaphoresis previously. Denies SOB, n/v. Had been in NSR on
[**3465-2-14**] at last cardiology appointment.
.
She initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 18**], where vitals were T97.9
HR: 147 BP: 134/99 Resp: 18 O(2)Sat: 100 Normal. INR 2.6,
troponin(t) 0.746. D-dimer was checked and was negative. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 68**] for further care
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.3 110 114/86 16 99%
Labs and imaging significant for CXR which showed clear lungs
fields with some vascular fullness.

Studies
TTE [**3465-4-14**]: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium, the body of the right atrium, or the right
atrial appendage. Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast
is present in the left atrial appendage. LV systolic function
appears depressed. Right ventircular systolic function is normal
with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened with miild (1+) aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate/severe SEC in the LAA. No thrombus
identified. Depressed LV sytolic function. Mild aortic
regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**3465-4-10**],
the findings are similar.

Cardiac MRI [**3465-4-13**]:
1. Normal size and orientation of the pulmonary veins without
CMR evidence of anomalous pulmonary venous return or pulmonary
vein stenosis.
2. Normal left ventricular cavity size with severe hypokinesis
to akinesis of the basal to mid inferior wall and akinesis of
the true apex. The LVEF was moderately depressed at 33%. Late
gadolinium contrast-enhanced CMR images demonstrated patchy
transmural late gadolinium hyperenhancement of the basal to mid
inferior wall and true apex, sparing a small segment of the
distal inferior wall. The findings are consistent with poor
(<20%) likelihood of functional recovery of these walls after
mechanical revascularization.
3. Normal right ventricular cavity size with mild free wall
hypokinesis. The RVEF was mildly depressed at 37%.
4. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending
thoracic aorta were mildly increased and normal respectively.
The indexed diameter of the main pulmonary artery was moderately
dilated.
5. Mild biatrial enlargement.
6. A note is made of multiple T2 hyperintense lesions in the
liver measuring up to 3.6 x 3.0 cm in the hepatic dome (201:15)
which are incompletely characterized however most likely
represent simple cysts. Multiple sub- centimeter simple cysts
are noted in the left kidney

CXR [**4-14**]:
Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison
to [**3465-4-8**].
Cardiomegaly is moderate, unchanged. Mediastinum is
unremarkable. Lungs are essentially clear. No pleural effusion
or pneumothorax is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known patient lastname 33702**] is a 62yoF with h/o PAF on coumadin, CVA, HTN, HLD,
who presents with chest pain, afib with RVR, and elevated
troponin.
.
# Chest pain/NSTEMI: Troponin(t) elevated to 0.7 at [**Location (un) 18**], up
to 0.87 at [**Hospital1 68**]. EKG showed lateral TWI and some non-specific
ST changes. Cardiac cath on [**4-11**] showed 40% LAD disease. Thus,
likely rapid Afib was the primary problem, and this caused some
degree of stress cardiomyopathy and demand ischemia. It was also
possible that this was due to an MI that spontaneously cleared.
PE was ruled out with negative D-dimer at OSH. TTE showed focal
wall motion abnormality (though not congruous with LAD lesion)
and new decrease in EF (45%). The patient remained
anticoagulated on coumadin. No Plavix was started, but aspirin
was increased to 325mg daily. Cholesterol panel out of range
(per below), last A1c [**3462**] 5.6%
.
# Atrial fibrillation / sick sinus syndrome: She went in and out
of rapid afib and sinus bradycardia during this admission,
consistent with sick sinus syndrome. TSH on [**3465-1-25**] of 1.7. She
was initially anti-coagulated with heparin gtt and coumadin. On
[**4-13**] she had a cardiac MRI for staging for a planned pulmonary
vein isolation procedure. On [**4-14**] she went for PVI, but it was
complicated by oropharnygeal bleeding [**2-23**] TEE probe, and she
went to the CCU. The PVI was otherwise successful. In the CCU
she was intubated for airway protection and briefly on pressors.
She was extubated and off pressors within hours. She was doing
well and called out to the floor in stable condition, without
any more bleeding. Nodal agents were held given her tendency to
be in sinus bradycardia when not in atrial fibrillation.   On
[**4-16**] she had an episode of rapid Afib that responded to
dronadarone and ranolazine.  On [**4-17**] her QTc found to be
prolonged, therefore dronadarone was d/c.
.
# PUMP: TTE 1 year ago with normal function, now with EF 45% and
wall motion abnormality. Euvolemic on exam. Will need repeat TTE
in future to assess myocardial recovery after this acute event.
.
# Prolonged QTc: Went from 0.4 to 0.53s afer quinidine given on
[**4-11**]. Once off quinidine, QTc back to 0.4ms.  Prolonged again
after starting dronadarone [**4-16**], so this drug was d/c [**4-17**] prior
to discharge.
.
# Oropharyngeal injury:  The patient suffered OP injury during
intubation for PVI. Resistance was met in the pharynx while
attempting to place the TEE probe, and no attempt was made to
place the probe further into the esophagus.  The temperature
probe was also noted to be displaced. Mild oozing was noted, and
the pharynx was packed with good effect.  The patient was
followed by ENT who recommended gastrograffin study to
investigate possible injury.  Discussed with EP attending of
record who did not feel swallowing study was necessary.  The
patient's diet was advanced without complication.  The patient
was d/c with ENT follow-up to ensure pharyngeal healing.
.
# Urinary tract infection: [**Month (only) 496**] have contributed to sympathetic
tone and helped create afib w/ RVR. Completed 3 day course of
Macrobid, UA cleared and patient became asymptomatic.
.
# GERD: Continued home omeprazole 40mg daily. Of note, her
"GERD" [**Month (only) **] are occuring only when she is in rapid afib, so
she may not have GERD but rather symptomatic arrhythmia. If
[**Month (only) **] resolve after PVI, would consider decreased PPI or
stopping it all together and trying an H2 blocker in the future
.
# Hyperlipidemia: On simvastatin at home, changed to
atorvastatin this admission. Last chol panel: [**3465-1-26**]: total 181,
trig 113, HDL 47, LDL 106. Goal LDL < 70.
.
# Osteopenia: continued calcium

=========================================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- [**Doctor Last Name 852**] of Hearts monitor started prior to discharge for planned
2 week monitoring; results to be reviewed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
- ENT follow-up to assess pharyngeal healing
- INR supratherapeutic during admission, warfarin dose reduced;
this will require further adjustment
- Dronadarone was d/c due to prolonged QTc, please continue to
monitor QTc on discharge
- If GERD [**Last Name (STitle) **] resolve, consider stopping PPI or switching
to H2 blocker

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mrs [**Known patient lastname 33702**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 68**]. You were admitted
for chest pain and atrial fibrillation. You had a cardiac
catheterization, which showed no major blockages in your heart's
arteries. We did find reduced function in your heart, likely
from a rapid heart rate due to the atrial fibrillation. You had
a pulmonary vein isolation procedure, which should prevent you
from going into atrial fibrillation in the future. During your
procedure the back of your mouth was bruised.  Our ENT team was
consulted and will see you after discharge to ensure your
healing.

The following changes were made to your medications
** STOP propranolol
** STOP simvastatin
** START atorvastatin
** START aspirin
** START ranolazine
** CHANGE warfarin dose, as your INR was high
