[**2679-12-25**] without complication.  The patient was sent to the
ICU postoperatively for close monitoring, being additionally
maintained on Neo, insulin, Esmolol, and propofol drips.
Abdominal distention prompted placement of a NG tube with a
copious return.  The patient was tachycardiac on
postoperative day number two which prompted Swan placement.
He was extubated on postoperative day number two.

The patient had clinical signs of respiratory difficulty on
postoperative day number three with wheezing, shortness of
breath, and mild diaphoresis.  There were no desaturation
episodes or changes in respiration rate.  The patient was
subsequently transferred to the floor where he continued to
have intermittent episodes of respiratory difficulty which
resolved with aggressive pulmonary toilet and nebulizer
treatments of Albuterol and Atrovent.

A mild amount of fibrinous drainage was seen to be draining
from the sternal wound but this stopped on postoperative day
number six with no further event.

The patient was discharged to rehabilitation on postoperative
day number nine, having done well with physical therapy, and
adequate pain control on pain medications and tolerating a
regular diet.
