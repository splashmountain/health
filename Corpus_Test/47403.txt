ADDENDUM:  This is a Discharge Summary addendum.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:  (Following transfer to Medicine
Service)

1.  PULMONARY SYSTEM:  Once the patient's cardiac condition
was stabilized, as discussed in the previous attached
Discharge Summary, the patient was transferred from the
Coronary Care Unit to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

On [**12-16**], the patient self-extubated requiring
reintubation by Anesthesia.  As before, the intubation was
extremely difficult and again required fiberoptic
bronchoscopy for airway visualization due to severe laryngeal
edema.  Sedation was weaned, and he was consented for
tracheostomy.  He was given a trial of pressure-support
ventilation and did better than expected and was extubated
successfully on [**12-20**].  Although secretions were
tenacious and required aggressive suctioning, it was
ultimately felt that he would not require a tracheostomy.

On [**12-21**], a chest x-ray showed right lung collapse;
consistent with mucus plug.  The patient spontaneously
coughed up a large amount of mucous,and a follow-up chest
x-ray demonstrated re-expansion of the right lung.  A similar
episode occurred on [**12-23**]; and the patient required
aggressive suctioning to achieve re-expansion of the right
lung.

Following this, the patient's pulmonary status improved
steadily; with oxygen saturations ranging from 92% on 4
liters to 95% on room air.  Respiratory therapists provided
suctioning every four hours with a continued improvement;
although, the patient's secretions remained thick and copious
at the time of this dictation.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient completed a 2-week
course of levofloxacin and metronidazole for a right lower
lobe pneumonia; presumed due to aspiration.

Sputum cultures grew only oropharyngeal flora.  Blood
cultures from [**12-12**] were negative.  Additionally, the
patient developed a symptomatic leukocytosis to 27,000 on
[**12-23**].  Blood cultures were therefore sent on [**12-24**], and these were sterile at the time of discharge.

3.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient was continued on
atorvastatin, Lopressor, and captopril.  At the time of
discharge, captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. was switched to
lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d. for ease of dosing.

Given the patient's depressed ejection fraction of 35%, both
the Lopressor and lisinopril may be titrated up as an
outpatient as blood pressure allows.  As the echocardiogram
on [**12-11**] showed a depressed ejection fraction with
apical akinesis, anticoagulation with heparin was given in
order to prevent left ventricular thrombus formation.  Once
it was decided not to proceed with tracheostomy, warfarin was
started on [**12-23**].

A follow-up echocardiogram was obtained on [**12-24**].  This
revealed a mildly dilated left atrium, a normal left
ventricular cavity size, with overall left ventricular
systolic function moderately depressed, with an ejection
fraction of 35%.  There was distal, septal, and apical
akinesis.  Posterior hypokinesis was present.  Basal septum
and lateral walls were somewhat preserved.  The aortic valve
and mitral valve leaflets were both mildly thickened.

To help with the decision about chronic anticoagulation for
left ventricular thrombosis prophylaxis, the Cardiology
Service was consulted.  Based on the presence of a mild left
ventricular aneurysm, as well as the depressed ejection
fraction, they recommended three months of anticoagulation
with warfarin (with a goal INR of 2 to 3).  During this time,
aspirin should be held; and it can be restarted after the
three month period of anticoagulation with warfarin.
Finally, they recommended a follow-up echocardiogram in three
months with consideration for implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator placement if the ejection fraction
is less than 30%.

4.  NUTRITION:  ProMod with fiber was provided via the
patient's gastrojejunostomy tube at 75 cc per hour.  The
Swallowing Service evaluated the patient and found that he
grossly aspirated with even small amounts of custard.  They
recommended to keep the patient nothing by mouth, continue
tube feeds, and re-evaluate in the future to see if
swallowing function recovers.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to [**Hospital3 31548**].

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Atrovent nebulizer q.6h.
 2.  Albuterol nebulizer q.2-3h. as needed.
 3.  Colace liquid 100 mg per gastrojejunostomy tube b.i.d.
 4.  Dulcolax 10 mg p.r. or per gastrojejunostomy tube q.d.
as needed.
 5.  Lactulose 30 mL per gastrojejunostomy tube q.8h. as
needed.
 6.  Lisinopril 10 mg per gastrojejunostomy tube q.d. (hold
for a systolic blood pressure of less than 100).
 7.  Lipitor 20 mg per gastrojejunostomy tube q.d.
 8.  Metoprolol 12.5 mg per gastrojejunostomy tube b.i.d.
(hold for a systolic blood pressure of less than 110 or a
heart rate of less than 60).
 9.  Warfarin 5 mg per gastrojejunostomy tube q.h.s.
10.  Ranitidine 150 mg per gastrojejunostomy tube b.i.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Inferior wall myocardial infarction.
2.  Left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
3.  Left ventricular aneurysm; mild.
4.  Right lower lobe pneumonia secondary to aspiration.
5.  Prolonged wean from mechanical ventilation.
6.  Dysphagia; likely secondary to prolonged mechanical
ventilation.
