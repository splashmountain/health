Service:  Blue Surgery
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 49-year-old
African-American female who underwent a sigmoid colectomy in
[**3202-10-2**] for adenocarcinoma of the colon with one
positive lymph node.  She also received chemotherapy
adjunctive to the surgery of 5FU and leucovorin.  She has had
[**3203-12-31**].  A CT scan of the abdomen was performed on
[**3204-1-2**], which demonstrated two lesions in the
liver, a 3.2 cm lesion in segment for a 4.3 x 2.5 cm lesion
in the inferior aspect of the right lobe near the liver edge.
She was then referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for consideration of
hepatic resection for this metastatic disease to the liver.

1. Hypertension.
2. Atrial fibrillation.
3. Congestive heart failure.
4. IHSS status post pacemaker placement DDD in [**3196**].
5. Colon adenocarcinoma with positive lymph node and status
post surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy.
6. Sleep apnea.
7. Diabetes.

Past surgical history is significant for status post sigmoid
colectomy in [**3191**] and status post brain tumor resection in
[**3184**], status post uvulectomy and sinus surgery.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Coumadin 2.5 mg po taken as
directed, verapamil HCL 180 mg po q day, triazolam 25 mg po q
hs prn, ranitidine 150 mg po bid, Micro-K 20 mEq q am,
lactulose two tablespoons [**Hospital1 **], hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg po q
day, Glyburide 5 mg po q day, Glucophage 1000 mg po bid,
Flonase one spray each nostril q day, Diovan 80 mg po q day,
atenolol 50 mg po q day, [**Doctor First Name 2238**] 60 mg po bid prn.

ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to sulfa and penicillin which
cause rash.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She denies any alcohol or smoking history.
No history of IV drug use.

Family history is significant for a mother who died of
cerebrovascular accident.  Her father died of a myocardial
infarction and question of IHSS at age 45.  Sister died at
age 47 of a myocardial infarction and question of IHSS.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient is moderately obese female in
no acute distress.  Temperature is 99.0, pulse 84.  Blood
pressure is 140/84, respirations 20, and weight is 246 lb.
Skin has keloids under both mandibles and several scars on
the torso.  HEENT:  No scleral icterus.  Oropharynx is clear.
No uvula.  Neck is supple.  No lymphadenopathy and no
thyromegaly.  Lungs are clear to auscultation.  Cardiac
examination is normal, S1 loud, split S2, there is a 3/6
systolic ejection murmur along the left sternal border.
Regular, rate, and rhythm with pacemaker.  Abdomen is soft,
nontender, normal bowel sounds, and no masses.  Extremities
have no peripheral edema.  Neurologically she is intact.

LABORATORIES:  Hemoglobin 12.6, hematocrit 37.7, white count
of 12.3, platelets 176,000.  Sodium 139, potassium 4.5,
chloride 102, bicarbonate 23, glucose of 305, BUN of 12,
creatinine of 0.7, AST of 17, ALT of 27, alkaline phosphatase
of 88, total bilirubin of 0.2, direct bilirubin of 0.1, CEA
of 34.

She underwent a cardiac catheterization by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 853**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 30988**],
which is only significant for an elevated pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure of 18-20, but her coronary arteries were open,
which is a moderate surgical risk.

Electrocardiogram showed paced rhythm with a rate of 78.

CTA showed one liver lesion in segment six of the right lobe
measuring 2.7 x 5.2 cm.  Second lesion in segment 4A
measuring 3.8 x 4.6 cm.  There are two additional low
attenuation foci.  They were too small to characterize.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the date of admission, the patient was
taken to the operating room where she underwent a segment six
and segment 4B resection, cholecystectomy, and intraoperative
ultrasound.  She tolerated this procedure well and received
3,000 Crystalloid and estimated blood loss of 400 and urine
output of 640.  She was transferred to the PACU in stable
condition.

She spent the first postoperative night in the Intensive Care
Unit for close monitoring where she remained hemodynamically
stable, and postoperative day #1, she was transferred to the
floor for remainder of recovery.  Neurologically her pain was
controlled with epidural for the first postoperative day.
The epidural was discontinued and patient was placed on IV
Morphine prn.  Her pain has appropriately decreased and her
use of pain medications has appropriately decreased.  She has
remained alert and oriented, and neurologically intact.
Respiratory status has remained stable.  Her O2 saturations
have been in the high 90s to 100%, and has been weaned off
oxygen successfully.

Cardiovascular status has remained stable.  She is remaining
hemodynamically stable.  She did have an episode on
postoperative day #3 where she described a "her throat was
closing."  Due to the history of diabetes, it is unknown if
this was an atypical chest pain versus perhaps some laryngeal
edema secondary to intubation.  She had an electrocardiogram
which showed paced rhythm which was unchanged from a previous
electrocardiogram.  She also had a set of cardiac enzymes
sent which were negative with a troponin less than 0.3, CPK
of 639, MB fraction of 1.

She had one other episode, but has denied having any other
episodes of her throat closing.  Much of her symptoms have
been focused only around her airway.  During this period also
she did not have any periods of desaturation and remained
hemodynamically stable.

Her diet was advanced to a diabetic diet which she has been
tolerating.  Her wound has remained clean, dry, and intact.
Her JP has continued to drain moderate amounts up to 50
cc/day of a darkly colored fluid.  She will be discharged
with a JP in place with followup in clinic for evaluation and
then possible removal.  Her Foley was discontinued.  She has
been voiding without any problems.

Endocrine wise, the patient's blood glucose levels have
remained in the 200s ranging anywhere from as low as 172 to
as high as 288.  Josalin consult was obtained and patient was
recommended to be started on insulin injections for better
hyperglycemic control.  She was placed on NPH insulin 16
units in the morning and 12 units before bedtime in an
adjusted sliding scale.  She received diabetic teaching while
in the hospital.  She will be going home with VNA for
injections of NPH in the morning and in the evening.  Will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30989**] in the [**Hospital 30990**] Clinic on Monday,
[**3204-2-23**].  She was restarted on oral hypoglycemic medication
once she was taken off the diabetic diet.

Hematologically, the patient's hematocrit has remained
stable.  Has gone from 29 to 25.  Her platelet count had
dropped down to 105 on postoperative day two from 151 on
postoperative day #0.  Her Zantac was stopped.  She is placed
on Protonix for gastrointestinal prophylaxis.  Her Heparin
injections were continued and antibody was sent to the
laboratory.

The patient has been ambulating, stable, and ready for
discharge with followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**3204-2-25**] in the
clinic.  Pathology has returned on the specimen with negative
margins 0.9 cm.  The section 6 and 4 resection were positive
for metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon.

[**Last Name (STitle) 30989**] on [**2-23**] and followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2-25**].
