.
Imaging:
[**2628-11-23**]-CT abd:
1. Evidence of acute sigmoid diverticulitis. There is small free
fluid in the cul-de-sac, which was not previously present. No
free air is noted.
2. No change in appearance of known AAA.
.
CXR [**2628-12-1**]:IMPRESSION:
Bibasilar atelectasis, borderline cardiac enlargement, otherwise
unremarkable study.
.
CTA chest/abd/pelvis [**2628-12-1**]-wet read- No dissection. Stable
AAA.
Interval improvement in sigmoid diverticulitis. No abscess.
Bibasilar atelectasis. Prominent pancreatic duct measuring up to
3 mm which may be within normal limits given patient age.
.
ECHO [**2628-11-11**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF
70-80%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is moderate to severe aortic valve
stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Labs on discharge:
***************


Brief Hospital Course:
#Hypotension: Thought to be related to poor PO intake after
recent episode of diverticulitis and restarting
antihypertensives.  Other etiologies: sepsis, hypovolemia from
acute bleed. In terms of hypovolemia, pt hypotensive in ED to
80's and given a total of 4L IVF - never required pressors.
Baseline HCT 26-30, was down to 24 after IVF. CTA report is
stable AAA, no acute bleed, but stool brown and guiac positive
in ED. Transfused 1 U upon arrival, and Hct remained stable
overnight and repeat guaiac was negative. After being called out
to the floor, the patient remained normotensive and home BP meds
were restarted gradually.
.
# Abdominal pain: Most likely persistant diverticulitis as
above. Scans actually show interval improvement in
diverticulitis, pancreatic enzymes normal, LFT's normal.
Continued antibiotics as below.  GI was consulted and performed
EGD for concern for GI bleed, that only showed gastritis.
Colonoscopy was deferred to the outpatient setting given her
recent diverticulitis and bacteremia. The patient's pain had
resolved by the time she left the ICU and she remained symptom
free throughout remainder of hospital course.
.
# Bacteremia: 1 blood culture bottle grew Viridans strep. She
had no other clear signs of endocarditis. She had a TTE that was
of suboptimal quality and did not show any evidence of
vegetations. She had a TEE that was negative. She was discharged
on ceftriaxone to complete a 2 week course of antibiotics.
.
# Anemia:  Baseline HCT 26-30. 29.7 on admit, as low as 21 after
IVF. Recent iron studies show anemia of chronic disease.
Transfused 1U and Hct stablized throughout remainder of hospital
course.  GI work up included EGD as above that only showed
gastritis, colonoscopy was deferred to outpatient in setting of
diverticulitis/bacteremia.  ASA was restarted during hospital
course.
.
# Hypertension:  Home metoprolol, HCTZ, and [**Last Name (un) **] held in the
setting of hypotension. BP was stable with the re-initiation of
metoprolol alone.
.
# Hyperlipidemia:  continued statin.
.
# Aortic Stenosis:  valve area 0.8cm per last cath.  On TEE, 0.8
cm but peak gradient 97 mm Hg.  Will need follow up with her
cardiologist as outpatient.
.
# AV nodal disease:  s/p pacemaker implantation. Stable during
hospital course.
.
# AAA:  known, stable on CT.
