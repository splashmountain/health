52M with stage T3 esophageal cancer s/p chemo/XRT, with marked
diminuition of the primary tumor, presented [**7-5**] for elective
resection of the tumor.  His symptoms included marked dysphagia,

Pertinent Results:
[**8-12**] CXR: Small pleural effusions continue to resolve. The
diffuse infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has not improved,
although its heterogeneous texture suggest the development of
interstitial pulmonary emphysema. There is no pneumomediastinum
or pneumothorax. Heart is normal sized. Tracheostomy tube and
right internal jugular and right subclavian venous catheters are
in standard placement, unchanged. A drain projects over the
thoracic inlet to the left of midline.

[**7-24**] CT chest: No evidence of pulmonary embolism. Extensive
bilateral interstitial and ground glass opacities, most
pronounced in the bases, which could be consistent with acute
atypical pneumonia, pulmonary edema versus ARDS.

[**7-22**] UGIS: No evidence of leakage at the anastomotic site.
Initial delay in contrast emptying at pylorus but filling of
duodenum was subsequently demonstrated.

[**7-12**] CXR: Bilateral small pneumothoraces; Dilatation of the
stomach, which is fluid filled. New asymmetric consolidations in
the lungs (left > right).

[**7-10**] UGIS: No evidence of leak at the anastomotic site.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**7-5**] Admitted to colorectal surgery service following
uncomplicated esophagogastrectomy.
[**7-6**] Extubated
[**7-7**] Transferred to floor
[**7-8**] APS consult: dilaudid PCA
[**7-10**]: negative swallow study.  Started on clears
[**7-11**]: Desaturation & increasing O2 requirements.  CXR showed
markedly distended gastric bubble & bilateral infiltrates
[**7-12**]: Taken to OR for replacement of NGT under direct
visualization, and readmitted to SICU
[**7-13**]: Developed rapid atrial fibrillation requiring electrical
cardioversion.  Cardiac enzymes & echo neg
[**7-22**]: Repeat barium swallow negative.  Given sips of clears
[**7-23**]: Transferred to floor in good condition after tolerating
PO's without complication
[**7-24**]: Transferred to TSICU after developing respiratory distress
(pO2 48)
[**7-26**]: Reintubated for bronchoscopy
[**7-29**]: cardioverted for rapid a fib
[**7-31**]: started steroid pulse for empiric treatment for pulmonary
fibrosis
[**8-2**]: cardioverted for rapid a fib
[**8-6**]: percutaneous tracheostomy
[**8-7**]: cardioverted for rapid a fib

NEURO: Acute on chronic pain issues.  Currently treated with
methadone, clonidine & prn ativan
CV: intermittent rapid A fib, requiring cardioversion because of
recalcitrant hypotension.  followed by cardiology.  rate
controlled with lopressor & digoxin.  anticoagulated with
coumadin (INR 2-2.5) & aspirin.  avoiding amiodarone due to
pulmonary issues.
RESP: severe respiratory failure, presumably from pulmonary
fibrosis (etiology aspiration pneumonitis vs amio toxicity vs
occult infection)
FEN/GI: sustained by tube feeds & on meds via LUQ J tube.  lyte
repletion.  prevacid for GI prophylaxis.
HEME: hct stable on coumadin 7.5qd.  check at least biweekly INR
& adjust coumadin doses accordingly (goal 2-2.5).
