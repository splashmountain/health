Chief Complaint:  Pleurisy
   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 3774**] is a 56 yo M with a history of hemachromatosis c/b CVA [**50**]
   year ago with no residual deficits, who presented to the ED today
   complaining of several days of left sided chest pain that is worse with
   inspiration. The pain is sharp and nonradiating and is worse with
   sitting up. It's constant. He also complains of shortness of breath,
   but he feels this is because it was very painful to breath at all. He
   has a cough productive of brown sputum. He admitted to vomiting earlier
   in the week. He has had decreased appetite and poor PO intake for the
   last 2 days.  He denies f/c, n/d, diaphoresis, palpitations.
   .
   In the ED, the patient's VS were 97.3, 101, 130/83 satting 95%6L nc. He
   underwent CTA to r/o PE, which was negative, but showed a dense LLL
   pna. His labs were notable for a leukocytosis to 14,000 with 22 bands,
   a creatinine of 1.7, and a lactate of 3.5. He was given 3L NS and a
   dose of levofloxacin 750mg x 1. He also received morphine, toradol and
   dilaudid for pain control. Lactate improved to 2.5 with IVF. Cardiac
   enzymes were negative and EKG was without ischemic changes.
   .
   On the floor, the patient's pain was much better controlled. He denied
   shortness of breath, fevers/chills. He noted that as long as his pain
   was controlled, his breathing felt comfortable. He felt very thirsty.
   Shortly after arrival to the floor the patient triggered for
   tachycardia to 150 while attempting to give a sputum sample.  Telemetry
   monitoring showed a narrow complex tachycardia with p waves present
   that lasted for about 6 minutes.  His tachycardia broke with a valsalva
   maneuver and his heart rate returned to the 90s.  He was transfered to
   the ICU for closer monitoring.

   Imaging: CXR: FINDINGS: There is a focus of dense consolidation in the
   left lower lobe. The right lung is clear. The cardiomediastinal
   silhouette is unremarkable. CONCLUSION: Dense pneumonic consolidation
   in the left lower lobe. Please ensure followup to clearance.
   .
   CTA: CONCLUSION:
   1. Dense pneumonic consolidation involving most of the left lower lobe,
   please ensure followup to clearance.
   2. Up to 4 mm scattered pulmonary nodules in the right lower lobe
   should be  followed up with a chest CT in six months if the patient is
   at high risk of cancer. Otherwise, followup is recommended with a chest
   CT in 12 months.
   3. Contour deformities in the liver and splenic enlargement consistent
   with cirrhosis.
   ECG: EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Evidence of LVH. ?Q in III but
   noncontiguous. No STTWC.
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 56 yo M with history of hemochromatosis and history of CAP,
   presents with LLL pneumonia and hypoxia.
   .
   # Sepsis from LLL pneumonia- patient with elevated lactate,
   hypothermia, leukocytosis with marked bandemia, acute renal failure and
   hypoxia with CT findings consistent with LLL pneumonia. This would be
   CAP, but given significant O2 requirement with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of
   85/0.44 = 193, patient could decompensate further. Currently, patient
   is hemodynamically stable, but given his condition it is reasonable to
   double cover him for GNR.
   - Levoflox 750 daily, CTX 1g 24h
   - sputum culture
   - blood cultures pending
   - monitor clinical status carefully
   - IVF - received 3L already, giving another 1.5L overnight.
   - recheck lactate in AM
   - should receive pneumovax as outpatient, as he seems to come in every
   year in the winter with CAP
   - pain control
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure - Cr 1.7 and spec [**Last Name (un) **] of >1.035, likely prerenal
   azotemia.  Baseline 1.0 in [**12-3**].
   - continue IVF overnight, recheck BUN/Cr in AM
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - patient with splenomegaly on CT scan, with
   ?cirrhosis. Likely secondary to sequestration. Will still continue
   heparin subcut for DVT ppx, but monitor plts.
   .
   # ?Cirrhosis on CT: etiology includes hemochromatosis, chronic hep C,
   etoh. Patient denies etoh. No hepatitis serologies in our system.
   - check hepatitis serologies
   - iron studies
   - coags, LFT's, albumin
   - consider hepatology c/s and possible liver bx while in house once
   clinically improved from pna
   .
   # Hemochromatosis: checking iron studies. Patient notes that he has not
   gone in for therapeutic phlebotomy in several years because he lost his
   insurance.
   - heme consult while in house
   .
   # Pulmonary nodules - discovered on CT scan. ?secondary to infection.
   Should obtain repeat CT scan in [**5-8**] months to eval for interval
   change/resolution.
   .
   # FEN: replete lytes prn, regular heart healthy diet; finish 500 cc NS
   bolus then 1.4 L NS at 200 cc/hr
   .
   # PPx: heparin sc tid, bowel regimen.
   .
   # Access: PIV
   .
   # Code: full
   .
   # Communication: With patient.  NOK is his sister.

   Critical Care
   Present for key portions of history and exam. Agree with assessment and
   plan per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3791**].  Lobar LLL bronchopneumonia in a man with prior
   PNA in same segment. Likely has some degree of bronchiectasis in that
   lobe.  C/O continued pleuritic pain on L.  We are covering for severe
   CAP, controlling pain, monitoring SaO2 and heart rate.  He has been
   stable hemodyn since transfer.  Marked L shift on diff reflects
   severity of infection.  Certainly needs further w/u and therapy for his
   hemochromatosis this adm including echo.  Would consult Hematology and
   liver to see him Monday.
