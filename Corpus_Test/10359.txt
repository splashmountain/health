.
CT abd [**9-30**]:
Small bilateral pleural effusions and stable parenchymal
calcifications which may reflect amiodarone usage.
Cholelithiasis. Stable 1.3 cm left adrenal lesion statistically
representing an adenoma. Stable 2.2 cm septated right renal
cyst. Nodular liver reflecting underlying cirrhosis.
.
CXR [**9-30**]:
Small right pleural effusion. No evidence of congestive heart
failure. No focal infiltrates. There is a small right pleural
effusion. There is no left pleural effusion. Old rib fractures
of several right ribs are unchanged compared to [**2579-2-23**].


Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course by Problem:
.
1) Acidosis: The patient was found to have an anion gap
metabolic acidosis with pH 7.28 in ED.  Ketones were noted in
his urine.  Gap in ED was 34 prior to fluids, improved to 19
after 2L NS in ED.  Delta delta is 22, so corrected bicarb is 30
- some component of metabolic alkalosis possibly from vomiting.
Differential diagnosis for anion gap metabolic acidosis includes
DM, alcohol, starvation - all of which are typically seen with
ketones as in this patient.  Lactic acidosis (also mildly
present here) caused by circulatory/respiratory failure, sepsis,
ischemic bowel, sz, liver failure - patient is hemodynamically
stable so makes these unlikely.  Ingestions also a possibility -
urine and serum tox negative.  Osmolar gap is 13, typically
osmole gap > 10 indicative of ingestion.  Likely a component of
starvation ketosis/ alcoholic ketosis and lactic acidosis in
setting of dehydration and renal failure.
.
Etiology was felt most likely [**2-23**] starvation ketosis (acute on
chronic), with possibility of some component of ingestion.  Pt
was hydrated with 2L IVF in ED, then given additional 3L IVF (2L
d5w + HCO3, 1L D5 NS) in MICU, with closure of GAP.  ethylene
glycol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol level were sent and were
unremarkable.  salicylates unremarkable. D lactate was not sent.

.
After being transferred form the MICU to the regular floor, the
patient's electrolytes were followed and remained stable.
.
2) EtOH abuse: The patient reports drinking two drinks each
night.  LFTs were within normal limits.  A CT scan showed signs
c/w likely cirrhosis.  The patient was treated with CIWA scale
for withdrawal symptoms (did not require any benzos), IV
thiamine, and folic acid.  B12, folate levels were normal.
Coags unremarkable, albumin c/w poor nutritional status.   The
patient was seen by social work.  He admitted to drinking more
than he should, but was not interested in AA or other programs.
He was given information on antabuse, which he will follow up
with his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1253**].  He also consented to meals on wheels
service, which will call him when he gets home for interview/set
up, and his wife will help him with his food until that service
begins.
.
3) Nausea/Vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomitting quickly
improved after admission, and may have been due to viral
gastroenteritis or acidosis.  He was given PO Zofran, which
helped a lot, and he was eating well without nausea or vomitting
prior to discharge.
.
4) Cardiac:
* Ischemia: CAD s/p CABG: Chest pain with wretching.  The
patient's cardiac enzymes were negative x3 and EKG not
significantly changed from prior EKGs.  On further interview,
symptoms suggestive of GERD (typically occur with pepsi, [**Location (un) 114**]
juice, right side chest burning, never elicited by exertion).
The patient was continued beta blocker and statin.  He was
continued on a PPI for GERD symptoms, and his chest pain
resolved.
* Rhythm: Seen by EP in ED, normal pacemaker function.  Multiple
polymorphic PVCs.
The patient was moniroed on telemetry with no events.  He was
continued on his outpatient beta blocker. Because his pacemaker
was interrogated during this admission, the is no need for
follow up at device clinic next week.
* Pump: Euvolemic on exam.
.
5) Acute renal failure: The patient's ARF was likely related to
dehydration, and quickly improved with rehydration (Cr
1.4-->0.9).
.
6) Pancytopenia:  On admission, the patient was 9.1>33.9<180
which steadily decreased to a low of  2.1>25.8<78 before
starting to stabilize the day prior to discharge.  His CBC on
the day of discharge was 2.5>28.7<81.  In [**Hospital1 5593**] records, the
patient has had episodes of pancytopenia in past, thought to be
[**2-23**] chronic alcohol use. He was last seen on heme onc at [**Hospital1 **] in
[**2576**] when counts had recovered after stopping alcohol use.
Talking to his PCP revealed that the patient's baseline
chronically low with his last outpatient CBC being 3.3>29.1<132.
 He was referred to a hematologist at [**Hospital6 **] and
scheduled for a bone marrow biopsy in [**8-27**] but never followed
up.
.
The hematology-oncology team was consulted and performed a bone
marrow biopsy prior to discharge.  Results are pending.  He will
follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in hematology clinic on [**2581-10-12**] for
the results.
.
7) Hypertension: Well controlled, pt continue on home regimen of
beta blocker.
.
8) Asthma: The patient had mild wheezing on exam.  A CXR showed
only a small effusion.  The patient was treated with nebulizers
and inhalaers PRN.  He was breathing comfortably on room air
prior to discharge (o2 sat 97% on RA) with only occasional
wheezes.
.
9) Depression: The patient was continued on his home dose of
zoloft.  He was seen by social work, who also spoke with his
wife who says that he has been depressed for some time now.  He
will follow up with his PCP.
.
10) GERD: Continued on his outpatient PPI.
.
11) FEN: The patient was fed a regular diet, and electrolytes
were aggressively repleted to prevent against refeeding
syndrome.  As mentionned above, the patient will be set up with
meals on wheels to help encourage better nutritional habits at
home.
.
12)  PPx: The patient was on SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
.
13) Code: He was full code during this admission.
