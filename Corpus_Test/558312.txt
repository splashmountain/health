Chief Complaint:  DKA, pneumonia
   HPI:
   47 year old male with h/o IDDM found unresponsive on day of admission
   by his father. [**Name (NI) **] EMS, the patient had a question of blown R pupil,
   Kussmaul respirations and no purposeful movement. He was intubated in
   field and transferred to [**Hospital3 595**]. On arrival he was
   hypotensive with no purposeful movements. He was given narcan 6mgIV
   with no response. CT head was negative per OSH and labs were
   significant for WBC 50.2 with 28% bands, glucose 1259 with AG 35, K
   7.2. On ABG 6.88/23/94/4.3/89% and lactate 2.6.
   CXR was consistant with multifocal pna and question of aspiration. He
   received zosyn, unasyn, 4L IV NS, 1amp Ca gluconate, 1amp HCO3. Given
   no intensivist available at [**Location (un) **] ED she was Transfered [**Hospital1 52**] by
   [**Location (un) **].
   On arrival to ED, patient was hypotensive (83/45, hr 80s), received 4L
   IV NS, IV vancomycin and zosyn were started. Insulin drip at 8U/hr was
   initiated and FS 780 reported prior to ICU transfer. Levophed drip was
   initiated at 0.15/hr with vitals prior to transfer [**Location (un) 289**] at BP 90/47
   HR92. Vent was set to PS [**10-25**] FIO2 of 100, with saturations to 97%.
   According to family (ex-wife provided history), he has had recurrent
   episodes of hyperglycemia (to the 500s) at home. Last week he was taken
   to [**Hospital3 595**] (by ambulance) for hyperglycemia where he was
   admitted for several days. Prior to this he had teeth pulled and was
   given pain medications but not antibiotics. He also recently had a fall
   and was taken to OSH for stitches to his head. He is known to have
   peripheral neuropathy and takes several types of pain medications,
   including a duragesic patch. Otherwise he has not had any other medical
   issues or symptoms to her knowledge.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 43 year old man with history of IDDM found unresponsive at
   home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Toxic-metabolic vs. infectious vs. ingestion
   (? toxicology at OSH). CT head at OSH negative for acute process,
   although there is concern for significant brain injury given report of
   unilateral dilated pupil. Would consult neurology to determine if
   further imaging is necessary to rule out acute process such as storke,
   new-onset seizure and infection (meningitis, encephalitis). Cardiac
   etiology is also possible in a patient with long-standing diabetes.
   Lastly, CXR shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, concerning for
   pneumonia, the most likely nidus of infection on admission. Intubated
   at OSH for unresponsiveness.
   - corrent metabolic acidosis and hyperglycemia as below
   - blood culture, UA and urine culture, sputum culture
   - neurology consult re: need for MRI, EEG
   - repeat CT or f/u final read from OSH
   - EKG and cycle cardiac enzymes
   - continue PS overnight and monitor ABGs post-changes to vent settings
   .
   # Sepsis: In setting of DKA concern for infectious etiology to his
   uresponsive episode. On CXR pulmonary infiltrates could represent
   pneumonia, aspiration vs CAP vs atypical. Hemodynamically he continues
   to require pressors (levophed) with minimal UOP (450cc total at OSH)
   and was admitted to ICU with hypothermia.
   -continue pressors with goal MAP>65
   -IV NS
   -sputum cx and blood cx
   -repeat CXR
   -continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   -maintain UOP>30cc/hr
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: DKA vs. Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State. Possible
   non-compliance with medications vs. underlying infection, especially in
   setting of CXR findings. Patient has history of ICU admission for
   similar presentation one year ago. It is possible pneumonia is source
   of infection, leading to metabolic decompensation and unresponsive
   presentation.
   -insulin gtt
   -q1h fingerstick check
   -replete K slowly
   -UA, urine lytes and osm
   -IV hydration with bicarb, switch to D5W once glucose <200
   -monitor electrolytes q4h
   -pan-cultures as above
   .
   # AG Metabolic acidosis: In setting of hyperglycemia most likely due to
   DKA. Also with some component of rhabdomyolysis (patient found down,
   unclear for how long). Although less likely, given patient was found
   down also consider ingestion.
   - IV NS plus bicarb for now, switch to D5W once glucose <200
   - trend electrolytes q4h, follow AG for resolution
   - serum/urine tox if not done at OSH
   - follow lactate, CK
   .
   # Multifocal pneumonia: Possible aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis in
   setting of unresponsive period, also consider community-acquired
   pneumonia vs influenza. Also, given the similar appearance of CXR from
   this and last admission, opacity on film could be pulmonary edema.
   -repeat CXR
   -sputum culture
   -blood culture
   -continue IV vanco, zosyn for broad spectrum coverage
   .
   # Acute renal failure: baseline cr 0.7, now 2.7. Likely pre-renal in
   setting of dehydration secondary to DKA.
   -monitor UOP
   -IVF hydration
   -renally dose medications
   -follow BUN, Cr
   .
   # Leukocytosis: ? due to rescusitative efforts vs infectious process
   -pan culture
   -IV vanco and zosyn for
   -follow CBC
   .
   # FEN: NPO; monitor and replete electrolytes q4 prn; IVF as above.
