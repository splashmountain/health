   Assessment and Plan
   64 M w/ nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS,
   rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH with DOE,
   transferred for further evaluation of AS, now with GPC bacteremia and
   septic [**Numeric Identifier 1587**].
   .
   # Septic [**Numeric Identifier 1587**]: [**2-10**] MSSA bacteremia. Remains afebrile with decreasing
   white count. Perfusion improving by ScvO2 but still w/ substantial
   pressor requirement; Hct @ goal. Swan placed yesterday for better
   hemodynamic monitoring which revealed that patient is volume overloaded
   based on PCWP of 36. CVP improved with diuresis overnight
   - wean levophed as able to maintain MAP >65
   - uptitrate Dobutamine as tolerated by heart rate to maintain ScvO2>70%
   - maintain CVP>[**8-18**]
   - maintain Hct>30%
   - rewedge today
   - continue Vancomycin, fup vanco level pending this am.
   - serial blood Cx
   - obtain additional information re:prior hx of MRSA infection

   # Liver failure: LFT

s. hepatitis
   pattern of unclear etiology, likely [**2-10**] [**Last Name (LF) 1587**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be superimposed
   element of congestive hepatopathy; U/S neg for cholangitis or
   cholecystitis. Synthetic function worsened with increasing INR
   - f/u viral studies
   - liver consult appreciated
   - trend LFT
   - avoid hepatotoxic medications
   - tylenol 2gm max
   .
   # AS: [**Location (un) **] 0.8 cm2 in cath lab; surgical repair candidate given symptoms
   of CHF however will need to clear infection prior to consideration for
   surgery
   - CT [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   # Acute on chronic systolic heart failure
 Still volume overloaded,
   gentle diuresis given AS and still displaying septic physiology
   - decrease lasix gtt to 5mg/hr.  goal 1L neg.
   .
   # Dyspnea
 Chronic symptoms is multifactorial [**2-10**] COPD, CHF, pulmonary
   hypertension
   - continue suppl. O2 to maintain O2 sats>93%
   - continue albuterol nebs

   #Afib - atrial fibrillation with rate-related aberrancy. INR 2.1 [**2-10**]
   decreased liver synthetic function.
   -restart BB when hemodynamically stable
   -will need to discuss long-term anti-coagulation when INR trends down
   -trend INR for now

   # Back pain
 Patient c/o increased back pain likely [**2-10**] lying flat for
   several days in a patient with pre-existing lumbar back disease. Given
   bacteremia, fevers and point tenderness, will maintain high suspicion
   for possible infection
   -low dose narcotics to manage
   -OOB to chair
