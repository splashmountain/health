History of Present Illness:
HPI:  69 Year old man with a PMH of STEMI w/ stents to the LAD
in [**2938**] presents today after transfer via [**Location (un) 2045**] from [**Location (un) **]
where he came this am with chest pain determined via ECG to be
an anterior MI.  His pain was relieved by Nitroglycerin.  In the
cath lab at [**Hospital1 68**], he had a cypher stent placed to the LAD where
the previous stent had re-stenosed.  The right side was also
found to be stenotic approx. 90% but this was not stented today.
 The pt. denies SOB, CP, DOE, PND, orthopnea, cough, nausea,
vomiting.  Plan is to return to cath lab in 2 days for stenting
of the right sided lesion(s).  The patient is now resting
comfortably in NAD and no CP.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 69 Year old man with a PMH of STEMI w/ stents to the
LAD presents today with STEMI requiring stents to LAD and plan
to re-cath with Right sided stents in 2 days.
.
Plan:
1) CAD.  STEMI on EKG done at [**Hospital6 6059**].
Enzymes as follows:  1st set (OSH), CK 53 Trpo <0.04; 2nd set
([**Hospital1 68**]) CK 63
Trop <0.01; 3rd Set CK 803  MB 87 Trop 4.38; 4th set CK 478  MB
50  Trop 2.42
.
Cardiac catheterization revealed the following on [**7-20**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominany system
revealed two vessel coronary artery disease. The left main
coronary artery was without angiographyically apparent flow
limiting stenosis. The left anterior descending coronary artery
had stent in the proximal segment. The proximal portion of the
stent was patent, but there was a 99% in-stent restenosis in the
distal portion of the stent beyond the origin of D1. There was
TIMI I flow beyond the lesion. The left circumflex coronary
artery was patent in the proximal, mid, and distal segments. The
right coronary artery was the dominant vessel and had a focal
90% stenosis in the proximal segment. The mid and distal RCA
were without angiographically apparent flow limiting stenoses.
2. Right heart catheterization revealed mildly elevated right
sided
pressures. The pulmonary capillary wedge pressures mean was 20
mmgh.
3. There was a preserved cardiac output and index.
4. Successful stent was placed to the LAD on [**7-20**] with a 3.0 x
23 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent
.
Cardiac catheterization revealed the following on [**7-22**]:
1. Coronary angiography of this right-dominat circulation showed
single-vessel CAD. The LMCA, LAD and LCX were free of
flow-limiting
disease. The LAD stent was widely patent. The RCA had an 80%
proximal
and a 30% mid vessel stenosis.
2. Resting hemodynamics showed normal central aortic pressures.
3. Successful stenting of the RCA with a 3.5 mm Cypher
drug-eluting
stent, which was post-dilated to 4.0 mm. Final angiography
showed no
residual stenosis, no dissection and normal flow (see PTCA
comments).
.
Pt is doing well s/p stent placement to L and R sided lesion.
  - [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], Atorvastatin, tirofiban
  - Will restart Beta Blocker once HR increases a bit
  - CP free for now.  All cardiac enzymes negative.
.
Echo done [**7-22**] revealed the following:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed with severe hypokinesis of the mid to distal septum
and apex. EF 45%.  No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
2) Decreased K+
  - Repleated throughout visit for K <4.0.  Can follow
electrolytes with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
3) Pump
  - EF 45% on [**2944-7-22**] (35% in [**11-23**]). HR low in 40s-50s.  Held
Beta blocker for low HR on days [**11-24**].  Restarted day 3.
Discharged on Toprol XL 50mg daily.  Also added lisinopril at
2.5mg daily.  Can titrate up at visit with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at LGH.
