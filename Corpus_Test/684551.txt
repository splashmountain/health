   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known patient lastname 11798**] is a 72 year-old female with pmh of hypertension, HL,
   depression, and GERD who was admitted to the MICU on [**2-27**] with
   hypotension and trop leak, found to have apical ballooning on TTE
   suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
   # Hypotension/Acute systolic heart failure/Takotsubo
s cardiomyopathy:
   Good response to lasix IV
   - continue to diurese with lasix IV
 bolus 20mg today.
   - Continue heparin gtt for prevention of thrombus in the setting of
   apical ballooning.  Start Coumadin today.
   - captopril 6.25tid
   - She will need a repeat TTE as an prior to discharge to reassess her
   cardiac function.
   #Anemia: may be hemodilutional, but in setting of heparin a GI source
   needs to be considered.  Patient has no lower back pain that would be
   evidence of RP bleed.  Stools are guiaic negative, hct stable.
   -daily hct.
   -change ppi to oral omeprazole.
   #Abdominal pain: patient feels bloated, gas pain.  She has not had a
   bowel movement since admission.
   -          continue senna/colace/bisacodyl
   -          simethecone for gas.
   # Chest pain/coronaries:  Her cardiac cath showed clean coronaries.
   Most likely her chest pain was due to Takotsubo
s cardiomyopathy vs an
   acute coronary artery occlusion which quickly self lysed.  She
   continues to have some chest pain at present.
   - Pain control with oxycodone 5 mg q4h prn and Tylenol prn.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily.
   - Continue simvastatin 40 mg po daily.
   # Mitral regurgitation:  The patient has known mitral regurgitation and
   is followed as an outpatient for this with yearly echos.  Due to the
   concern for a flail leaflet, CT [**Doctor First Name 204**] was consulted.
   - Appreciate CT [**Doctor First Name 204**] consult, will f/u recs.
   - Treatment for acute heart failure as above.
   # Rhythm:  She is currently in sinus rhythm.
   - Monitor on tele.
   # Gallbladder wall thickening/Concern for infection:  There was initial
   concern on admission that the patient
s hypotension was related to
   infection, specifically an intraabdominal infection involving the
   gallbladder.  Her CTA revealed gallbladder wall thickening, however she
   currently has no abdominal pain and has been afebrile.
   - F/u BCx.
   # Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Most likely secondary to the many
   liters of normal saline she received for hypotension.
   - Resolved.
   # Depression:
   - Continue home buproprion and ativan prn.
