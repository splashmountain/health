   Assessment and Plan
   64 year old gentleman with NASH cirrhosis, seizure disorder and
   increasing debilitation continues in the ICU after a seizure.  He
   remains intubated for airway protection and unsuccessfully weaned from
   ventilation.
   # Respiratory failure:  Witnessed apnea during code and recent HCAP.
   Still requires ventilatory support for what appears to be pulmonary
   edema.  Tolerated PS trial in AM, but still tachypneic
   - Lasix gtt to goal output of 1 liter by afternoon
   - Wean as tolerated, with hope to extubate this afternoon.
   - Hold TF in anticipation of extubation
   # Seizure disorder:  Keppra order had expired, will restart today.
   - Phenytoin taper- currently QD x3 days (ending [**2668-12-2**])
   - Keppra 2250 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Topamax 200mg PO BID
   # Hypernatremia:  Resolved.
   - D/C free water flushes as attempting to reduce volume.
   - Check PM lytes given diuresis
   .
   # Hypogylcemia
   -  currently resolved and trending up.  Will give
 dose of insulin
   today as
 dose yesterday still made patient hypoglycemic and currently
   hold TF
   # Cirrhosis: [**12-21**] NASH, LFTs/bili/coags have not been elevated.
   Abdominal U/S of liver w/ normal TIPS evaluation with wall-to-wall
   flow. No ascites identified.
   - lactulose, rifaxamin-suspect this is contributing to loose stool
   # Stage IV sacral decubitous ulcer: XR of sacral area did not suggest
   osteomyelitis.
   - continue current would care with packing daily
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure: Most recent echo in [**Month (only) 94**].  Mild
   LVH.  Stable on exam.
   # HTN: Blood pressures well-controlled while in-house on metop 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **].
   # CAD: stress MIBI in [**2-23**] w/ Fixed, medium sized, severe perfusion
   defect involving the PDA territory.  Increased left ventricular cavity
   size. Inferior hypokinesis with preserved systolic function.  No recent
   h/o chest pain.  Most recent echo with improved EF.
   # DM2: BS more elevated over the last day in the 200s.
   - continue current regimen of lantus and humalog and titrate up prn
   # Pancytopenia:  Chronic issue, likely BM suppression or secondary to
   seizure medications.
   - trend for now
   - guaiac stools
   # Hypothyroid: levothyroxine
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes prn, Tube feeds via PEG-Held
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: PICC
   # Code: Full (confirmed w/ family)
   # Communication: Patient
