   Assessment and Plan: 84 year old woman with history of GERD, presents
   with melena.
   .
   # Melena: Differential includes PUD (including Dieulafoy's lesion),
   gastritis, esophagitis, or given history of dysphagia, esophageal mass.
   Ischemic colitis also possible given h/o CAD, but this would be
   unlikely to produce melanotic stools.  Varices and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1809**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 108**] tear
   unlikely given no history of liver disease or vomiting. Pt has refused
   EGD on past admission. Vital signs stable overnight. No further melena.
   - Active T+S
   - Change pantoprazole gtt 8 mg/hr to [**Hospital1 **]
   - F/u GI recs
   - Advance diet to full liquids (NPO after midnight)
   - Serial hct's
   - Hold aspirin, coumadin
   - Two large-bore PIV's in place
   .
   # Chest pain: Per report pt complained of CP in ED, but on admission
   she reports LUQ pain that with reflux symptoms. Pt has known CAD, with
   most recent cath in [**2874**] showing 2-vessel coronary artery disease. On
   the pt's most recent admission CP was attributed to GERD, and EKG was
   unremarkable. Pt did take daily aspirin on day of admission, but did
   not take coumadin.
   - Hold aspirin for now given above bleeding
   - Rule-out MI, serial EKGs
   - PPI as above.
   - Continue statin, Lisinopril, Metoprolol
   - Hold Isosorbide given concern for bleeding
   .
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Pt is anticoagulated on coumadin, and
   is also on amiodarone for maintenance of sinus rhythm.
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Hold coumadin
   - Hold on reversing with Vit K, if pt has additional melena, consider
   Vit K
   - D/w GI what INR threshold they will tolerate for EGD (likely < 1.7)
   .
   # Ischemic cardiomyopathy: EF from echo in [**2874**] was 30-40%. Pt
   currently appears euvolemic, with no lower extremity edema.
   - Hold lasix given concern for GIB
   - Monitor I/O's
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, full liquids, NPO after midnight
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: peripherals
   # Communication: Patient (HCP = landlady)
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient)

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. Please see admit note
   for histories and ROS, which are unchanged.
   84 year-old woman with h/o GERD presented with 3 episodes of melena
   yesterday.  Described associated left upper quadrant pain.  No recent
   NSAIDS. WBC 6, HCT 35.
   I examined the pt and agree with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 11859**]
 description, above.
   MICU course: Remained hemodynamically stable. Hct stable. Ruled out for
   MI. On oral PPI. No stool in MICU, no evidence of further bleeding. 2
   peripheral IVs. Endoscopy is planned for tomorrow. Safe for transfer to
   med floor.
