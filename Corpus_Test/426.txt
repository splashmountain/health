Echocardiogram on [**3273-5-30**]:
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Normal regional LV systolic function. No
resting LVOT  gradient.
IMPRESSION: Well seated aortic bioprosthesis with high-normal
gradient and  trace aortic regurgitation. Pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Mild  mitral regurgitation.  If
clinically indicated, a TEE would be better able to define a
structural  abnormality involving the aortic valve.

CT Chest on [**3273-5-30**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Three parenchymal abnormalities new over six months, the
largest in the left lower [**Year (4 digits) 3579**] and two in the right upper and
right middle lobes.  Given their nodular appearance and
patient's symptoms of infection, Nocardia infection would be the
most likely diagnosis, especially for the left lower [**Year (4 digits) 3579**]
consolidation. Alternatively, the two, smaller right lung
lesions could be PTLD.
2.  Cardiomegaly. Status post aortic valve replacement and CABG.
 Sternal
dehiscence with peristernal fat stranding and collections might
represent
osteomyelitis. If this diagnosis is plausible clinically, MRI or
radionuclide scanning would be be helpful to confirm.

Echocardiogram on [**3273-6-2**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity  size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal.  The aortic arch
is mildly dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present and appears well-seated. The transaortic gradient is
normal for this prosthesis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 4 mmHg) due to
mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.  No vegetation seen.

Renal transplant ultrasound on [**3273-6-2**]:
IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable renal transplant in the left iliac
fossa with some mild fullness of the collecting system, which is
reduced  when compared with the previous ultrasound from
[**11-7**].


Brief Hospital Course:
# Pneumonia: Patient improved on Vancomycin/Meropenem started
empirically for sepsis broad spectrum coverage.  However,
culture-data and fungal organism tests remained negative.  He
was therefore transitioned to oral levofloxacin and discharged
on this regimen, with specific instruction to contact his
physician immediately if he had recurrence of any symptoms or
fevers.  Due to finding of incidental lung nodules, will repeat
chest CT in 1 month.
.
# HYPERTENSION: Continued metoprolol.
.
# Renal transplant: Initially with renal failure that resolved
with treatment of sepsis and hydration.  Continued sirolimus and
cellcept.
.
# DM - Continued RISS, standing insulin.
.
# Prophylaxis:  Pantoprazole, pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis,
bowel medications as necessary.
