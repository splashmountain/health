History of Present Illness:
44 year old male on [**3396-2-26**] he was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 52**]
following an episode of chest pain/pressure while walking to his
car.  He was completely rulled out for an MI and followed up
with cardiology as an outpatient (cardiology believes reflux
related).  After discharge he was worked up: CTA showed no
aortic pathology, EGD normal mucosa, coronary cath showed patent
stent with to evidence of CAD, and PFTs showed obstructive
defect.  Additionally, he underwent an alcohol rehabilitation
program at [**Hospital1 **].
Since [**2-5**] hospitalization, he has had increasing shortness of
breath on exertion.  He used to only notice it while walking,
now he get short of breath while giving presentations sitting
down.  When he gets short of breath it feels like a pressure on
his chest and pain in the epigastric region.  When he rests the
symptoms resolve.  He denies LE edema, has orthopnea (two
pillows to sleep), notes abdominal  distention/bloating over the
previous 6 mo, denies any weight gain/loss, restless sleep,
decreased appetite.  He has never been jaundiced and received
the HepB vaccination.  Except for HIV, he has never had any
other STI.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No
dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
Over the past 3-4 weeks he has developed a productive cough with
yellow sputum.  He also notes he can hear expiratory wheezes at
night.  He denies sick contacts, fevers, or night sweats.
Over the past few days, he has been feeling nausea after eating.
 He notes multiple episodes of dry heaves where he just spit up
clear liquid.  He vomited twice and denies any frank blood,
coffee grounds or different colored material.

.
Echocardiography [**3396-8-1**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The interatrial septum is
aneurysmal. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is mild to moderate global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present with thickened leaflets and markedly
increased gradient (peak 100mmHg) c/w severe aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is
eccentric and may be underestimated. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**3394-9-12**],
the gradient across the aortic valve is markedly increased and
c/w severe aortic valve stenosis. Aortic regurgitation and
global left ventricular systolid dysfunction are now seen as
well as moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.
.
Coronary catheterization [**3396-8-4**]:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
no
angiographically signicant CAD.
2. Severe prosthetic valve aortic stenosis with markedly
elevated
filling pressures and very low cardiac output.

Brief Hospital Course:
Presented with six months of progressive dyspnea on exertion and
2-pillow orthopnea.  He was given ASA 325mg, ceftriazone (to
cover SBP), zofran and ativan in the ED.  On the floor, he was
given Azithromycin (to cover CAP), lasix 10mg (to diurese
pulmonary edema and ascites), albuteral nebs (for wheezes) and
multivitamin.  He responded well to diuretics.  On day 2 of
hospitalization, a diagnostic thoracentesis was performed to
clarify the cause of the pleural effusions.  During the
procedure, he became diaphoretic and syncopized.  He then
appeared to seize and was incontinent of urine and stool.  A
code blue was called but the patient was never asystole.  Once
he was stable he was transfered to the ICU where he seized
again.  Of note, the pleural chemistry was consistent with a
transudate, as per Light's Criteria. As part of his work-up in
the MICU, the patient got an echocardiogram.  The echo showed
that the patient's bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis was
present with thickened leaflets and markedly increased gradient
consistent with severe aortic valve stenosis.  Cardiology and
cardiac surgery were consulted so that a plan could be developed
to replace the patient's sclerosed aortic valve.  After his
second day in the MICU, the patient was transferred to a step
down unit where it was decided that he should undergo cardiac
catheterization to rule out ischemia and better assess his
aortic valve.  Cath showed clean coronaries, critical aortic
stenosis (valve area 0.3cm) and a cardiac output of 1.3.  The
patient was then transferred to the CCU for close monitoring of
his hemodynamics. In the CCU he was diuresed with a heparin drip
and diuril 500mg IV to a total -3.5L.  This provided symptomatic
improvement in his respiratory status and abdominal distention,
and his LFTs continued to trend down.  He was cleared by
hepatology and ID for surgery and carotid ultrasounds were
negative.  lasix gtt was stopped on [**8-6**] [**2-29**] hypotension (SBP
80s), sinus tachycardia (Hr90s) and Creatinine bump to 1.4.
Creatinine went back down to 1.2 that same day but lasix gtt
continued to be held. He was otherwise stable while awaiting
surgery.  In addition, he had a rapidly increasing
transaminitis.  On admission his statin was held due to concerns
of liver toxicity.  A RUQ US showed heterogeneous architecture
suggestive of fatty liver and small ascites.  The 2nd day of
admission his HIV medications and Buspar dose was reduced from
15mg to 10mg for toxicity concerns.  Hepatitis serologies were
not suggestive of an acute infection.  Urine and serum tox
screens were negative.  Upon transfer to the ICU, more of the
patient's medications were weaned, including buspirone and
paroxetine.  However, after the patient's echocardiogram
revealed the significant sclerosis that had occured on his
prosthetic aortic valve, it was believed that his transaminitis
was most likely secondary to shock liver.  After he was
transferred out of the unit his LFTs slowly trended down with
diuresis and improving hemodynamics.  Pattern of injury most
consistent with alcoholism and congestion. Also hyponatremia,
likely in the setting of diuresis. Also possibly med effect
(SSRIs).  Could also be secondary to liver disease. Hyponatremia
persisted throughout stay but improved slightly, Na 132 by
[**3396-8-7**] prior to OR.
-------------------
Cardiac Surgery:
He was taken to cardiac surgery on for a re-do sternotomy for
placement of mechanical AVR on [**3396-8-10**]. Refer to operative notes
for details. He received vancomycin perioperative as he was in
the hospital preoperatively.  Post operatively, he was admitted
to the cardiovascular ICU for intensive post-operative care. He
was weaned and extubated without difficulty. His chest tubes and
temporary pacing wires were removed per protocol. He was started
on coumadin with IV heparin bridge. He was discharged to home on
postoperative day seven when his INR was therapeutic. Target INR
is 2.5-3.0 for mechanical aortic valve. Coumadin /INR will be
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. First blood draw is [**3396-8-18**] with
results called to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
