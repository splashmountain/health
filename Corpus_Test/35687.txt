[**2564-8-6**] Echo: Pre Bypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.
Post Bypass: Preserved biventricular function. LVEF>55%. There
is a mechanical aortic prosthesis insitu (#19 by report) with
good leaflet motion and no perivalvular leaks. Peak gradient
40's, mean 20's post bypass. Aortic contours intact. TR is now
mild. Remaining exam is unchanged. All findings discussed with
surgeons at the time of the exam.

Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2564-8-9**] 3:01 PM

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
   32 year old woman with AVR/Ao root enlargement
Final Report
HISTORY: 32-year-old female status post AVR. Assess interval
change.
PA and lateral chest radiographs are compared to [**2564-8-8**]. A right
IJ central venous catheter tip projects over the mid SVC, as
before. Median sternotomy wires are intact. The cardiac
silhouette is unchanged. There is improved aeration in the
retrocardiac region compared to one day prior. There is improved
aeration at the bases compared to one day prior. Small pleural
effusions are probably unchanged allowing for positional
differences. The upper lungs are clear.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known patient firstname 1148**] [**Known patient lastname **] was a same day admit after undergoing
pre-operative work-up prior to surgery. On [**8-6**] she was brought
to the operating room where she underwent an aortic valve
replacement and aortic root enlargement. Please see operative
report for surgical details. In summary she had an Aortic valve
replacement with #19 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 262**] mechanical valve, she also had an
aortic root enlargment with a pericardial patch. Her bypass time
was 84 minutes with a crossclamp of 66 minutes. She tolerated
the operation well and following surgery she was transferred to
the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24
hours she was weaned from extubation, awoke neurologically
intact and extubated. On post-op day one patient was transferred
to the telemetry floor for further care. Chest tubes and
epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. Coumadin was
started on POD#1 and IV heparin on POD#2. INR was therapeutic on
POD#4 and heparin was discontinued.

Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] complained of right shoulder pain radiating down
humerus with limited abduction; sensation and strentgh is
intact. Symptoms likely d/t positioning on OR table. Evaluated
by PT/OT/and orthopedic service sling given for support when out
of bed. Neurontin added to pain med regimen. Will have home
PT/OT.
On POD 4 Ms [**Known patient lastname **] was ready for discharge home with visiting
nurses aas well as home PT/OT. She is to follow-up w/Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
in 1 month
