   Assessment and Plan
   77-year-old woman with primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma with
   brain and cervical spine metastases presented after fall at home
   transferred to ICU with PCP pneumonia and hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia which appears worse by
   CXR. Increasing O2 requirement and increased work of breathing
   therefore patient was intubated. Currently doing well on AC with FIO2
   of 60%.
   -          Continue AC
   -          Monitor ABG if changes to vent
   -          Continue pentamidine
   #  PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: Has received one weeks of Bactrim treatment dose with
   minimal response. [**Month (only) 56**] need to change coverage to pentamidine. Will
   consult ID. Given hyponatremia, will change Bactrim to liquid PO via
   NG.
   - continue Pentamidine, monitor LFTs
   - continue dex 4 mg q8h  (equivalence to 40 mg prednisone [**Hospital1 **] for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **])
   - Monitor WBC, fever curve
   - Ck daily CXR
   - F/U ID recs
   #Hypotension: Likely secondary to sedation, PEEP. Requiring small doses
   of levophed.
   - Attempt to wean sedation
   - Wean pressors
   # Hyponatremia: Urine osm and Urine sodium consistent with SIADH,
   likely secondary to her pulmonary process. Although, known brain mets
   can also cause SIADH. Today serum Na 127
   -          continue fluid restriction as tolerated
   -          monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Weakness: with proximal muscle weakness, likely steroid-induced
   myopathy. ?worsening CNS involvement. Also in the setting of possible
   pneumonia. Telemetry unremarkable. Brain and C-spine MRI showed stable
   mets. Cannot wean off steroids yet due to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
   - symptomatic treatment, PT as tolerated once out of ICU
   - Nutritional status is poor given poor appetite, boost/supplements
   .
   # Ovarian cancer with CNS mets: stable mets on MRI. On
   irinotecan/bevacizumab.
   - continue steroids
   - chemo on hold in setting of acute illness
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # Prophylaxis: PPI, hep SC, bowel regimen
   .
   # FEN:  NPO, [**Hospital1 **] finger sticks while on steroids.
   - monitor another set of lytes to confirm serum sodium is stable
   - consult nutrition for recs
   - Autodiuresing while on pressors. Monitor BP, UO. Bolus as needed.
   # Dispo: ICU level of care for now.
