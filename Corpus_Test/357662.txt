   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**1-9**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2755-1-15**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**1-22**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach ane PEG [**2840-1-25**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem
   - optimiazing cardiac status with betablocker and CCB
 changed to IV
   yesterday
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**1-24**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Has blood tinged vomit yesterday.  Hct
   was stable in high 20
s.  GIU c/s obtained who agreeded that bleeding
   was not an acute issue and emergent scope not indicated inless GIB
   worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we
   want this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen and they
   don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her
   getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a total of
   4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - Restarted PPI yesterday
 with close monitoring of plt count
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable in 90-100
s.  Unclear cause. Possibiilties
   include antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued for this
   reason; however, had to be restarted today in setting of potential GI
   bleed. Patient received plt transfusion 2 days ago with bump to 122
   from 65/  PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies
   include infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   - Restart tube feeds with predosing of Zofran from nausea
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Will need scope if bleeds with tube feeds
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - will change back to po dilt and carvediolol with tube feeds, titrate
   up as necessary
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Restarted carvediolol
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2833**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   # Hypertension: Patient had elevated SBP's overnight  Was given an
   additional 5 mg IV metoprolol (in addition to 10 mg IV q6h), however
   her SBPs remained in the 180's to 190's (asymptomatic).  She was given
   10 mg IV hydralazine and her metoprolol was increased to 15 mg IV q6h.
   BP
s now in 120
s-130
   - Close monitoring as weaning sedation and pain medication
   - changed to po meds as above with prn hydralazine, titrate up as
   necessary
   #Agitation:   Was agitatioed last night at time of increaed bp
   recevied haldol with good effect
   -haldol prn for night time agitation
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).
