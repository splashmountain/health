CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man with
peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, and coronary
artery disease, positive stress test and preserved ejection
fraction who was admitted in [**Month (only) **] of this year for a cardiac
workup, refused surgical intervention at that time, and has
had recurrent episode of chest pain.  He underwent cardiac
catheterization at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital and transferred to [**Hospital1 1426**] for possible surgical option.

ethanol use.

Echocardiogram done in [**2620-6-13**], showed an ejection fraction
of 60 percent with one plus aortic regurgitation and one plus
mitral regurgitation.  He had a positive stress test in [**Month (only) **]
of this year.  Also, cardiac catheterization done at [**Hospital3 **]
Hospital showed 90 percent ostial left anterior descending
coronary artery, 50 percent mid lesion, 80 percent obtuse

coronary artery with a 70 percent proximal lesion and ramus
with a 20 percent lesion.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily.
2. Aspirin 325 mg once daily.
3. IMDUR 30 mg once daily.
4. Nitroglycerin p.r.n.
5. Norvasc 7.5 mg once daily.
6. Ambien q.h.s.
7. Pentoxifylline 400 mg twice a day.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97, heart rate 60, blood
pressure 113/67, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 100
percent in room air.  An elderly man in no acute distress.
Speaks Russian.  He is younger than age.  Respiratory is
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular is regular
rate and rhythm.  The abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Right groin catheterization site no hematoma.
Extremities are warm with no edema.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia, heart rate 50, T
wave inversion in lead [**Last Name (LF) 1091**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] changes in aVF.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the medical
service and CT surgery was consulted and the patient was seen
and accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting.  On
[**2620-8-3**], he went to the operating room at which he underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting times three. Please see the
operating room report for full details.  In summary, he had a
coronary artery bypass graft times three with left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary
artery, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal,
saphenous vein graft to left posterior descending coronary
artery.  His bypass time was 69 minutes with a cross clamp
time of 54 minutes.  He tolerated the operation well and was
transferred from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.  The patient did well in the immediate
postoperative period.  His anesthesia was reversed.  He was
weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated on
postoperative day number one.  He remained hemodynamically
stable requiring Nitroglycerin to maintain an adequate blood
pressure.  He was begun on Lasix as well as Lopressor and his
chest tubes were discontinued.  He remained in the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit for close hemodynamic
monitoring.  On postoperative day number two, the patient
remained hemodynamically stable in sinus rhythm.  His
preoperative Norvasc was resumed.  The patient remained in
the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit as he was slightly
confused and lethargic.  Additionally, the patient's Foley
catheter was removed on postoperative day number three. The
patient continued to be hemodynamically stable.  His beta
blocker and diuretic doses were increased.  He failed to void
and his Foley was reinserted.  He was additionally started on
Flomax and the patient was kept in the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit yet again for monitoring of his pulmonary
and neurological status.  On postoperative day number four,
the patient continued to do well hemodynamically.  His minor
confusion had cleared by this point and he was less lethargic
and he was transferred to the floor for continuing
postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation. Following
transfer to the floor, the patient was found in the bathroom
somewhat unresponsive and he was placed in the bed.  At that
point, he was fully responsive, cooperative and following
commands.  He had a heart rate in the 90s and a blood
pressure of 150/90.  He had no memory of the event.
Following this event, neurology was consulted as well as
cardiology.  Both the neurology service and the cardiology
service felt that this event was due to cough syncope.  The
patient continued on telemetry for close hemodynamic and
cardiac event monitoring.  Over the next several days, the
patient's activity level was advanced with the help of the
nursing staff and the physical therapist.  He remained
hemodynamically stable with no further syncopal events.  He
had a head CT that showed no hemorrhage and only old chronic
infarcts.  On postoperative day number eleven, it was decided
that the patient would be stable and ready for discharge
within the next day or two.  At that time, the patient's
physical examination was as follows:  Vital signs revealed
temperature 97.6, heart rate 85, sinus rhythm, blood pressure
120/40, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 93 percent in
room air.  Laboratories showed sodium 136, potassium 4.2,
chloride 106, CO2 22, blood urea nitrogen 24, creatinine 1.2,
glucose 115.  White blood cell count 14.0, hematocrit 32.0,
platelet count 435,000.  Physical examination revealed he is
alert and responsive, respiratory rate clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiovascular shows regular rate and rhythm,
S1 and S2, no murmur.  The sternum is stable.  The incision
is open to air, clean and dry.  The abdomen is soft,
nontender, nondistended, with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities are warm and well perfused with no edema.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Metoprolol 25 mg twice a day.
2. Amlodipine 10 mg once daily.
3. Aspirin 325 mg once daily.
4. Simvastatin 20 mg once daily.
5. Tamsulosin 0.4 q.h.s.
6. Zantac 150 mg twice a day.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Coronary artery disease, status post

internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending
coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and
saphenous vein graft to left posterior descending coronary
artery.

Hypertension.

Peripheral vascular disease.

Status post appendectomy.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to be discharged to
rehabilitation.  He is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in two
to three weeks following his discharge from rehabilitation
