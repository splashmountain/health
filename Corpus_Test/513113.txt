   Assessment and Plan
   70yo man w/ severe COPD, h/o lung ca, CHF, HTN, who presented w/
   question of GI bleed was stable, then developed sudden shock.  Question
   of MI vs PE +/- sepsis.
   # Shock: At this point presuming primary insult precipitating
   cardiogenic shock was major MI.  [**Month (only) 56**] at this point be clouded picture
   with possible component of a septic picture.  Pt still requiring
   pressors, may be indicative of increased ventricular stretch in setting
   of fluid overload from oliguria, placing patient outside of starling
   curve.
   -continue zosyn, monitor clinically and by CXR, if decompensates
   consider broadening to double coverage for GNRs. Current plan is 7 day
   course of zosyn, currently day 4.
   - follow up cards recs, will discuss with them today recommendations
   regarding when to start aspirin, increasing statin in setting of
   recovering shock liver and guidance with starting BB and possibly ACEI
   in setting of depressed EF, ? when to repeat TTE.
   - Continue to hold BB while on dopamine
   - Taper steroids to PO solumedrol (currently 20mg Q8)
   -fluid removal with HD per renal, see below.
   -wean pressors as tolerated after dialysis.
   #Respiratory failure
 Pt has c/o severe COPD, recently hospitalized
   for exacerbation, however initially during presentation ventilation was
   not a factor.  Intubated for airway protection in setting of
   obtundation.  Had been oxygenating well, minute ventilation increased
   in setting of acidosis.  Tried to decrease Fi02, increased A-a
   gradient, likely fluid overload.  Better oxygenation on gas this
   morning.
   -continue daily wake ups, response this morning encouraging in terms of
   mental status.
   -minimize sedation
   -Fluid removal as below.
   -will tolerate relative hypoxemia given pt
s known severe COPD.
   -Will decrease Fi02 after dialysis, SBT, consider extubation in am,
   will need to hold TF
   #  ARF: likely acute on chronic due to shock/ATN, trying to now
   maintain MAPS greater than 65.  Oliguric with persistently climbing
   BUN/cr, with non-gap metabolic acidosis. Urine sediment with  muddy
   brown casts consistent with ATN. Unclear if pt would regain much renal
   function at this point.  Pt currently up 11L this admission.
   -Appreciate renal involvement, goal to remove as much fluid as possible
   using pressors as necessary to make this possible.
   -tx 3 units FFP yesterday, had LIJ HD catheter place, required
   transfusion of blood and platelets in this setting with significant
   bleeding and hematoma formation.
   -Monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes, treat K as needed.
   -minimize IVF given
   -renally dose meds.
   <I>## Elevated LFTs:</I> Suspect shock liver
   -transaminases trending down, bili trending up, continue to follow
   bili.
   -caution with increasing statin.
   # Coagulopathy: suspect [**3-6**] liver dysfunction and DIC
   - d/w cards when to start asa again,
   -monitor INR/CBC, give products when necessary for procedures or
   bleeding.
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Labs c/w DIC.
   -Tx for platelets <50 or active bleeding.
   <I>## COPD:</I>Continue steroids (tapering down today),  duonebs
   .
   <I>## HTN:</I>Continue to hold all antihypertensives
   .
   <I>## HL:</I>Continue statin, consider increasing
   #Thrush
 continue nystatin
