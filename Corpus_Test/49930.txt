Chief Complaint:
Cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
VATS

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 80 year old female with cerebral palsy, HTN,
hypothyroid, PAF, osteoporosis here s/p mech fall on R side 3
weeks ago (no head or neck trauma) who presents with 3 days of
nonproductive cough, low grade fever, leukocytosis and a CXR
that shows new R pleural effusion concerning for hemothorax
versus paraneumonic effusion. The patient states she slipped on
water 3 weeks ago, landing on ankle. Had significant swelling in
right LE and yesterday had a film that showed no fracture.
However, had also developed right sided flank/rib pain
approximately 3 days ago. Patient believes this may have been
related to twisting while getting out of bed and currently is
only present on movement. A rib film to evaluate this
demonstrated a right sided pleural effusion with question of
loculation. Patient came to the ED to be further evaluated.
.
Presented to the ED today and was found on repeat CXR to have
continued loculated pleural effusion. CT without contrast was
done to see if able to delineate between paraneumonic vs.
hemothorax, but still unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] denies any SOB, DOE,
chest pain, lightheadedness, dizziness. States cough present for
one week, nonproductive. No fevers, chills, night sweats, but
+fatigue. Labs demonstrated elevated WBC. Was given ceftriaxone
and azithromycin in ED and blood cultures sent. Currently she
states that she feels better than when she first presented to
the ED.
.
ROS significant for constipation, last BM on Monday, as well as
mild nausea, no vomiting. O/W negative for HA, URI sxs, chest
pain, orthopnea, PND, palpatations, melena, hematochezia,
dysuria, hesitancy.

Pertinent Results:
Right ankle films [**3173-4-10**]:
HISTORY: Right ankle pain.
Four radiographs of the right ankle demonstrate normal
mineralization. No fracture. The mortise is congruent. Talar
dome maintains a normal contour. Phleboliths are noted within
the regional soft tissues. The subtalar joint is normal.
IMPRESSION:
Unremarkable radiographs of the right ankle.
.
CXR [**3173-4-10**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of rib fracture or pneumothorax.
2. New moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion with evidence
of
loculation. Right basilar airspace opacities likely representing
atelectasis
.
CXR [**3173-4-11**]:
There is a persistent moderate-to-large multiloculated right
pleural effusion, without change since the recent radiograph of
[**3173-4-10**], but new compared to [**3172-9-1**] radiograph.
Parenchymal opacities in the right middle and lower lobes
adjacent to the effusion may relate to areas of atelectasis or
contusion. There is no left pleural effusion. The heart is upper
limits of normal in size. The aorta is tortuous, and the
pulmonary vascularity is normal. Upon comparison to the
[**3172-9-1**] radiograph, apparent elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm is thought to be due to a subpulmonic component of
the pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: No short interval change in moderate-to-large
loculated right pleural effusion. Considering history of recent
trauma, this raises a concern for hemothorax. Adjacent
parenchymal opacities in the right middle lobe may relate to
atelectasis or contusion.
.
[**3173-4-11**] CT chest w/o contrast:
Moderate to large left effusion with loculation. Measures low
attenuation fluid density. Consolidation with air bronchograms
in right lung also, likely pneumonia versus contusion.
.
Abd KUB [**3173-4-11**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intestinal obstruction. No hernia is
identified
on this single AP projection. A lateral radiograph would be
useful to assess
for presence of abdominal wall hernia.
.
EKG: NSR, RAD, IVCD, no ST changes, intervals normal (of note,
on prior EKG there was LAD present)

[**3173-4-20**] CXR
INDICATION: 80-year-old woman status post VATS, decortication
for loculated pleural effusion, chest tubes removed. Assess
effusion, loculation.

CHEST, TWO VIEWS: Comparison is made to a prior study of
[**3173-4-18**].

The heart size is in the upper limits of normal. The mediastinal
and hilar contours are unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature
is normal. There is some scarring in the left lower lobe and a
loculated right pleural effusion is again noted. This is
unchanged in comparison to the prior study.

IMPRESSION: No change in the loculated right pleural effusion.
.
[**3173-4-18**] Video Oropharyngeal Swallow
FINDINGS: Fluoroscopic guidance was provided to the speech and
swallowing pathologist. Barium of various consistencies was
administered. Premature spillover was identified. There was
moderate-to-severe residue, in the valleculae more than the
piriform sinuses. The right side was more severely affected than
the left. Penetration was identified both with nectar-thickened
as well as with thin liquids. When the patient swallowed thin
liquids, followed by pudding, there was a moderate amount of
aspiration identified due to residue in the piriform sinus. This
was subsequently followed by an ineffective cued cough.

IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate aspiration after the swallowing of thin liquids,
followed by pudding.
2. Penetration with both thin and nectar-thickened liquids.
3. Moderate-to-severe residue in the valleculae and piriform
sinuses as well as premature spillover
.
[**3173-4-19**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.
2. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
4. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
EMG [**3173-4-20**]
IMPRESSION:

Essentially normal study. The electrophysiologic findings do not
support a
pre- or postsynaptic disorder of neuromuscular transmission. The
findings do
not support a generalized myopathy or generalized disorder of
motor neurons.
.
[**3173-4-23**] MRI Brain
FINDINGS: There is mild prominence of the ventricles and sulci
consistent with age-related involutional change. No
abnormalities are identified on diffusion-weighted images to
indicate acute brain ischemia. There is no mass effect, shift of
normally midline structures or hydrocephalus. Susceptibility
artifacts are present indicating prior hemorrhage. A small old
infarct within the left cerebellar hemisphere is unchanged from
prior study. The expected flow voids of the basal cisterns
appear unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Stable mild brain atrophy. No evidence of cortical
infarct, mass effect or hydrocephalus.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 83 year old female s/p fall 3 weeks PTA who presented with
cough, right sided pain and CXR demonstrating PNA with large
effusion.
.
# PNA/Effusion -
The patient is an 80 year old female with cerebral palsy, HTN,
hypothyroid, PAF, osteoporosis here s/p mech fall on R side 3
weeks ago (no head or neck trauma) who presented with 3 days of
nonproductive cough, low grade fever, leukocytosis and a CXR
that shows new R pleural effusion concerning for hemothorax
versus paraneumonic effusion.  CT scan showed large loculated
effusion on the right.  Thoracentesis performed and was
exudative, thought to be parapneumonic effusion.  Patient went
to VATS on [**3173-4-13**] for decortication and drainage, and recieved 2
chest tubes.
.
Post op course complicated by hypercarbia and acidosis, and
patient required BIPAP and neosynephrine for a short period of
time.  Urine culture grew out vanc sensitive enterococcus, and
vancyomycin was started.  The patient's SOB improved and the
chest tubes were present for approx 3 days and removed without
any complications.  CXR showed improved effusion, but not
completely resolved.  She was treated with levofloxacin and
flagyl for CAP and aspiration PNA, as well as vancomycin for
enterococcus sensitive UTI.  Culture data showed GPC in prs and
clusters but did not grow anything (see results section).
Urinary legionella was negative.  The patient did well and had
no further respiratory compromise.  Thoracic surgery did not
recommend repeating the CT while inpatient, and they would
follow up with her as an outpatient.  Will plan to treat with
four weeks of antibiotics, with D1 [**3173-4-11**].  WBC decreased from
22 on admission to 16 on discharge.  The day prior to d/c WBC
was 14.8, so this should be repeated at rehabilitation facility
to make sure it does not continue to rise.
.
# Oral and Pharyngeal Dysphagia - Patient has had progressive
dysphagia since 2 days PTA.  Dysphagia started 9 years ago after
intubation for blood loss s/t GYN surgery, but it worsening
priot to admission and while in-house.  Speech and swallow
evaluated the patient with barium study and videooropharyngeal
swallow and found significant aspiration as well as oral and
pharygeal dysfuction in a pattern suggestive of neurologic
process.  Neurology was consulted and did not feel that the
dysfunction was d/t cerebral palsy and was not d/t another
primary neurologic disorder.  However, this was further worked
up with an EMG which was negative (see results section) and MRI
brain which showed no acute or old infarcts to correlate with
dysphagia.  Patient and family are very concerned about
underlying cause, but currently there is not clear
understanding.  Speech and swallow worked with patient
extensively to teach techniques to reduce aspiration.  Patient
and family were hesitant to PEG, but calorie counts were
performed x 3 days which demonstrated that patient only had 50%
of calories and 40% of protein required to sustain current
weight.  PEG was placed by GI and tubefeedings were initiated.
Patient currently at goal with only complication minor
intermittent pain with movement.  Patient may take small amounts
of pureed nectar and ground foods for pleasure.  Plan for repeat
video swallow prior to d/c from rehab.
.
# UTI - Found to have vancomycin sensitive enterococcus and
treated with 7 days of vancomycin.
.
# HTN - Initially hypertensive on admission, hypotensive s/p
VATS, transient asymptomatic episodes of hyposention (SBP 80's),
currently normotensive.  Maintained only on low dose beta
blocker for episodes of SVT.
.
# PAF - Patient is rhythm controlled with amiodarone, not
anticoagulated. Remained in NSR throughout hospitalization with
intermittent episodes of asymptomatic AVRT.  Cariology consulted
and recommeneded continuing amiodarone and considering EP
consult if episodes prolonged or if patient became symptomatic
(not done).  Low dose BB was added, uptitrated but caused 2 sec
pause and episode of a.m. bradycardia, so now on 12.5 mg PO in
a.m. only, and tolerating well.  Should have cariology f/u to
determine if BB needed.
.
# Cerebral Palsy - Present since birth and followed by
neurology. Stable while in-house. Continued on valium for muscle
spasms.
.
# Osteoporosis - Continued on calcium and vit D. Stopped fosamax
as needs to be taken whole and patient at aspiration risk.
.
# Pain - No pain until PEG placed.  Controlled effectively with
MSO4 and tylenol.
.
# Anxiety - Started on low dose buspar with improvement in
anxiety.
.
# Hypothyroidism  - Continued synthroid at home dose.
.
# PPX - SQ hep, PPI, aggressive bowel regimen
.
# Code - Full
