TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:  RV pacemaker lead malfunction
   HPI:
   75 year old female with h/o cardiac arrest while vacationing in [**Country **].
   Had ICD placement in [**2669**], placement of a new RV lead in [**2670**] because
   of diaphragmatic pacing, second arrest in [**2670**] in the setting of Biaxin
   administration, generator replacement in [**1-/2674**], presented for RV
   pacing lead extraction after RV impedence increased to 1000 ohms last
   week.  Found to have fractured lead.
   Cardiac arrest occurred while she was vacationing in [**Location (un) 7595**] in [**2670**]
   in the setting of drinking large quantities of tonic water (quinine).
   She had 5 separate episodes of "arrest" prior to ICD placement in
   Malaga. The patient had another arrest in the US in the setting of
   Biaxin administration.  Pacemaker placed in [**Country **].  No episodes of
   cardiac arrests since placement in [**2670**].
   The patient had normal device checks in device clinic until last month
   when she was found to have elevated impedence of [**2566**] 0hms in RV lead.
   Later readings were normal. However, 1.5 weeks ago whe called clinic
   because her pacemaker was "beeping" and was found to have impedence of
   100 ohms on [**Male First Name (un) 7596**] transmission. It was determined that she required a
   new lead.
   Procedure performed this AM.  ICD and pacemaker lead from [**2669**] were
   removed (atrial lead still in place).  New ICD lead placed today under
   general anesthesia.  The patient had 250cc of blood loss during the
   procedure and was mildly hypotensive.   0.5-0.8cm pericardial effusion
   present during procedure- no change in size.  Admitted to CCU.  Upon
   transfer, patient stable with vitals signs as follows: T- 98, P- 97,
   BP- 128/62, RR- 14, SaO2- 100% on NC
