Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 15035**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia, tachypnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis [**2897-4-28**]
Fine needle aspiration of axillary node [**2897-4-23**]


History of Present Illness:
She is a 58-year-old [**Last Name (un) 15479**] resident with mental retardation,
COPD, and no reported past cardiac history who presents for
examination of distended belly, anemia and noted to have large
pericardial effusion. Given mental retardation, interview with
patient is extremely limited, and pt. minimally able to report
symptoms. Pt. was admitted to [**Hospital3 7831**] after ECHO for workup
of shortness of breath revealed moderate pericardial effusion
without tamponade. Repeat ECHO 24h later showed
stable-to-improved effusion and was discharged with plans for
f/u ECHO in 14d.
.
Today, she presented to ED from NH with short episode hypoxia
with recovered with albuterol and 02 and started on
levofloxacin. also had KUB given some abdominal distension which
reportedly was concerning for ileus. she was transferred to
[**Hospital1 22**] for evaluation of a distended belly in setting of previous
volvulus. In ED, she had a distended abd with minimal TTP,
normal LFTs, pancreatic enzymes, without leukocytosis. She was
guaiac negative with VSS and received Abdominal CT shich showed
large pericardial effusion and presacral, perihepatic fluid, but
no acute abdominal process. Given large pericardial effusion
without previous comparisons, pt. was admitted for planned f/u
ECHO in the AM.
.
Spoke with pt.'s brother and wife who report that 8 weeks ago,
she started to become pale, have increased shallow breathinig,
low grade temps to 100-101, with some abdominal distension that
has been ongoing. Concern for GERD, COPD, UTI, all diagnosed
within this time period. UTI tx. with levaquin.
she has had no bloody or black stools per family until she
starte Fe So4.

Pertinent Results:
Echocardiogram [**2897-4-16**]
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is a moderate to large sized circumferential pericardial
effusion. Stranding is visualized within the pericardial space
c/w organization. There is substantial right atrial collapse and
brief diastolic invagination of the right ventricular outflow
tract (cine loops #15 and #28), consistent with low filling
pressures or early tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Moderate-to-large pericardial effusion with
echocardiographic findings of early tamponade.
.
CT chest, abdomen & pelvis W/CONTRAST [**2897-4-22**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse lymphadenopathy in the axillary, supraclavicular and
mediastinal regions. Pulmonary nodules in the left lung apex is
also noted. This is concerning for a neoplastic process.
Differential diagnosis includes primary lymphoma or lung
neoplasm.
2. Small pericardial effusion, decreased in size.
3. Bilateral small pleural effusions.
4. Splenic hypodensity.
5. Multiple hepatic subcentimeter hypodensities which are too
small to characterize.
6. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
7. Diffuse colonic distention up to 12.2 cm. No evidence of
obstruction.
.
Pericardial fluid:
Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to
optimize lymphocyte yield. CD45-bright, low-side scatter
lymphoid cells comprise 23% of total analyzed events. Of these,
B cells comprise approximately 15% of lymphoid-gated events and
do not express aberrant antigens.  Surface immunoglobulin
expression is extremely dim-to-absent, precluding evaluation of
clonality. T cells comprise approximately 80% of lymphoid gated
events, express mature lineage antigens, and have a
helper-cytotoxic ratio of 5.0. Natural killer cells represent
approximately 3% of lymphoid gated events. No expansion of
CD34-immunoreactive events are identified in the "blast gate".
Monocytic cells comprise 6% of total analyzed events.
.
Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic
immunophenotypic features of involvement by a
lymphoproliferative disorder are not seen in specimen.
Correlation with clinical findings and morphology (see 08-[**Numeric Identifier 27806**])
is recommended.  Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect
all lymphomas due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample
preparation.
.
L axillary lymph node FNA
Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to
optimize lymphocyte yield. B cells comprise approximately 9% of
lymphoid-gated events, are polyclonal, and do not express
aberrant antigens.T cells comprise approximately 89% of lymphoid
gated events and express mature lineage antigens (CD2,3,5,7).
.
Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic
immunophenotypic features of involvement by non-Hodgkin B-cell
lymphoma are not seen in specimen.  Review of cytospin slide
(1096V-[**4-24**]) shows predominantly blood with admixed lymphocytes
and numerous degenerated cells precluding definitive morphologic
assessment.  Correlation with clinical findings and morphology
is recommended.  Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect
all lymphomas due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample
preparation.

Brief Hospital Course:
58 yo F with mental retardation & h/o volvulus s/p colonic
resection admitted with hypoxia & abdominal distention, also
repeat echocardiogram given newly diagnosed pericardial
effusion.
.
# Pericardial Effusion: s/p pericardiocentesis when early signs
of tamponade seen on echocardiogram. Bloody pericardial effusion
~510cc's removed, ?malignancy. However no evidence of malignancy
cells seen on flow cytometry as well as cytology. W/u already
started at [**Hospital6 **] and so far studies negative
except for elevated ESR, CRP & CA 125. Required overnight CCU
stay after pericardial drain placed. Developed afib with RVR
during stay. No evidence of reaccumulation of fluid seen on
repeat echocardiogram or vital signs including nml pulsus.
.
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: ?r/t pericardial effusion,
worsened after pericardiocentesis during which time she stayed
in the CCU given pericardial drain. She was treated with IV
metoprolol, diltiazem then finally started on an emsolol drip
for good control. This was weaned off with the onset of
Verapamil which was uptitrated during stay. Metoprolol was also
added for better rate control. The decision was made for no
anticoagulation given bloody pericardial effusion, pt was
continued on full strength aspirin.
.
# CT findings: Diffuse lymphadenopathy in the axillary,
supraclavicular and mediastinal regions with pulmonary nodules
in the left lung apex which were concering for neoplastic
process. Pt underwent L axillary lymph node biopsy for concern
of malignancy, ?Lung CA, lymphoma vs. other other cancers.
However, pathology was not diagnostic. Pt with no prior
colonoscopies or vaginal exams, however with nml mammograms &
per report, last [**1-/2897**] nml. Guaiac negative stools during
admission. Pt will need outpt evaluation for excisional lymph
node biopsy vs mediastinoscopy for tissue diagnosis, if desired
by the family.
.
# Abdominal distension: Appeared to be chronic, however worsened
acutely during admission. No evidence of volvulus, cholecystitis
or obstruction; imaging showed significant amounts of air with
colonic distention, likely colonic ileus. Surgery was consulted
and recommended endoscopic decompression per GI. However, GI
recommended rectal tube placement with was effective in
decompressing her abdomen. Pt initially made NPO, however
resumed regular diet gradually. had no episodes of nausea or
vomiting, however it was difficult to access abdominal pain. Per
GI, pt will require intermittent decompression with rectal tube
until ileus resolves. Also given possibility of malignancy, it's
recommended that pt under colonoscopy as part of further workup.

.
# Microcytic anemia: c/w anemia of chronic disease; low retic
count, however hematocrit stable. Guaiac negative stool x 1 in
the ED. We continued iron supplementation, ?other stools
guaiac'ed.
.
# Peripheral edema: Unclear if new, no evidence of chronic
venous stasis and no significant ascites seen on CT despite
abdominal distention. No evidence of proteinuria, however
sl.lower albumin. ?heart failure, however no other evidence on
PE. Liver function appears nml.
.
# Neurodermatitis: continued topicals
# DJD: continued celecoxib & tylenol.
