HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58-year-old
male with a history of coronary artery disease status post
multiple myocardial infarctions and a ventricular
fibrillation arrest in [**3437-9-26**], who presented as a
transfer from an outside hospital for evaluation for cardiac
catheterization and/or ICD placement following a ventricular
fibrillation arrest.

The patient initially presented to the outside hospital
complaining of two weeks of shortness of breath, wheezing,
dyspnea on exertion, chest pain and lower extremity edema.

On [**3438-8-25**], the patient was admitted to [**Hospital 1794**]
Hospital after worsening chest pain times one hour.  On
admission the patient's troponin was 0.26, and on hospital
day #1, his blood pressure dropped, and suffered a
ventricular fibrillation arrest requiring a code that lasted
greater than one hour.

The patient was intubated and started on Amiodarone and
required Levophed and epinephrine drips.  His Intensive Care
Unit course was complicated by ATN with a peak creatinine of
5.8 requiring dialysis with questionable rhabdomyolysis and
CKs reaching 14,000, fever, C-diff colitis, and worsening
sacral decubitus ulcers.

The patient's mental status improved.  The patient was
uneventfully extubated four days prior to transfer.  The
patient was then transferred to [**Hospital6 3127**] for cardiac catheterization and possible AICD
placement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Coronary artery disease status post
myocardial infarction in [**3425**], [**3432**], [**3433**], and [**3436**], with
catheterization in [**3437-9-26**] showing an ejection fraction
of 40%, with inferior-posterior basal hypokinesis.  It showed
a left main with 20% stenosis, proximal left anterior
descending with 60% stenosis, proximal circumflex with 80%
stenosis, midcircumflex with 30%, OM2 100%, OM3 100%, status
post stent to the proximal circumflex through a radial artery
approach.  2.  History of ventricular fibrillation arrest,
now times two, status post pacemaker placement.  3.

Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm.  On [**8-16**], after
the arrest, with PR prolongation, T-wave inversions in II,
III and AVF, Q in I and AVL, Qs in V2-V6.

On [**8-25**], electrocardiogram showed intermittently paced
atrial beats per minute.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 99??????, blood
pressure 90/47, pulse 73, respirations 20, oxygen saturation
97% on 4 L, fingerstick 150.  General:  Obese male, lying
upright 45?????? in bed, uncomfortable.  He stated he had pain
from his sacrum.  HEENT:  Extraocular movements intact.
Jugular venous distention could not be assessed secondary to
obesity.  There were no bruits.  Right IJ was nontender.
Heart:  Very distant heart sounds.  There were no murmurs,
rubs, or gallops.  Could not heart S1 or S2.  Lungs:
Diffusely decreased breath sounds throughout.  There was some
rhonchi anteriorly with inspiration.  There were no crackles.
Suboptimal exam.  Abdomen:  Morbidly obese.  Soft and
nontender.  Positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  There was
[**1-29**]+ pitting edema, 1+ dorsalis pedis bilaterally.  There was
skin blanching 1 mm maculars ................ on abdomen that
were nontender.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular:  A.  Ischemia:  With a
positive troponin upon admission to the outside hospital and
the history of his prior ventricular fibrillation arrest
occurring in the setting of ischemia, it was felt that the
patient's most recent ventricular fibrillation arrest was
again secondary to ischemia.

The plan was for cardiac catheterization once his other acute
issues including C-diff colitis and recent acute renal
failure were adequately resolved.  The patient was continued
on his Aspirin, Plavix, and Lipitor.  Low blood pressure
limited the use of beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors early in
the patient's course.

On approximately hospital day #8, the patient underwent
cardiac catheterization.  This revealed three blockages in
the patient's left anterior descending of 90%, proximal, mid
and distal.  All three underwent stenting.  The patient's
hemodynamic numbers showed a wedge of 26, pulmonary vascular
resistance of 76, SVR 800, cardiac output of 6.3, cardiac
index of 2.4.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

Postcatheterization the patient was with improvement in
feelings of lethargy and improvement in his blood pressure,
allowing the addition of Captopril, as well as Lopressor and
eventual titration of the doses.

B.  Pump:  Due to the patient's obesity, exam was extremely
limited on assessing the patient's fluid status; however, the
patient had a 4 L oxygen requirement and was severely
orthopneic with 2-3+ pitting edema.  The patient was diuresed
aggressively.  Initially hypotension limited the use of
diuretics; therefore, low-dose Dopamine was started.  The
patient's blood pressure responded well, and so Lasix was
added.

The patient then diuresed well on Dopamine.  The patient was
negative [**2-27**] Lungs.  After hospital day #5, Dopamine was
discontinued, and the patient maintained a good blood
pressure in the low 100s systolic.  There was a decrease in
his orthopnea, as well as improvement in his oxygen
saturations with a reduced oxygen requirement.

Echocardiogram was obtained which was very limited secondary
to the patient's body habitus.  This showed an estimated
ejection fraction of 35-40% with hypokinesis of the inferior
wall.

Postcardiac catheterization the patient was aggressively
diuresed for another two days secondary to the high wedge, as
well as the fluid given for the catheterization.  Again the
patient was negative another 4 L with further improvement in
oxygen saturations, eventually with an oxygen saturation of
94% on room air.

As mentioned, beta-blocker was titrated up, eventually
changing to Toprol XL, as well as the ACE inhibitor dose
increased as tolerated.  The patient then underwent a nuclear
study RVG for a better estimation of his ejection fraction.
Echocardiogram was not a good study.  The RVG showed an
excellent ejection fraction of 59% with normal wall motion
and normal cavity sizes.  The patient was felt to be
compensated from a congestive heart failure standpoint, and
Lasix was changed to a p.o. dose.

C.  Rhythm:  The patient was transferred initially for the
question of ICD placement; however, it was felt that his
ventricular fibrillation arrest occurred in the setting of
ischemia.  Therefore after revascularization following his
catheterization, it was felt that there was not an indication
for ICD placement, unless the patient had a low ejection
fraction.  Therefore, the RVG was done to get an accurate
estimation, and when the ejection fraction came back at 59%
with normal wall motion, the decision was made to forego on
the ICD placement.

Throughout the hospital stay, the patient was continued on
Amiodarone 400 mg b.i.d. with no further episodes of
ventricular arrhythmias.  The patient did undergo some
additional tests, including a signal-average
electrocardiogram which was recorded as positive, as well as
a T-wave .................. test which was recorded as
nondiagnostic.

At the time of discharge, it was felt that the ventricular
fibrillation arrests were in the setting of acute ischemia,
and with a normal ejection fraction, no ICD was warranted.

2.  C-diff colitis:  The patient was positive for C-diff with
a white count in the 30s at the outside hospital.  He was
transferred here on Vancomycin and Flagyl IV.  This regimen
was changed to Flagyl 500 t.i.d. p.o.  The patient was
treated for a 10-day course with improvement in his diarrhea
and decrease in his white count to normal.

3.  Other infectious disease issues:  The patient had an
increase in his white count back up to 16.  There was no
clear etiology.  The patient did have a right IJ that had
been placed on [**9-5**] at the outside hospital.  This
was the only access the patient had.  A peripheral line could
not be obtained.  There was no erythema or tenderness around
the line.  The patient did not appear septic.  Blood cultures
were drawn off the line and showed no growth.

A urine culture did come back positive for fungal.  The
patient had a Foley placed secondary to obstructive uropathy.
At the time of this dictation, the patient's Foley was going
to be removed, and a repeat urinalysis would be sent.

The patient also had a sacral decubitus ulcers which was
thought to possibly contribute to his white count.  Please
see section on this issue.

4.  Summary of hospital course:  At the time of this
dictation, there was no clear etiology for the increased
white count, and this is to be followed as an outpatient or
at rehabilitation.

5.  Sacral decubitus ulcers:  The patient was with two large
necrotic-looking decubitus ulcers.  Plastic Surgery was
consulted.  They described the ulcers as being on the
buttocks.  The left side was a 10 x 15 cm lesion, dark green
brown, no sensation to light touch.  The border was raw and
slightly darker red and 2 cm wide.

On the right, there was a smaller lesion of similar nature,
about 6 x 3 cm.  Plastic Surgery felt that these appeared to
be dry eschar, probably second degree ulcers and recommended
that there was no need for debridement.  They felt that the
ulcers were likely to heal with conservative care.

Later in the patient's course, when his white count
increased, Plastic Surgery was reconsulted, and they again
felt that the decubitus ulcers were not responsible for the
increased white count and did not necessitate debridement.

6.  Obstructive sleep apnea:  The patient is set for OSA with
................. obesity.  The patient was encouraged to try
CPAP at night.  Both ventricular fibrillation arrests
occurred at night which was thought possibly secondary to
hypoxia initiating the ischemia; however, the patient could
not tolerate a CPAP secondary to claustrophobia.

A Pulmonary consult was considered; however, the patient
vastly improved after diuresis with improvement in his
orthopnea with no further events.

7.  Diabetes:  The patient's blood sugars were not
controlled.  The patient's NPH was titrated upward, and upon
this dictation, sugars were improved.

8.  Deconditioning:  Physical Therapy evaluated the patient
and felt that he necessitated a rehabilitation stay.

The remainder of the [**Hospital **] hospital course, as well as
the discharge diagnosis, discharge medications, and discharge
instructions will be dictated in an addendum to this
dictation.
