Admission Date: [**2626-2-20**]        Discharge Date: [**2626-3-24**]

Date of Birth:  [**2602-2-7**]        Sex:  F

Service:  HEPATOBILIARY SURGERY SERVICE


DIAGNOSIS:  Bile duct injury/obstruction, status post
laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

The patient is a 24 year old female status post laparoscopic
cholecystectomy on [**2626-2-15**], at outside hospital who
presented with jaundice and elevated total bilirubin level,
ERCP performed at [**Hospital1 37**]
demonstrating a single short stricture seen at the common
hepatic duct, distal to the hilum. There was moderate
postobstructive dilation. Surgical clips were in the area
concerning for clip across common hepatic duct. These
findings are compatible with postcholecystectomy injury and
obstruction. A 12 cm x 10 French plastic biliary stent was
placed successfully into the left intrahepatic bile duct.
There was normal pancreatic duct.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  High blood pressure.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy on
[**2626-2-15**].

MEDICATIONS:  On admission, none.

ALLERGIES:  OxyContin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is afebrile, vital signs
stable. No acute distress. Lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally. CVS: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.
Abdomen: Obese, nontender, nondistended, but soft.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was kept NPO. On [**2626-2-21**], a HIDA scan was performed demonstrating likely
persistent bile leakage. Labs that morning, [**2626-2-21**],
were the following: WBC of 2.9, hematocrit of 33.3, platelets
406,000. Sodium 133, potassium 3.3, chloride 95, bicarbonate
23, BUN 3, creatinine 0.7, glucose 156. AST 137, ALT 292,
alkaline phosphatase 930, amylase 1649 and lipase 3905. INR
1.2. On [**2626-2-21**], the patient had an ultrasound of
her hypoechoic fluid collection in the gallbladder fossa
measuring 65 x 31 x 32. Fluid collection in the gallbladder
fossa could not be accessed by ultrasound via submucosal
approach. The patient was brought to the CT scanner for
pigtail catheter placement. The same day the patient did have
a CT guided placement of an 8 French [**Last Name (un) 2423**] catheter in the
subhepatic fluid collection. On [**2626-2-22**], the patient
had decreased pain, afebrile, vital signs stable. Total
bilirubin had decreased. Drain had put out 75 cc. On [**2626-2-22**], the patient had an ultrasound of the abdomen
demonstrating patent hepatic venous and pleural venous system
with flow in the appropriate direction. Normal Doppler
arterial waveform in the liver. There was no significant
residual fluid seen in the gallbladder fossa after placement
of a drainage catheter and no free fluid seen in the abdomen.
On [**2626-2-22**], the patient went to interventional
radiology for a right-sided percutaneous transhepatic
cholangiography which was unsuccessful after multiple
attempts. Left-sided intrahepatic biliary tree is not
dilated. Contrast passes from the left-sided biliary tree
through the stent into the bowel. The patient had a NG placed
on admission, continued to be NPO. Positive flatus on [**2626-2-24**]. On [**2626-2-24**], her labs that day were the
following: WBC of 16.8, hematocrit of 23.9, platelets
263,000. Sodium 139, potassium 3.0, chloride 101, bicarbonate
30, BUN 6 and creatinine 0.6 with a glucose of 90. Amylase
and lipase had decreased significantly to 424 and 444. AST
was 49, ALT 106, alkaline phosphatase 416. INR was 1.4. The
decreased hematocrit prompted a CT abdomen and pelvis to be
obtained which demonstrated active bleeding from the anterior
liver causing a large hematoma in the right upper quadrant
with extension of the hematoma into the pelvis. There was
evidence of mass backed by the hematoma displacing the liver
more centrally. There was fluid around the tail of the
pancreas which may be consistent with the patient's history
of pancreatitis. Biliary catheter is seen in the porta
hepatis. No significant fluid collection in the gallbladder
fossa. There is a small left pleural effusion and
atelectasis. Urgent angiogram was performed of the liver
demonstrating superselective angiogram of the hepatic
arteries demonstrating an area of acute extravasation in the
anterior segment of the right lobe of the liver. There was
successful coiling of the bleeding vessel using two 0.018/0.5
cm straight coils. Of note, during her hospitalization, the
patient had episodes of aggressive behavior where she would
suck her thumb, infantile speech, would not get out of bed.
The patient was placed on Unasyn since the time of admission
on [**2-20**], when she received 3 mg IV q.6 and eventually
finished a 16 day course of antibiotics which was
discontinued on [**2626-3-7**]. On [**2626-2-28**], the
patient had a CT abdomen and pelvis demonstrating interval
development of a large geographic area of hypodensity in the
right hepatic lobe. Given the recent hepatic artery
embolization, this is reasonable for hepatic necrosis or
developing abscess. Parenchymal hematoma is also less likely.
There is no evidence of active contrast extravasation.
Decrease in the amount of perihepatic abdominal and pelvic
fluid. There was a small left pleural effusion. Since the
patient was NPO, the patient had been started on TPN. She was
at goal. Social work was consulted. Foley was in place
throughout this early hospitalization. The patient was out of
bed walking with physical therapy. Nutrition was consulted
and made recommendations on TPN. On [**2626-3-6**], the
patient had an ERCP demonstrating the previous stent placed
in the biliary duct was found in the major papilla. This was
removed. The postcholecystectomy structure was seen in the
common hepatic duct. There was moderate postobstructive
dilatation. Left intrahepatic ductal system was dilated as
well as compared to the branches seen in the right system.
The forceful injection was performed and the patient was
rotated for optimal visualization, appeared we were in fact
viewing both a nondilated right and a moderately dilated left
system. No biliary leak was seen. A 12 cm x 10 French Contin
[**Doctor Last Name 2750**] biliary stent was placed successfully in the left main
hepatic duct. On [**2626-3-7**], the patient continued to
be afebrile, vital signs stable with WBC of 8.8, hematocrit
of 31.0, platelets 322,000. Sodium 134, potassium 4.3,
chloride 102, bicarbonate 24, BUN 15, creatinine 0.6, and
glucose of 95. AST was 132, ALT 279, alkaline phosphatase
492, total bilirubin 1.9 which had decreased significantly.
Amylase and lipase 221 and 137 which was also decreased. On
[**2626-3-13**], the patient went to the OR for an end to
side roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy over a 5 French feeding
tube; evacuation of subcapsular hematoma performed by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 679**]. Please see operative note from
[**2626-3-13**], for more details about the operation.
Postoperatively, the patient had an epidural for pain
control. On [**2626-3-15**], the patient had a T-max of
102.2, had  NG tube continued to be in place, good urine
output, T tube put out 270. The patient had 2 J-P drains, one
put out 270 and the other 10. Her labs that day were WBC of
12.8, hematocrit of 24.1, platelets 295,000. Sodium 133,
potassium 3.9, chloride 101, bicarbonate 26, BUN 11 and
creatinine 0.5, glucose 121. AST was 110, ALT 199, alkaline
phosphatase 242, total bilirubin 1.3. Temperature was worked
up which included a UA, UC, blood cultures which were all
unremarkable. The patient was transfused blood for a
hematocrit of 24.1. The patient was placed on vancomycin
postoperatively and received a total of 8 days of vancomycin
1 gram IV q.12. At discharge, physical therapy was
reconsulted. On [**2626-3-16**], epidural catheter was
removed. Tip was intact. There were no complications. The
patient was placed on IV medications for pain control. The
patient continued to be NPO, continued on TPN. The patient
was out of bed. Fingersticks were within range of 105 to 139.
On [**2626-3-20**], the patient had a T-tube cholangiogram
demonstrating gravity T-tube cholangiogram demonstrating
emptying of contrast into the jejunum. There is dilation of
the left hepatic duct as noted, unchanged compared to the
ERCP on [**2626-3-6**]. On [**2626-3-21**], the patient's
diet was advanced. Continued to ambulate well with physical
therapy and physical therapist thought that she could go
home, that it would be safe for her to go home. On [**2626-3-23**], CT abdomen and pelvis was performed because of
persistent nausea and vomiting which demonstrated no evidence
of bowel obstruction or other acute gastrointestinal
pathology. Decrease in size of intrahepatic subcapsular
collection. There was a 5.9 x 4.6 x 3.4 cm focus in the
gallbladder fossa of low attenuation mixed with air. This may
represent surgical packing, however, an abscess could not be
excluded. So the patient was receiving Keflex for a small
area of her incision that was possible infection. After
receiving the CAT scan and speaking with the patient, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 679**] felt that all unnecessary medications should be stopped
which included antibiotic Keflex, which she had been treated
with 1 day of Keflex. Protonix was discontinued. Dilaudid was
discontinued. On [**2626-3-24**], the patient was on no
antibiotics. She had no overnight events. She was afebrile
and vital signs were stable. Blood sugars were excellent.
Weight was 68.9 kilograms, relatively good [**Name (NI) **] and O's. Urine
output was good. Labs on the 24th, were the following: WBC of
9.5, hematocrit of 26.8, platelets 336,000. Sodium 134,
potassium 4.3, chloride 99, bicarbonate 26, BUN 11 and
creatinine 0.7, and glucose 71. Calcium, phosphorus and
magnesium were 9.0, 4.5, 1.8. AST 38, ALT 113, alkaline
phosphatase 350. So at that point, the patient was only
taking Tylenol p.r.n. The patient was discharged to home with
physical therapy and VNA. She went home on the following
medications: Tylenol 325 mg 1-2 tabs q.4-6hours p.r.n. and
Dilaudid 2 mg 1 tablet every 8 hours p.r.n. if needed. The
patient is to call transplant surgery immediately at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5508**] if any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, increased
abdominal pain, any redness around her PTC catheter which was
capped.

MAJOR SURGICAL INVASIVE PROCEDURES:
1.  [**2626-2-20**], endoscopic retrograde
    cholangiopancreatography.
2.  [**2626-2-23**], unsuccessful attempted right sided
    percutaneous transhepatic angiography despite multiple
    attempts.
3.  [**2626-2-24**], superselective angiogram.
4.  [**2626-2-22**], CT guided placement of drain catheter.
5.  [**2626-2-28**], right IJ catheter in the superior vena
    cava.
6.  [**2626-3-11**], another endoscopic retrograde
    cholangiopancreatography.
7.  [**2626-3-13**], end to side roux-en-y
    hepaticojejunostomy over a 5 French feeding tube and
    evacuation of subcapsular hematoma. The patient
    postoperatively had 3 drains, 2 J-P drains and 1 T-tube.
    On postoperative day 2, one of the J-P drains were
    removed and on [**2626-3-20**], postoperative day 8,
    second J-P drain was removed. So the patient only has 1 T-
    tube which has been capped.
