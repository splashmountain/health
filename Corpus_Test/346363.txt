   Assessment and Plan
   68 y.o. female with CAD s/p 4 vessel CABG and follow-up stent of
   LIMA-LAD c/b instent stenosis with restenting as well as severe CHF, EF
   of 20-30% who presents after recent discharge with acute on chronic
   renal failure.
   .
   # CORONARIES: s/p CABG with stent of LIMA to LAD.
   - continue ASA, statin, Plavix, low dose BB.
   .
   # PUMP: Known, severe CHF, s/p ICD. Currently thought to be total body
   fluid overloaded but pt tolerating well (lungs clear, satting well,
   comfortable), so switched to PO lasix to keep even to neg.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Episode of bradycardia in setting of CHB. Evaluated by EP and
   pacer settings changed
 no further episodes
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Improving
   .
   # Asthma  - Continue Spiriva, albuterol, fluticasone
   .
   # Anemia/Myelodysplastic syndrome: At baseline
   - Transfuse as needed
   .
   # DM
   - Insulin SS w/ QID FS
   .
   # FEN   - Correct/Replete electrolytes PRN, no IVF, Diabetic/Cardiac
