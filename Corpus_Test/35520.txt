Tape #: 2009AW5-: Machine: AW5
Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  55%  >= 55%
Aorta - Annulus:  2.2 cm  <= 3.0 cm
Aorta - Ascending:  3.2 cm  <= 3.4 cm
TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP):  >= 17 mm Hg  <= 25 mm Hg

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity. No thrombus
in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%). Overall
normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Mild (1+)
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The rhythm appears
to be atrial fibrillation. Results were personally reviewed with
the MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.

The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation.

There is no pericardial effusion.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**2733-5-3**] at
1000am.

Post procedure the left atrial appendage has been ligated. There
is no residual stump seen.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] was admitted on [**5-2**] for IV haeparin and taken to the
OR on [**2733-5-3**] for mini MAZE and removal of left atrial appendage.
see operative note for details.
Post-operatively she was admitted to the CVICU intubated. On the
night of POD #0 -Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] self extubated without incident. Pain
control was an issue and was treated with narcotics, toradol and
ultimately a paravertebral block with good effect.
Her chest tubes were removed on POD #1 and she was transferred
to the floor. She was started on lopressor and diuresis. Ms.
[**Known patient lastname **] developed rapid afib and was treated w/ IV lopressor and
amiodarone. She converted to sinus rhythm. She was started on
coumadin. She was slow to progress with physical therapy and was
ultimately discharged to home on HD#4.
