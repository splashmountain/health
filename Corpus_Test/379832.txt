TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:  GI bleed
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   62F pmhx as detailed below presented w/ hypoxia and hypotension related
   to diarrhea admitted [**2861-3-8**] with decompensated Rt heart failure,
   profound DOE, stabilized in ICU developed ARF.  Had known PFO with
   presumed dynamic flow reversal, RHC on [**3-14**] no improvement with NO or
   Fi02 1.0.  [**3-27**] freq black tary bm, scoped found erosion GE junction,
   gastric and esoph erosions.  Started on PPI.  Perc PFO closure on [**3-30**]
   started on ASA, plavix.  Cont G+ stools, evolving into frank melena.
   EGD/colonoscopy today under GETA for control of hemodynamics given
   tenuous hemodyn status.  Extubated in PACU w/o event. Transferred to
   ICU for close monitoring.

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with GIB in setting of severe biventricular failure with recent
   correction of PFO now s/p EGD and colonoscopy under GETA extubated in
   PACU now in [**Hospital Unit Name 42**] for close hemodyn monitoring.  Two regions in colon
   with oozing c/w source of bleeding, also bleeding lesion noted in
   duodenum all lesion clipped w/ good hemostasis achieved.
   GI bleed -
   - setting of aspirin and plavix for PFO placement
   - Cardiology consulted re: anticoag - feels need to continue treatement
   given risk of coagulation in setting of PFO s/p occlusive device
   - serial hct
   - hemodynamically stable
   - check ekg
   - maintain 2 preriph IV
   - cont PPI
   - GI following
   Anemia secondary to blood loss
   - transfuse to hct of 30
   CHF - biventricular
   -lasix and diuril drips on hold secondary to bleeding
   -careful fluid balance, follow sats
   Respiratory
   -extubated successfully in PACU.  Still requiring 5LNC
   -cont close monitoring respiratory status
   Acute on Chronic Renal failure
   -  renal following - consulted for ?UF
   Patient is critically ill with signficant threat of rebleed and
   significant anemia related to blood loss.  Time spent 40 minutes.
   Remainder of plan per resident note.
