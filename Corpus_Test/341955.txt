   Assessment and Plan
   56 y/o female with hyperlipidemia who presented with chest pain and
   found to have a STEMI [**1-28**] to an occluded LAD.
   .
   CARDIOGENIC SHOCK: Large anterior MI now s/p stenting of LAD. Cardiac
   index initially 1.3 indicative of cardiogenic shock and requiring
   IABP.
   - Continue IABP, following Q4 PA diastolic pressure and cardiac index
   - Goal PA diastolic pressure 15-20, Goal cardiac index [**1-30**]
   - Was tried on 1:2 with drop in SVO2 and MAP, so restarted 1:1, will
   try again today given improved PAD.
   - Pump waveforms consistent with good timing, will continue to montior
   - heparin gtt while on IABP
   - no beta-blocker, spironolactone, or ACE for now while on pump
   - ASA, statin, plavix
   - TEE today
   - Cardiac enzymes trending down
   - Daily EKGs, CXR for placement of IABP
   .
   IABP console discrepancy
 confirmed to be more accurate on telemetry
   monitor. Will discuss
   .
   RHYTHM: NSR currently. Monitor on telemetry.
   .
   TOBACCO ABUSE - Council about smoking cessation.
   .
   HYPERLIPIDEMIA - continue statin
   .
   LFT ELEVATION - Likely from cardiogenic shock.  Will continue to
   monitor LFTs to trend down.
   .
   FEN: NPO for now
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with Heparin gtt.
   -PPI
   CODE: full
   DISPO: Cardiology floor service for now
