   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9907**] is a 69 yo woman with ESRD/HD secondary to DM and HTN, CHF,
   afib, hx of TIA, presented to ED after syncopal episode.  In ED found
   to have prolonged QTc with episodes of symptomatic TdP.   ECG changes
   and troponin elevation while in CCU concerning for ACS versus ischemia
   from torsades.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Syncope is due to TdP. QT prolongation and TdP of unclear
   etiology. Unlikely to be purely medication-induced, given that
   citalopram has been d/c
ed for several days. Unlikely congenital QT
   syndrome given patient age and lack of syncope hx and normal QT prior
   to 2 wks ago. Currently in NSR, has hx of a-fib. Pt w/ two brief
   episodes of TdP that self resolved, during HD on [**10-19**].
   - will discontinue Celexa on discharge
   - continue potassium and magnesium repletion prn to K=4.5-5.0, Mg>2.5
   - consider isoproterenol and temp pacing if bradycardic or TdP recurs
   - keep on cardiac monitor
   - repeat EKG daily  to monitor prolonged QTc (620->537->488->469ms)
   - Per EP, not candidate for ICD placement
   - will restart warfarin today
   - consider starting mexiletine 200 mg q8h (f/u with EP regarding dose)
   - consider switching to verapamil ER 120 mg qdaily
   - f/u with EP regarding recs regarding outpatient monitoring
   - f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5068**] in one month
   .
   # PUMP:  TTE [**2677-10-19**] showed LVEF 20%. Extensive anterior, septal, and
   apical akinesis with moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation and at
   least mild mitral regurgitation; moderate aortic stenosis;
   mild-moderate aortic regurg; elevated left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg).  Hypotension [**3-5**] dehydration or overdiuresis during HD
   is possible (baseline SBP around 100). Pulmonary edema clinically and
   on CXR on [**10-18**].
   - continue verapamil (started [**10-23**])
   - no ACE-I due to ESRD
   - daily weights, I/O's
   .
   # CORONARIES: CE elevated - Peak Trop is 4.5, Peak CK 1044, MB 50 from
   [**10-19**] PM. Enzyme elevations could be due to ischemia from torsades vs.
   ACS. No ST elevation/depressions on EKG but anterior-septal Q
s c/w
   akinesis on echo. Patient denies any chest pain.  Dobutamine stress
   test in [**2676-8-1**] was normal per pt. Cath [**10-23**] showed 80% LAD lesion p
   1^st septal, D1 60%, mid-RCA 50%. DES placed in LAD.
   - continue ASA 325 mg
   - continue Plavix 75 mg
   - continue simvastatin 40 mg
   .
   # ESRD: Patient is on M/W/F dialysis via AV graft. Has been oliguric,
   creatinine 5.5, electrolytes stable.
   - continue to monitor electrolytes, BUN, Cr to trend renal function
   - will receive HD tomorrow at regular outpatient HD center (M/W/F
   schedule)
   - continue PhosLo and renal vitamins
   .
   # Nausea/vomiting: intermittent, has been ongoing issue at home. Could
   be [**3-5**] GERD vs. diabetic gastroparesis. Increased cough with meals is
   c/w GERD.
   - will hold off Zofran, H2RA, or Reglan for now due to concern for QT
   prolongation
   .
   # Hypothyroidism
   - TSH 1.0
   - continue levothyroxine at home dose
   .
   # DM2: not on any insulin or oral hypoglycemics at home.
   Well-controlled, BS<200s at home.
   - sliding-scale insulin for glycemic control
   .
   FEN:
   - Renal, cardiac prudent, low-sodium, diabetic diet.
   - will replete K+ PRN
   - also will replete Mg+ as above
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's, AV graft in L arm
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx
  heparin SQ
   -Pain management not necessary currently
   -Bowel regimen with docusate/senna

   COMM: Daughter [**Name2 (NI) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 9908**] home, ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 9909**] cell
   .
   DISPO: CCU for now, likely d/c to home today
