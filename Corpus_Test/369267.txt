   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o F with Hep C & ETOH cirrhosis who presented with 1 day of BRBPR
   and was found to have elevated anion gap, glucose 55 and ETOH level
   145.
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: Multiple possible etiologies for elevated gap.
   Lactate elevated at 4.4, ETOH level 145 with serum osms of 340, urine
   ketones positive.  Given h/o poor po intake, ETOH abuse and cirrhosis,
   suspect this is due alcoholic/starvation ketoacidosis.  Lactate
   improving after hydration.
   - received thiamine 100mg IV followed by dextrose for low BS
   - received banana bag followed by D5 1/2NS
   - continue D5 1/2NS until nutritional status improves
   - trend lactate and ABGs
   - monitor MS
   .
   # BRBPR: Pt underwent EGD in [**12-7**] that revealed gastritis &
   duodenitis, colonoscopy in [**9-7**] was normal.  Hct has been stable with
   IVF and HD stable.  Suspect that may be a slow bleed due to gastritis
   or possible hemorrhoids.  No frank melena on exam to suggest brisk
   upper GI bleed.  INR elevated at 2.1 on presentation in setting of GI
   bleed.
   - NPO for now, apprec GI recs
   - IV Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - typed and crossed for 2u prbcs
   - trend hct q6hrs, transfuse if acute hct drop or hct<21 (tx 1U PRBC on
   [**2-11**])
   - given thrombocytopenia and GI bleed, will trend plts
   - admin Vitamin K 10mg po x 3 days
   - PIV x 2
   .
   # ETOH level/withdrawl: Pt with poor nutrition status and long history
   of ETOH abuse. She denies h/o withdrawal and current ETOH level of
   145.  Will place on CIWA scale for now.  Required total of 4mg IV
   Ativan [**2-11**] PM.
   - CIWA scale
   - Ativan 1mg q2hr prn CIWA >10
   - Banana bag with MVI, folate, thiamine
   .
   # Cocaine Abuse: Pt with long history of substance abuse and tox screen
   + for cocaine.  Pt has a h/o NSTEMI in setting of cocaine abuse. Pt
   currently denying CP, EKGs unchanged from prior.
   - cardiac enzymes negative
   - monitor on telemetry
   - no aspirin given thrombocytopenia and GI bleed
   - SW consult in am
   .
   # Hypoglycemia: Pt reports poor po intake, concern for
   alcoholic/starvation ketoacidosis given elevated gap and low BS.
   - received thiamine 100mg IV to prevent Wernickes
   - dextrose [**1-2**] amp after thiamine
   -  D5 1/2NS IVF
   - hold on insulin regimen
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely due ETOH abuse, essentially at baseline.
   However, given GI bleed, would consider plt transfusion if dropping hct
   or plt count
   - transfuse 1u plts prn
   - f/u plt count
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now
   - s/p Thiamine 100mg IV, banana bag and D5 1/2NS
   - aggressive electrolyte repletion
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, PPI, bowel regimen
   .
   # Access: PIV x 2
