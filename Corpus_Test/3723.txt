Chief Complaint:
falls

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
RIJ

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 58 YO man with h/o PE (on coumadin), CAD, s/p L
BKA, who has had multiple recent mechanical falls (pt reports 15
falls over the past 5 days due to "right leg weakness"). He
presented to the ED s/p another fall today. Pt reports "I just
fell", but denies CP, SOB, LOC, or any pre-syncopal events. He
does say he hit his head on the ground. After he fell, he was
unable to get up and called his family. He was then taken to the
ED. No reports of seizure activity. No fevers, chills, N/V/D.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to have diffuse ecchymoses, INR > 22.8,
and hct of 28 (recent baseline 38.1). He underwent pan-CT, which
revealed only buttock contusions. He was thought to have a R hip
fracture clinically, however this was not seen on CT or XR. He
had SBP in 70's, so was given 3L NS, and SBP improved to 100's.
He had O2sat in 80's on RA, which increased to 90's on 100% NRB.
He received naloxone, vitamin K 10mg PO, Vanc 1g IV, CTX 1g IV,
Dexamethasone 10mg IV, 2 U FFP, and 1 U PRBC's. A right IJ was
placed, and he was transferred to the MICU for further care.

.
R femur/hip XR: No evidence of fracture or dislocation.
Degenerative changes of the hips.
.
CXR: There has been interval placement of right internal jugular
approach central venous catheter, with catheter tip projecting
over the distal SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac and
mediastinal contours are unchanged. The right costophrenic angle
is excluded on current radiograph. No focal areas of
consolidation are seen. Note is made of sternotomy wires.
.
CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: Large contusions of the buttocks, right
greater than left as well as smaller contusion of the left flank
and lateral left chest. No other evidence of traumatic injury
including no fracture. No change in slightly enlarged
mediastinal lymph nodes. Small right renal cyst as well as small
subcentimeter hypodense lesion of the right kidney, too small to
definitively characterize. 17-mm hyperdense round lesion of the
right kidney measures higher density than expected for simple
cyst, but is unchanged compared to [**3179-10-30**] and may represent
proteinaceous material within a cyst. Extensive [**Year (4 digits) 1092**]
calcifications suggest history of diabetes.
.
CT head: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or
fracture.
.
CT C-spine: No fracture. Mild degenerative changes of the
cervical spine.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**3181-4-12**]
FINDINGS: No intracranial hemorrhage, mass, shift of normally
midline structures, hydrocephalus or infarction are identified.
No underlying fractures are identified. Paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air cells are well aerated.
IMPRESSION: No masses or infarction identified. No fracture.
.
EEG [**3181-4-14**]:
This 24 hour video EEG telemetry captured occasional generalized
spike and slow wave or polyspike and slow wave discharges in
drowsiness and sleep. This finding suggest an underlying primary
generalized epilepsy. No electrographic seizures or pushbutton
activations were captured. The slow and disorganized background
with bursts of generalized theta or delta frequency slowing
suggest an encephalopathy. Infection, medications, and metabolic
disturbances are among the most common causes.
.
BILAT UP EXT VEINS US  [**3181-4-19**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of upper extremity deep venous
thrombosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
58 YO M with h/o PE (on coumadin), CAD s/p CABG, s/p L BKA, who
presents s/p fall with elevated INR, anemia, hypotension, and
hypoxia.
.
1) Hypotension: Likely [**2-27**] to dehydration from decreased PO
intake and in the setting of blood loss. Resolved with 3u PRBC
and fluids. CTA was negative for PE. CT
chest/abdomen/pelvis/head negative for significant bleeding.
His blood pressure had then remained stable while in the MICU
and he was transferred to the medical floor.  He had an episode
of hypotension on HD 6 also with sinus tachycardia.  EKG was
stable and he re ruled out for MI by cardiac enzymes.  This was
thought to be due to poor po intake and his BP and HR responded
to IVFs.  With improvement in po intake, his blood pressure
remained stable and his BB were restarted (BB for history of
CAD).
.
2) Hypoxia: Pt reports being on home O2 (appears to have been on
4L home O2 per last discharge in [**12-31**]). O2 requirement in past
likely due to PE. CTA neg for new PE on this admission. Pt may
also have been hypoxic [**2-27**] symptomatic anemia in setting of COPD
(per CT read). Pt appeared to be at baseline on admission.  He
may need outpatient PFTs.
.
3) Elevated INR: Pt has blood drawn by VNA, followed by
"[**Hospital1 872**] Labs." He reports normal INR the week before
admission. Ddx includes malnutrition in setting of elevated
dilantin level. He was initially given Vit K and FFP to reverse
INR. Home coumadin restarted [**4-9**] when INR < 3.0.  He also
received heparin IV bridge.  His INR was subtherapeutic after
several days of coumadin and his dose was increased.  At the end
of his hospital admission, the only issue keeping him in the
hospital was heparin IV dependence while await INR to return to
therapeutic range.  He was discharged on enoxaparin, to be taken
until his INR returned to therapeutic levels.  His INR will be
checked by his VNA.
.
4) Seizure disorder: The patient has been taking dilantin for
decades.  He was started on coumadin in [**12-31**] after a PE.
Dilantin and coumadin often can interact and it was thought that
this interaction may have led to the supratherapeutic level of
dilantin.  His dilantin was held and his level was followed.  At
one point during the hospital course, there was a question as to
whether the patient had a seizure.  Neurology was involved and
recommended and EEG.  The EEG did show some abnormalities
although not seizure activity.  Neurology recommended
discontinuing dilantin given drug interactions with coumadin and
starting keppra.  Keppra was started and dilantin was
dicontinued.  The change in medications was explained to the
patient at the time of the change and at the time of discharge.
He will have outpatient follow up with neurology.
.
5) Anemia: likely [**2-27**] diffuse ecchymoses in setting of
supratherapeutic INR. Pt was guaiac negative, so GIB unlikely.
Iron studies, B12, folate all WNL.
.
6) Frequent falls: pt with frequent falls at home (lives alone),
likely mechanical in setting of worsening RLE ischemic
neuropathy. Pt may have been pre-syncopal due to dehydration.
He was evaluated by PT/OT and social work.  PT had initially
recommended rehab placement but the patient refused despite our
efforts to convince to go to rehab.  After several more days
working with physical therapy, PT felt the patient was safe to
go home with home physical therapy services.
.
7) CAD: The patient has a history of CAD.  EKG without ischemic
changes and he ruled out for MI by cardiac enzymes.  Initially
ASA and plavix were held given elevated INR and transfusion
requirement but were restarted once INR therapeutic.  BB was
also initially held as the patient was hypotensive but was
restarted and titrated up to home dose once stable.
.
8) Communication: with patient.  The patient's medication
changes were gone over with him in great detail.  The patient
was taught to use enoxaparin subcutaneous injections by the
nursing staff.  The keppra dose which was being titrated up was
discussed with the patient and over the phone with VNA services.
