TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Cath clean (minimal CAD), concern for anomolous pulmonary venous
   return as SVC O2 saturation was 93%. Recommendation for cardiac MRI;
   but patient is intubated, so cannot be done. Will do a TTE today with a
   bubble study to rule out other left to right shunts. From that test,
   Cards (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **]) will assess whether a TEE is a worthwhile
   test. Ideal to do cardiac MRI once patient is extubated...but not very
   responsive right now, so unsure as to when that will be.
   - EP consult pending to assess etiology/reason for sudden VT
   - Had lots of PVC's around [**3008**], checked lytes...K of 4, gave 20 of K
   - Spike to 101, Tachycardic with questionable started empiric tx with
   vanc and levofloxacin o/n Bcx/sputum cx sent

   CT Head/Neck:
   Diffuse sulcal and ventricular effacement with loss of [**Doctor Last Name 969**]-white
   matter differentiation, consistent with diffuse cerebral edema
   secondary to anoxic injury. There is no hemorrhage, no midline shift
   and the basilar cisterns are preserved. There is pan-sinus mucosal
   disease. No fracture is identified.
   No fracture or malalignment in the cervical spine. mild spondylosis
   with mild canal stenosis. small lucent lesions noted in the C5
   vertebral body of uncertain etiology.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known patient firstname **] [**Known patient lastname 7178**] is a 64 YO M wtih history of MVP and bicuspid aortic
   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - Unclear etiology, but patient was having
   wide-complex tachycardia at 220 BPM. The preciptiant of the cardiac
   arrest is still unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia (VFib
   specificallY) or seizure. Stroke with AFib is another posibility, but
   we cannot assess any deficits a this time given sedation.  Also
   possible it could be ischemia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Serial ECGs
   - Trend CE
   - Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1760**]: cardiac cath today to r/o CAD
   - Neurology consult today re: ?seizure and mental status off sedation
   -> cortical function given minimally responsive state
   .
   #. CAD - Patient with normal stress test 2 weeks prior, multiple ECG
   changes (right and left bunndle as above), Trop I of 2.24 and CK of
   ~5500 with negative MBI. He does not have any risk factors, was not on
   aspirin and did not have chest pain. This makes unlikley that he has
   CAD as presenting symptom.
   - Cardiac cath today
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Trend CE
   - Serial ECGs
   - Continue Metorpolol (increased to 50mg po/ng TID)
   - On simvastatin 20mg po daily
   - No indications for ACEI/[**Last Name (un) 281**] given not known CAD and most-likley
   increased CE after CPR
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   - Plavix load given
   - Plavix 75 mg daily
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt currently with LBBB morphology, but RBBB in multiple
   ECGs at other hospital. Pt also has extensive ectopy. At this time his
   electrolytes are normal. No signs of ischemia. Dilated heart in
   echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF, bicuspid AS and mixomatous
   degeneration of mitral valve. [**Month (only) 11**] be going in and out of Atrial
   Fibrilation.
   - Repelte electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 50 mg TID for now
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   - EP consult in AM
   - Discuss anticoagulation for AFib, poor candidate given EtOH. Will
   hold until CT scan negative.
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #. Fever - Pt was found down and s/p cooling protocol. WBC was high up
   to 14,000. No signs of infection on CXR and UA clean at OSH. Concern
   for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. Given no infiltrates
   will hold on antibiotics for now. Withdrawal is another consideration.
   Febrile to 100.6 last night.
   - FU U/A
   - FU CXR
   - FU Blood cultures
   - No antibiotics for now
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse - Pt with last drink 4 days ago. Has been getting
   ativan and valium. No signs of withdrawal at this time (HR, BP
   adequte), but difficult to assess given beta-blocker and sedated.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; will hold for now pending neuro
   consult
   .
   #. [**Name (NI) 7181**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis in the
   settinf of code and being found down.
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above
   .
   #. Hematuria - Resolved. Most likely traumatic after Foley placement.

   CT Head/Neck:
   Diffuse sulcal and ventricular effacement with loss of [**Doctor Last Name 969**]-white
   matter differentiation, consistent with diffuse cerebral edema
   secondary to anoxic injury. There is no hemorrhage, no midline shift
   and the basilar cisterns are preserved. There is pan-sinus mucosal
   disease. No fracture is identified.
   No fracture or malalignment in the cervical spine. mild spondylosis
   with mild canal stenosis. small lucent lesions noted in the C5
   vertebral body of uncertain etiology.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known patient firstname **] [**Known patient lastname 7178**] is a 64 YO M wtih history of MVP and bicuspid aortic
   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - Unclear etiology, but patient was having
   wide-complex tachycardia at 220 BPM. The preciptiant of the cardiac
   arrest is still unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia (VFib
   specificallY) or seizure. Stroke with AFib is another posibility, but
   we cannot assess any deficits a this time given sedation.  Also
   possible it could be ischemia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Serial ECGs
   - Trend CE
   - Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1760**]: cardiac cath today to r/o CAD
   - Neurology consult today re: ?seizure and mental status off sedation
   -> cortical function given minimally responsive state
   .
   #. CAD - Patient with normal stress test 2 weeks prior, multiple ECG
   changes (right and left bunndle as above), Trop I of 2.24 and CK of
   ~5500 with negative MBI. He does not have any risk factors, was not on
   aspirin and did not have chest pain. This makes unlikley that he has
   CAD as presenting symptom.
   - Cardiac cath today
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Trend CE
   - Serial ECGs
   - Continue Metorpolol (increased to 50mg po/ng TID)
   - On simvastatin 20mg po daily
   - No indications for ACEI/[**Last Name (un) 281**] given not known CAD and most-likley
   increased CE after CPR
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   - Plavix load given
   - Plavix 75 mg daily
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt currently with LBBB morphology, but RBBB in multiple
   ECGs at other hospital. Pt also has extensive ectopy. At this time his
   electrolytes are normal. No signs of ischemia. Dilated heart in
   echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF, bicuspid AS and mixomatous
   degeneration of mitral valve. [**Month (only) 11**] be going in and out of Atrial
   Fibrilation.
   - Repelte electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 50 mg TID for now
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   - EP consult in AM
   - Discuss anticoagulation for AFib, poor candidate given EtOH. Will
   hold until CT scan negative.
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #. Fever - Pt was found down and s/p cooling protocol. WBC was high up
   to 14,000. No signs of infection on CXR and UA clean at OSH. Concern
   for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. Given no infiltrates
   will hold on antibiotics for now. Withdrawal is another consideration.
   Febrile to 100.6 last night.
   - FU U/A
   - FU CXR
   - FU Blood cultures
   - No antibiotics for now
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse - Pt with last drink 4 days ago. Has been getting
   ativan and valium. No signs of withdrawal at this time (HR, BP
   adequte), but difficult to assess given beta-blocker and sedated.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; will hold for now pending neuro
   consult
   .
   #. [**Name (NI) 7181**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis in the
   settinf of code and being found down.
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above
   .
   #. Hematuria - Resolved. Most likely traumatic after Foley placement.
