History of Present Illness:
65 y.o male with pmhx of DM type 2, COPD on 2L home O2, and CKD
(recently started on HD in [**3-/2565**]), who presents with fevers,
hypotension.The patient was at dialysis, and reported fever up
to 100.0 with chills.Approx. 75 % of the dialysis was completed
per ems and he recieved total of 1.5g of vanco at the dialysis
center. The patient does make a small amount of urine at
baseline and denies dysuria. He endorses a nonproductive cough
for a couple days, but denies chest pain, nausea,
vomiting,abdominal pain, confusion, headaches, sick contacts or
recent travel.
.
Of note in [**3-/2565**] the patient started dialysis which was
complicated by MRSA bactremia, and hypotension. He was admitted
and had his dialysis line removed, TTE at the time negative for
endocarditis, he was discharged with new HD line and 6 weeks of
Vancomycin. He has been followed by outpatient [**Hospital **] clinic for
this and completed therapy in 6/[**2564**].
.
In the ED initial vitals were: 101.4 75 130/44 16 100% 2L Nasal
Cannula and the patient recieved 500mg Meropenem and 500mg p.o
tylenol. He became tachypnic to 40s and O2 sats down to low 90s
on 4L NC after 1 liter of NS and so put on bipap and went to
100% oxygen sat. He was weaned off of bipap after less than 1
hour and now resp status stable on 4L NC once again. He was
given 0.5 mg IV ativan for comfort.For hypotension with SBP
70's, a right IJ central catheter was placed and low dose
Levophed started with SBP's in the 90's.The patient was
transferred for further care to the ICU.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient is off BIPAP and breathing
well. He is mentating well and the above HPI was obtained. He
says his breathing is "better." The below review of systems was
obtained including no chest pain, nausea, productive cough. He
has felt "crummy for few days" but will not elaborate.

Review of systems:

Brief Hospital Course:
65 year old male with Type 2 DM, lung disease on 2L home O2, and
ESRD (recently started on HD in [**2565-4-9**]) who presents with
fever and chills at dialysis complicated by hypotension.

# HD line associated GPC Septicemia.  He was admitted to the
MICU with norepinephrine gtt requirement which was weaned off
within 24 hours on [**2565-7-6**].  He was empirically covered with
Vancomycin and Meropenem which was narrowed to Vancomycin once
blood cultures grew GPC. HD line was removed on [**2565-7-6**].
Right IJ line which was placed on [**2565-7-6**] was also removed on
[**2565-7-7**]. He underwent placement of a new right-sided tunneled
IJ HD catheter on [**2565-7-9**]. He underwent TTE for evaluation of
the presence of endocarditis, which was non-diagnostic.
Subsequently, he underwent TEE, which did not show any evidence
of vavular vegitations or abscesses. Blood cultures speciated to
MRSA, and he was treated with vancomycin for a total course of 4
weeks (through [**2565-8-1**]). As an outpatient, this will be dosed
via HD protocol, and will be managed by his nephrologist. While
on antibiotics, should have weekly CBC, LFT's, and blood
chemistries for the next 3 weeks, or until instructed to stop by
PCP or Renal Doctors.

# HTN/dCHF/right heart failure (EF>55%): Held metoprolol while
hypotensive, but continued aspirin 81 mg daily. Restarted
metoprolol at 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**2565-7-7**]. Blood pressures were well
controlled after restarting this medication.

# Rheumatoid arthritis: No active issues on this admisison.
Hydroxychroloquine was continued.

# Hx Pulmonary Embolism on Coumadin: Emailed Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 3933**]
and told her we aren't bridging coumadin and ask if she objects
for any reason - she does not know PMH and could not get
records. Pt says only had PE once many years ago. PCP OK with
discontinuing coumadin.

# ESRD: Recieved most of dialysis session prior to MICU
transfer. Electrolytes remained stable. Following the removal of
his infected HD line, he was given an HD holiday. With placement
of a new HD line, HD was reinitiated. Upon discharge he was
restarted on his normal HD schedule on M/W/F. Next session will
be [**2565-7-12**].

# COPD: Goal SaO2 is 90-92%. Continued on home Fluticasone,
Albuterol standing and Tiotropium. He was maintained on his home
oxygen requirement and BiPAP at night.

# EKG changes: Has baseline right bundle branch block, but did
have deeper ST segments in anterolateral distribution in the
setting of hypotension and tachycardia. Likely rate related
changes vs lead placement. Patient denied any current chest
pain, pressure, nausea/vomiting. EKG similar to priors upon lead
change. CE stable. No further action necessary.

# Contact Dermatitis: Noted following exposure to chloraprep
and/or betadine. These medications were added as allergies on
his record. Follow-up with allergy as an outpatient to further
explore this issue is being arranged by care connections.

# Hypophosphatemia: Resolved. Stopped sevelamer on this
admission. Phosphate management per renal as outpatient.

# Bipolar disorder/Schizoaffective disorder: No signs or
symptoms of psychosis. Continued his home divalproex,
oxcarbazepine, and risperdone and clinically trend mental
status.

# Diabetes mellitus II: Sugars were well controlled on this
admission. He was maintained on a Humalog sliding scale. He was
discharged on the same.

# Obesity hypoventilation syndrome and OSA: Maintained on BIPAP
at night.

Transitional Issues:
-Please resume HD on Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule. Next
session [**2565-7-12**].
-Needs vancomycin, dosed via HD protocol, through [**2565-8-1**].
-Please check weekly CBC, LFT's, and blood chemistries for the
next 3 weeks, or until instructed to stop by PCP or Renal
Doctors.
-Please only use hypoallergenic occlusive dressings with IV
therapy, and please avoid the use of chloraprep and betadyne.
-Needs evaluation by Allergy to determine if he is allergic to
betadine and/or  chlorhexidine.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known patient lastname **],

You were recently admitted to [**Hospital1 969**] for treatment of fevers and chills. While you were
hospitalized, you were found to have bacteria in your blood,
likely from your dialysis catheter. Your infected dialysis
catheter was removed, and you were treated with antibiotics. A
new dialysis catheter was placed, and you were restarted on
hemodialysis. During your hospitalization, you developed low
blood pressure, requiring a brief stay in the medical ICU. The
cause of this low blood pressure was likely the infection in
your blood. During your ICU stay, you were on medications to
treat your low blood pressure, and you improved. Those
medications were stopped, and you were transferred to the normal
medical floor.

When you leave the hospital, you will need to continue to have
hemodialysis, per your normal routine. You will also need to
continue to receive IV antibiotics through [**2565-8-1**]. This
will be managed by your kidney doctors.

Also, while you were hospitalized, it was observed that you
developed a rash following exposure to products used to clean
your skin, including betadine and chloraprep. Please consider
this an allergic reaction, and avoid exposure to these cleaning
agents in the future.

Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 29**] MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs.
