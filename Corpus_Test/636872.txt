TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Elevated HR (up to 150s) throughout the day.  Planned for TEE today to
   look for vegetations, evaluate atrium size, as well as for possible
   pre-cardioversion however patient refuses it at this time.  Says he
   wants to discuss it with his outpatient cardiologist
today or
   tomorrow
   - EKG shows atypical flutter.
   - Started on amiodarone bolus plus drip on [**8-20**].  Will keep on diltiazem
   and beta-blocker until he converts
   - Questionable SIRS is resolving- BP improved, benign labs.  On vanc,
   zosyn, levaquin
   -CT torso-> RLL air bronchogram suggestive of pneumonia, small right
   pleural effusion, reactive LAD in mediastinum, large calcified cystic
   mass in spleen likely old, large edematous kidneys bilaterally with
   stranding (cannot rule out pyelo because no IV contrast)
   -Loose BM sent for C diff in setting of abx
   -Patient became acutely SOB, anxious, improved with lorazepam and
   albuterol/ipratropium nebs; CXR shows stable right pleural effusion,
   given Lasix 60mg IV as well
   -INR up to 3.2 [**8-21**] AM
   -Na down to 130 on [**8-21**] AM (134 on [**8-20**])

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with single-vessel CABG in [**2929**], hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
   diabetes, PAF, presented with fatigue, fever found to be in Afib with
   RVR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: AF w/ RVR currently HD stable. Has been admitted w/ this
   before. Has been taking his prescribed metoprolol dose as well as dilt
   and warfarin. Likely AF RVR [**2-18**] dehydration/sepsis physiology and
   fever.
   - Now on home diltiazem and metoprolol doses
   - Plan for TEE today to rule out vegetations and consider cardioversion
   given pt. not consistently in AF and tolerates poorly.
   - Suppress fever w/ standing tylenol as appears to be driving AF/RVR.
   - Started on amiodarone yesterday.  Titrate down diltiazem given
   potential cardioversion and potential for sinus bradycardia.  Down to
   20mg of dilt today (30mg yesterday).
   .
   #Fever: Cough at baseline, ? lingular PNA. On vanc/zosyn for HAP
   treatment, but no overt pna on cxr.  Also, pt still febrile despite
   these abx.  Other sources for fever include RLE ulcer (less likely, as
   pt. states that this has been stable) or drug fever.
   -continue vanc and zosyn
   - CT torso-> RLL air bronchogram suggestive of pneumonia, small right
   pleural effusion, reactive LAD in mediastinum, large calcified cystic
   mass in spleen likely old, large edematous kidneys bilaterally with
   stranding (cannot rule out pyelo because no IV contrast)
   - sputum culture
   - Influenza negative
   - Blood cultures- negative
   - Repeat urin culture is pending
   -loose stool sample sent for C. diff on [**8-21**]- pending
   .
    # CORONARIES: Troponin leak likely [**2-18**] ARF as well as demand given RVR
   to 160s. Baseline trop about 0.10 and pt. denies chest pain so doubt
   [**2-18**] plaque rupture.
   - Continue metoprolol
   - Restart lisinopril when BP and Cr stable
   .
   # PUMP:  BLE edema and crackles in lung bases, though CXR does not show
   significant pulmonary edema. Likely dehydrated given ARF, poor PO
   intake and diarrhea/sepsis physiology.
   - hold bumetanide
   - echo showing preserved EF with normal valvular function
   - consider IV fluids given consistently elevated HR.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Will repeat CBC and if worsens consider tick borne
   ifxns.
   - stable today at 132 ([**Age over 90 **] yesterday)
   # Diabetes: Poorly controlled, last A1c 10.5% with 2/2 nephropathy and
   neuropathy.
   - Continue home glargine 44U QAM
   - ISS
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic in setting of poor PO intake, status
   post 4L aggressive fluid resuscitation in ED.
   -trend Na for now
   -if no improvement of Na in am, obtain urine lytes
   .
   # AOCKD: Baseline Cr~2, Patient endorsed poor PO intake and is likely
   pre-renal [**2-18**] hypovolemia in setting of recent illness. S/p 4L IVF in
   ED.
   -encourage PO intake
   -IVF as needed
   .
   # Anemia: baseline hct~27, at baseline today with signs/symptoms of
   bleeding.
   .
   # Anticoagulation
   -on coumadin 4mg daily.  INR up to 3.2 this AM (2.4 yesterday).
   -will hold coumadin today
   .
   #FEN: follow and replete lytes, PO diabetic diet
   .
   #ACCESS: PIV's
   .
   #PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SubQ heparin
   -Pain management with  tylenol
