   Assessment and Plan
   75 y/o M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse, CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection of foot resulting in long hospital course
   with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post
   tracheostomy on TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and
   klebsiella in the urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to
   explain recent fevers and hypotension.. [**10-11**] aspirated now with non
   functioning G tube and intermittent SBO/illeus which has been difficult
   to resolve although he is now tolerating a slow advance in his tube
   feeds.
   >Fever/HOTN
 sepsis +/- adrenal insufficiency and/or anaphylactoid
   reaction / drug fever. Defervesced and off pressors without any new Abx
   and with d/c of fluconazole. No other apparent source of infection. BAL
   conts to show GNR consistent with prior known pathogens. Hydrocortisone
   was started on [**10-14**] in the setting of refractory hypotension and we
   were able to wean off pressors.  He has an emerging pattern of
   increasingly resistant pathogens. We have changed coverage as below and
   awating BAL sensitivity data.  He also has a pseudomonas pathogen
   (<4000 colonies in BAL). We will need to figure out exactly how long to
   treat as he has been on meropenem since [**10-6**] and Cefepime [**10-18**]. We
   will discuss with ID a course duration.
   - Change to Cefepime and  continued meropenem.
   -Change to prednisone with a taper  to begin11/20, 10 mg starting today
   and then taper
   >Ileus vs partial SBO: We are again trying tube feed regimen, he
   tolerated 10 cc yesterday with [**Last Name (LF) 6436**], [**First Name3 (LF) 167**] cont to uptitrate 10 cc
   /shift
   -Cont reglan and advancing tube feeds
   -remove NG tube today
    > Upper GI bleed: coffee grounds in the NG tube. Will transfuse
   supportively he is at increase risk given his high dose steroids . Hct
   has remained stable
    - Hct goal < 23 or active bleeding.
   - Change PPI to PO.
   > lower [**First Name3 (LF) **] edema: increasing in the right lower [**Last Name (LF) **] , [**First Name3 (LF) 167**] r/o DVT and
   consider diuresis challenge as he is likely volume up from the resus
   efforts and the steroids.
   - LENI
   - consider diuresis
   > Hypothyroidism: likely low gut absorption given recurrent illeus we
   have changed to IV synthroid.  We will recheck free T4 later in week.
   >Renal failure /  Hyponatremia: both issues cont to slowly improve.
   Stopping the bactrim IV helped to decrease the free water load, in the
   next day or two we will need to add back free water. His renal function
   is also trending towards improvemen.
   >Resp failure
 PNA, ileus, effusions/volume overload.  His resp
   failure is complicated  by his overall profound deconditioning and will
   be difficult to improve.  We have made some improvements over the last
   24 hrs (in terms of SBO) and has tolerated PS trial ([**9-9**]) and we have
   been able to make slow efforts to decrease his PS requirement
   -Continue ventilatory support
   - Pulm toilet

 PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE (PVD) WITHOUT CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA:
   holding plavix pending resolution of possible SBO
   >PAIN:
   -Start Tylenol around the clock
   -avoid opiates
   - continue wound care, f/u vascular surgery as outpt
    Other issues per ICU resident note.
