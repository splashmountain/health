   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -Renal spoke to outpatient renal doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5148**] med list (per
   patient's mom, she had been taken off clonidine, per doc, she is on.
   We have kept her on clonidine).
   -Off labetalol gtt since yesterday afternoon
   -Outpatient PD settings (2.5%, 4.25%, 2.5%, 4.25%, 2.5% alternating
   doses, ideally 1 hr each but getting 4 hr each here).  I/Os for
   yesterday are inaccurate.  Per metavision, her balance is approx neg
   400 but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN she is neg > 2L.
   -Significant headaches overnight.  Minimal response to 1 mg IV
   dilaudid.  Gave ASA/Percocet (approx outpt. Excedrin/Perc).

   Imaging (all from [**7-26**]): TTE->effusion decreased
   TTE:
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
   estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric
   left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left
   ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
   normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review) of
   [**3332-1-1**], mild aortic regurgitation and mild mitral regurgitation are
   now seen. Left ventricular systolic function is less vigorous (now low
   normal) suggesting a diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc.). The
   pericardial effusion has largely resolved.
   CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
   Based on [**3332**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo
   findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical decisions
   regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and
   echocardiographic data.
   Head CT:
   no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, or mass
   CXR:
   In comparison with study of [**6-16**], there is again substantial
   enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, accentuated by the low lung
   volumes.
   Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels may reflect some
   overhydration. No
   evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
   Assessment and Plan
   Pericardial effusion, negative [**Doctor First Name 1168**]
   HA:  Assess if ASA/Perc helped.  Neuro has seen for HA as outpatient.
   Recs: depacote, SSRI, Excedrin, Tylenol PM.  Pain vs. neuro c/s for
   further management.
   21 yo F with history of ESRD on PD s/p failed renal tx after recurrence
   of MPGN, with recurrent admissions for hypertensive urgency, here with
   hypertensive urgency.
   # Hypertensive urgency
 [**7-27**] BPs stable in 150s/90s
   - Turned off labetalol gtt on [**7-26**] (afternoon).  Also, restarted all
   home po meds as well as clonidine patch (does not wear at home).
   - Started metoprolol po on [**7-27**] per home dosing.
   - Continue PD as removing volume is beneficial for pressures
   - Head CT was neg for bleed
   - Believe she is on the correct home regimen (renal checked)
   # ESRD on PD: Now on a regimen that more closely approximates home PD,
   2.5%, 4.25%, 2.5%, 4.25%, 2.5% alternating doses, ideally 1 hr each but
   getting 4 hr each here
   - Nephrology following who checked meds and PD with outpt nephrologist
   - continue renagel and nephrocap when taking Pos
   - Renal rec aluminum hydroxide 30 with meals TID for increased phos
   (does not cause nausea)
   # Nausea/vomiting: Unclear precipitant, though appears consistent with
   prior episodes.  Much improved the morning of [**7-27**].
   - symptom control with compazine and zofran prn
   - Still having some difficulty with po [**12-19**] decreased appetite
   - Ruled out peritonitis or cardiac ischemia as cause
   # Headache: Mostly resolved
   - ASA/percocet more helpful than Dilaudid
   # Eosinophilia: apprears chronic.  Continue to follow
   # FEN: low salt renal diet when able, no IVF, continue to monitor lytes
   & replete if necessary (potassium per PD).
   #ACCESS: PIVs, PD cath
   #PPx
   - Heparin SC for DVT prophylaxis
   - no need for PPI currently
   - bowel meds prn
