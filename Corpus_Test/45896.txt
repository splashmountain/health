History of Present Illness:
84 year old male veteran of WWII with a complicated history
including CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, bladder CA, and ANCA+
vasculitis who initially presented to OSH for abdomainl pain 12
days ago. He developed acute onset of nausea and dry heaves and

dysfunctions and suspected stenoses ; the last Fistulogram, 7-mm
balloon angioplasty of intragraft stenoses was done on [**3381-3-1**].

Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.

kidney, but possibly with a component of atheroembolic disease
in light of persistently elevated eosinophil count and mildly
low complement levels.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the West 1 service under Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 589**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1086**] with
ESRD and
near-obstructing cecal lesion.  Initially plan was to obtain a
colonoscopy, but he was unable to tolerate the prep and exam was
poor quality. CEA was elevated.  CXR was without lesions,
non-contrast CT did not demonstrated evidence of metastatic
disease.  A PICC was placed and TPN started while he was kept
NPO. On [**3381-7-14**], he was taken to the OR by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 589**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1086**] who
performed exploratory laparotomy with right colectomy for a
contained cecel perforation. Postop course was complicated by
need for intubated SICU stay for hypotension requiring pressor
support. Gradually, BP improved and he was able to tolerated
CVVHD as well as extubation. Subsequently, he was switched to
hemodialysis 3 time per week. He still experienced hypotension
at times. Anti-hypertensives were held. Diet was not started for
many days due to distension and lack of flatus. TPN via a picc
line was inserted. Gradually diet was reintroduced. He
experienced diarrhea requiring a flexiceal. Stool was sent
several times and was negative each time. The abdominal incision
became erythematous with drainage requiring opening. A wound vac
was applied. The wound grew citrobacter freundii and yeast.
Flagyl and Cefazolin were started on [**4-14**] and continued through
[**4-17**].  He remained afebrile.

He was transferred out of the SICU after several days only to
return to the SICU for mental status changes and respiratory
distress for aspiration. He was reintubated. He was started on
iv flagyl and vancomycin on [**4-22**]. Sputum [**4-22**] isolated
citrobacter freundii and yeast. Ceftazidime was added on [**4-26**].
This was switched to meropenum on [**4-27**]. On [**4-23**], a min bronch
with lavage yielded a sputum spec that isolated the following:

ORGANISMS/ML..
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
      ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE.    10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..

He was also noted to be VRE positive on rectal swab on [**4-23**]. IV
flagyl and Meropenum continued through [**5-3**] when these were
discontinued. He remained afebrile.

He received aggressive respiratory care with improvement. He was
transferred out of the SICU to the med-[**Doctor First Name 103**] unit where PT worked
with him. He was very weak and required max assist. He appeared
too tired to swallow food/medicines and a swallow eval was done
with recommendations for a video swallow. This was not done as
he requested to stop care.

Hemodialysis continued, but the patient repeatedly expressed
statements that he wanted to stop dialysis and stop all care. He
tended to be hypotensive during dialysis. Last hemodialysis was
on [**5-7**].  A family meeting was held with the patient, his family
and hospital care givers. The decision was made establish
comfort care orders. Palliative Care was consulted. The
patient's family requested transfer to a hospice facility closer
to their homes. [**Location (un) 520**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] and a bed became
available on [**5-9**]. The patient expressed that he was in agreement
with transfer to [**Location (un) 520**] for hospice care. Picc line, wound
vac and flexiceal was removed.

Telephone consent was obtained on [**5-9**] at 1725 from son [**Name (NI) 4805**]
[**Name (NI) **] to initiate  MA comfort care/DNR form consent prior to
discharge as the patient was very lethargic with some delerium.
He complained of intermittent abdominal pain with radiation to
back. Morphine SL was given for abdominal pain. Sublingual pain
medication were written prior to discharge.
