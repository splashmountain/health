Chief Complaint: respiratory failure
   24 Hour Events:
 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**3264-2-28**] 08:21 AM: Vigorous biventircular
   systolic function. No clinically-significant valvular disease seen.
   Normal estimated intracardiac filling pressures.
   - SBT performed for about 15-20 minutes w/ an increase in HR and RR w/
   an erratic breathing pattern. Placed back on the AC mode/ re-sedated
   and will repeat SBT in the AM.
   - Attempted PSV but pt had apneic periods and placed back on AC.

   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Acute decompensation of chronic
   hypercarbic resp failure, now s/p intubation. Probable progression of
   GVHD, however need to rule out infectious etiology. His acute
   decompensation can be secondary to mucus plug, infection/sepsis,
   bronchospasm.  CTA w/o evidence of PE and head CT w/o evidence of
   primary central process to explain acute decompensation. CXR w/o
   evidence of flash pulm edema.  Bronchoscopy notable for plugs, sputum
   sent for cultures. Probably being overventilated as PC02 of 40, whereas
   baseline in 60s.
   - Reduce respiratory rate and/or tidal volume
