   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o man with
          Shock
   o         Likely a mixed picture.  Appears somewhat hypovolemic, but
   likely septic.  Cardiac disease (particularly pericardial) is not
   excluded.
   o         Sources include C diff and pneumonia.  Decub less likely.
   Doubt atypical pneumonia given that he was on levoflox until a couple
   of days ago and that Legionella Ag is negative.  Antibiotic therapy:
          Oral vanco
          IV Flagyl
          Zosyn
   o         Discuss with cardiology (no RV pressure recorded)
   o         Goal-directed therapy, aiming for CVP a bit higher then 12
   o         Adrenal insufficiency adequately excluded
   o         Does not meet criteria for drotrecogin
   o         Other issues as per ICU team note
          C diff
   o         Vanco oral; Flagyl IV
   o         Re-attempt NG decompression
   o         Consult GI for assistance with complicated C diff management
   (?supplementary therapies)
          Repeat lactate
 if elevated consult surgery.
          ST elevations
   o         Do not appear ischemic.  Will discuss further with
   cardiology.
   Contact PCP for old records.
   Other issues as per ICU team note:
          Parkinson
          Decub
          Line site bleeding
