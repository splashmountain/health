TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:  dyspnea, nausea
   HPI:
   67 y/o M with vague medical hx presents to the ED w/ complaint of
   dyspnea and nausea with vomiting over last 3-4 days.  Pt is from former
   Soviet Republic of [**State 847**], and arrived to US 1 month ago. Pt only
   speaks Georgian and is accompanied by son-in-law who is bilingual and
   provides medical hx. Pt had been experiencing increasing fatigue over
   recent months and was encouraged to join family in US for support.
   Since arrival 1 month ago, Pt has not sought out medical care. Since
   arriving Pt has been noted to be fatigued, and alert and oriented but
   seemingly "slow" mentally. Pt has been dyspneic at times, but worse
   over past week, and over past 3-4 days Pt had nausea, vomiting. Taken
   to private doctor by family, who drew labs and recommended that he go
   to ED after finding lab abnormalities. Pt denies CP, recent fevers,
   chills.
   .
   In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.5 P 108 BP 118/56 RR 18  O2 sat 98%
   RA. Initial labs found the Pt to be hyperkalemic to 6.0, w/ a
   creatinine of 15.4, and anemic to Hct 19.8. Pt was given ASA, calcium,
   dextrose, insulin, vancomycin, zosyn, thiamine and transferred to the
   CCU.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 67 yo M w/ vague past medical hx who
   presented to the ED and was found to have acute kidney injury,
   hyperkalemia, and anemia, of unclear etiology.
   #acute kidney injury: Given hx of chronic fatigue over last few months,
   anemia, and Pt's relative stability in context of highly elevated
   BUN/Creatinine, suspect that Pt'[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] likely represents acute worsening
   of chronic renal insufficiency, rather than a completely new acute
   event. Acute causes of creatinine elevation to this degree would
   include sepsis, hypovolemic shock, renal infarct, TTP-HUS, none of
   which appear consistent w/ the Pt's presentation.  If Pt has chronic
   renal insufficiency, possible etiologies could be obstruction, likely
   from benign prostatic hypertrophy, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
   renal artery stenosis. Other potential causes for Pt's acute kidney
   injury which will be evaluated include multiple myeloma, goodpasture's
   syndrome.
   - Renal u/s to eval for hydronephrosis w/ doppler studies to eval for
   renal artery stenosis
   - Urine lytes, UPEP
   - Serum [**Doctor First Name **], anti-GBM, ASO, CK, complement, Hgb A1C
   - Will d/c Vancomycin and Zosyn as no evidence of acute infectious
   process
   - Renal consult
   - Pt to IR for placement of temporary dialysis line and plan for
   dialysis for Saturday. Will make NPO after midnight.
   .
   #Hyperkalemia
   - Will recheck K on floor
   - Kayexelate PRN
   - Plan for HD on Saturday
   - Serial EKGs
   .
   # Anemia: Most likely chronic and related to suspected chronic renal
   failure, especially considering Pt's hx of medication to increase blood
   counts. However, given Pt's age, tobacco hx, and lack of access to
   routine medical care, other causes of anemia must be ruled out,
   particularly malignancy
   - SPEP, guiac all stools, iron studies, check smear, retic count,
   hemolysis labs
   - Pt will need age appropriate cancer screening as outpatient, or as
   inpatient if medically unstable
   .
   #Hypocalcemia: Likely related to acute renal failure
   - Will replete calcium PRN
   .
   # Abdominal distention: Pt's abdomen notably distended although
   non-tender
   - F/u LFTs
   - Can consider CT scan of abdomen as inpt if clinically warranted
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet, NPO after midnite
