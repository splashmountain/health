   Assessment and Plan
    Hypotension
   -sepsis vs. cardiogenic vs. med related vs. baseline (lactate nl)
   -IVF boluses carefully given h/o CHF Hasn't required pressors
   -empiric coverage with abx.  Broaden if worsening of hemodyn status
   -elevated wbc/bandemia has been present since prior admission
   Heart failure
   - Cycle enzymes.
   - Hold ACEI, lyte
   - cont b- block given arrhythmia.
   Ventricular tachycardia
   -hemodyn stable (relative to current pressures) during event
   -cards consulted following
   -amio
   - Replete lytes
   -not seeing clear overdrive/AICD activity - lead fracture per report.
   d/w cards
   Hypoxia
   -improved since admission - currently on NC
   -wean supp O2 as tol
   Leukocytosis
   -at baseline from prior admission.  no normal wbc since [**12/2555**]
   -infection possible but no clear source, nontoxic
   -pan cx, empiric abx for now.  if cx negative would dc abx
   -? myelodysplasia
   PVD with recent revascularization.
   - Vascular following.
   - Cont vanco given concern of ?cellulitis surrounding proximal ulcer.
   Sacral decubitus.
   - Wound care consult
   .
   CKD
   -at baseline
   Remainder of plan per resident note.
