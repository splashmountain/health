.
CT c-spine: There is anterior cervical spine fusion seen at
C4-C5. Degenerative changes are seen at this level and at C3-4
and C4-5, as well as moderate to severe spinal stenosis. No
fractures are identified. There is mild kyphosis at C3-4
probably related to degenerative changes and fusion. The patient
is intubated and has a nasogastric tube; prevertebral soft
tissue swelling cannot be assessed. There appears to be some
posterior pleural thickening at the right pulmonary apex.
IMPRESSION: Degenerative changes of the spine, spinal stenosis,
with cervical spine fusion at C4-5; no acute fracture is
identified.
.
CT head: No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Previous left
craniotomy and encephalomalacia of left frontal lobe.
.
CXR: 1. Successful intubation. Successful placement of
nasogastric tube.
2. Retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms suggesting
consolidation.
.
EKG: Sinus rhythm
Inferior/lateral ST-T changes
Since previous tracing, no significant change
.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the medical ICU, intubated and
sedated. He was extubated on hospital day #1 without
complication, and quickly weaned to room air by HD [**2-10**]. He
remained somewhat sleepy but arousable to voice. A psychiatry
consult was obtained and the patient was deemed not suicidal and
the exact etiology of his obtundation/respiratory depression
remained unclear.
.
Unresponsive episode:
The pt was found down after being given Seroquel at an outside
detoxification facility. The pt was noted to be unresponsive and
was intubated for respiratory depression. The pt also underwent
a CT head which ruled out a mass effect or bleed. The pt also
underwent an MRI neck which showed the pt to be status post
fusion at C4-5. There was no evidence of a fracture involving
the posterior aspects of the vertebral bodies or acute
encroachment on the spinal canal. There was hyperintensity in
the cervical spinal cord at C4-5 which likely represents malacia
from prior compression. There was some evidence of a narrowing
of the spinal canal at the C4-5 and [**5-13**] levels but the spinal
cord was also noted to be atrophic through these levels and did
not appear compressed. There was no evidence of ligamentous
injury posteriorly (of note, the hardware prevented evaluation
of the possibility of anterior longitudinal ligament
disruption). To date, the etiology of the pt's unresponsive
episode was unclear but it was thought to be most likely toxic/
metabolic. The pt was evaluated by psychiatry and they
recommended a toxic-metabolic workup. On the first day on the
[**Hospital1 **], the pt requested to leave against medical advise. The pt
was evaluated urgently by the psychiatry service and was deemed
to be capable of making a decision. Pt was deemed safe for
discharge, and appeared to have good understanding the of
medical concerns and risks of premature discharge. The
psychiatry service felt that the pt was not suicidal, psychotic
or confused. Their primary concern was that pt will resume
alcohol abuse on discharge. He was also subsequently evaluated
by the Medicine Attending, Dr. [**Name (NI) **] and was deemed
medically stable for discharge home. The following studies:
TSH, RPR and B12 were pending at the time of discharge and will
need to be followed up as an outpatient by the patient's primary
care provider.
.
ETOH abuse
The pt was noted to be slightly tremulous on admission to the
[**Hospital1 **]. It is likely that he is out of the window period for
alcohol withdrawal. The pt was continued on  thiamine, folate
and multivitamins. The pt was encouraged to participate in a
more intensive addictions treatment, including inpatient
rehabilitation. The pt reported that he is on a "waiting list"
at [**Hospital 1327**] Hosp and does not want us to pursue this further.
.
Seizure disorder
The pt was continued on anti-epileptics and there was evidence
of active seizure activity.The pt was offered complete workup of
possible underlying seizures, including an EEG, but he refused.
The pt was made aware of the possibility of recurrent seizures
with the possibility of harm to himself or someone else. The pt
acknowledged and accepted these risks. He was instructed to not
drive until he was cleared to do so by a neurologist. The pt may
benefit from an EEG as an outpatient in the event of recurrent
seizures.
.
Neck pain
The pt was noted to complain of neck pain. There was no evidence
of fracture or misalignment on CT. The pt also underwent an MRI
that showed no evidence of a cord compression or a ligamentous
injury. He was given a soft collar by the orthopedics service
which he agreed to wear until there was improvement of neck
pain.
.
?Ascites
The pt was noted to have a mild shifting dullness on clinical
exam. However, there is no current evidence of synthetic
dysfunction. The pt would benefit from an out-patient evaluation
of underlying ascites and possible cirrhosis with an abdominal
ultrasound.
.
Prophylaxis:
The pt was maintained on pantoprazole and was encouraged to
ambulate.
