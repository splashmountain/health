   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p resection, prostate
   ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured
   appendix on medical therapy who was admitted with hypernatremia and
   atrial fibrillation and is now intubated for respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of IVF, afib with RVR, and
   profound metabolic acidosis that the patient was attempting to
   compensate for (initial pH on floor 7.16).   Patient was overbreathing
   the ventilator overnight when less sedated to increase pH and
   simultaneously driving down CO2.  Minute ventilation 12-17L/min.
   Patient has a history of COPD and likely chronically has a high CO2.
   Will not try to achieve his baseline CO2 currently as there is still an
   ongoing metabolic acidosis.
   - Continue to titrate vent settings to achieve target minute
   ventilation around 12-13 L/min
   - Will attempt to wean as acidosis improves
   - VAP precautions
   - Repeat CXR in am
   .
   # Fever: Patient has been on cipro/flagyl for medical management of a
   ruptured appendicitis.  Fever may represent worsening of this process
   vs. aspiration pneumonitis from intubation vs. some other occult
   infectious process.  Notably, the patient does not have an elevated WBC
   count.
   - Cont. cipro & flagyl
   - CT abdomen to examine for interval changes, worsening appendicitis
   vs. duodenal-pancreatic communication given low HCO3
   - f/u blood, urine, & sputum cultures
   - trend fever curve & WBC count.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Patient was noted to have tachycardia (afib vs ST vs
   MAT) during last admission which was treated with IV lopressor
   transitioned to PO lopressor.  A CTA at that time was negative for PE
   and CE ruled out MI.  Cardiology at that time felt that the rhythm was
   likely sinus tachy with APBs/MAT, and recommended watching as well as
   possibly initiating digoxin which was not started at that time.
   Patient has ruled out for an MI again.  Dilt drip stable at 10 mg/hr
   overnight with heart rates in the low 100s and SBP in the low 100s.
   Unable to transition to PO meds at this time as patient is NPO due to
   ruptured appendix.
   - Continue dilt gtt, titrate down as tolerated and transition to home
   metoprolol when able to take POs
   - Can discuss possible initiation of digoxin once ARF improves
   .
   # Non-AG metabolic acidosis: Differential includes saline
   resuscitation, diarrhea, renal failure (decreased acid excretion),
   increased amino acids in TPN, or RTA.  Urine lytes with anion gap.
   - Switch to NaHCO3 for fluid resuscitation given hyperchloremia and
   hypernatremia
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Has been ongoing for several days at rehab.  Unclear
   if patient has received more than 1L of free water as it is not
   documented in NH paperwork.
   - Calculated free water deficit is 2.8L
   - Patient received 0.5 L D51/2NS then 1.5L D5W overnight.
   - transition to D5W + 3amps NaHCO3 for IVF
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient appears dry on exam.  Likely
   pre-renal though may have a component of RTA or ATN as above.  FENa
   1.26%, so likely not entirely pre-renal.
   - IVF resuscitation
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renally dose all meds
   - nephrology consult
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline appears to be around 37.  Slightly decreased from
   prior.  [**Month (only) 11**] be partially dilutional.  He was noted to be anemic with
   guaiac positive stools during last admission.  B12,  folate, & iron
   within normal limits (though ferritin may be elevated as an acute phase
   reactant and should be rechecked).  [**Month (only) 11**] be partially related to CKD.
   - Continue to trend
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac all stools
   .
   # Right subclavian vein thrombosis: Significant erythema and edema of
   RUE.  Has been on lovenox since admission to rehab, now started
   coumadin for bridge on [**1-30**]. INR subtherapeutic at rehab as well as
   here. Goal INR [**12-20**].  Also appears to have erythema and swelling of RUE
   to mid-arm.  Left arm without any DVT.  Cont. heparin gtt and hold
   coumadin as avoiding PO meds until further information from CT
   abdomen.
   - Given acute renal failure, will hold lovenox and continue heparin gtt
   started in ED
   .
   # Ruptured apendicitis, medically managed: Has been on Cipro/flagyl
   since last admission. Has been afebrile and currently has no
   leukocytosis and only a mild left shift at 77 PMNs.  He is likely due
   to complete a course of flagyl/cipro in the next several days. Rec'd
   one dose of vanc/zosyn in ED due to hypotension, lactate wnl.  Surgery
   recommended reimaging abdomen.
   - As lactate wnl and patient appears dry with BP responding to fluid
   boluses, will continue cipro/flagyl for appendicitis as no other clear
   source of infection.  BPs currently normal
   - Low threshold to increase abx regimen should patient become unstable
   .
   # Pancreatic mass: Followed as o/p and appears to have been stable on
   repeat imaging.
   - Outpatient follow up
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO for now, nutrition consult for
   TPN recs
   .
   # Prophylaxis: systemic anticoagulation with heparin gtt, lansoprazole
   (is on omeprazole as o/p as well), bowel regimen
   .
   # Access: PICC line, need to confirm placement, PIV, will place A-line
   today
   .
   # Code: Full
   .
   # Communication: Patient, need to talk with HCP regarding patient
   overall status once further info from CT available.
   .
   # Disposition: pending above
