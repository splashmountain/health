   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM admitted with cardiogenic shock
   secondary to global ischemia s/p IABP removal, course complicated by
   septic shock from MSSA empyema/line infection, ARF (now off CVVH) with
   resolving hypotension and respiratory failure.  Now much improved
   overall.
   #. Acute Systolic CHF/AS leading in part to shock: The pt has an EF of
   [**11-11**]%, Moderate AS AoVA 1.0-1.2cm2 and 3+ MR
   - Holding lasix for apnea concern for pt becoming pre-renal
 goal even
   - Pt with moderate AS and 3Vessel CAD, not currently surgical candidate
   given empyema, continue to assess, will discuss with outpatient
   cardiologist
   .
   #. Empyema:  Pt felt to have initial hemothorax secondary to rib
   fractures s/p fall, complicated by superinfection.  Chest tube output
   persistently declined,.afebrile
   - Cont Nafcillin for MSSA, plan for 3 weeks s/p CT guided drainage
   ([**Date range (1) 4476**])
   - f/u thoracic recs re empyema drain
   .-
   # Coag neg staph Culture tip + - surveillance cultures growing GPC in 1
   bottle, given additional cath tip positive, will continue vancomycin
   for 7 day course for possible line infection pending final culture data
   - will check vanc trough in am
   - follow daily cultures
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia
 Transition off of gtt, to PO 400mg PO BID
   for amio load. No further episodes of sustained VT
   - Convert to maintenance dose of amio.
   .
   # Acute Kidney Injury: ATN, Cr stable. Continuing to renally dose meds,
   follow urine output.
   .
   # Agitation and mental status: Pt agitated and acutely delirious.
   Likely multifactorial related to prolonged hospitalization and longterm
   use of BZs and opiates.
   - Continue PRN ativan.  Will try increased dose of haldol this evening.
   - Continue gabapentin
   .
   # Anemia: following HCTs - stable

   # Shock liver -  now resolved:
   .
   # DM:  Lantus + SSI.  Continue standing lantus as well.
