   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 73**]), BRADYCARDIA, VALVE
   REPLACEMENT, AORTIC BIOPROSTHETIC (AVR), ANXIETY, IMPAIRED SKIN
   INTEGRITY, CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT (CABG)
   Assessment and Plan: 78 year old female POD # 10 from AVR(23
   pericardial)/CABGx3(LIMA>LAD, SVG>Diag, SVG>OM) complicated by
   respiratory failure requiring re-intubation, atrial fibrilation,
   bradycardia and short pauses of self-limiting pauses and acute kidney
   failure.
   Neurologic: Neuro checks Q: 4 hr, Pain controlled, On low dose fenatnyl
   drip with adequate pain control. Intermittently follows commands.
   Please avoid benzos. Celexa home dose. On Seroquel for post-op
   agitation.
   Cardiovascular: Aspirin, Full anticoagulation, Statins, HD stable.
   Baseline bradycardia. Post-op AF, now SB with a few episodes of
   self-limiting pauses. Still has external pacing wires, but only V-wires
   work. Will f/u on EP recs, but pt may require a permanent pacemaker.
   Please f/u on TTE done today.
   Pulmonary: Cont ETT, (Ventilator mode: CPAP + PS), Significant heavy
   secretions. Will bronch today to clean up lungs and will send BAL
   (although Abx started already). STAPH AUREUS COAG + in sputum from 2
   days ago. On Vanco for presumed pneumonia. Will most likely require a
   tracheostomy tube as unable to wean off the vent.
   Gastrointestinal / Abdomen: Bowel regimen. No evidence of liver
   dysfunction. Liver u/s demostrated ascites but no evidence of dilated
   bile duct.
   Nutrition: Tube feeding
   Renal: Foley, Acute post-op renal failure. Oliguric/anuric with rising
   BUN and Createnin. Will most likely need hemodyalysis, but no acute
   indication for now. Discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] today this issue. We
   decided that if there are no signs of kidney recovery within the next
   two days we'll place a tunnled dialysis catheter.
   Hematology: Serial Hct, Stable anemia. Monitor for now
   Endocrine: RISS, Slightly hyperglycemic today. Please increase RISS for
   a goal BG < 150
   Infectious Disease: Check cultures, ? pneumonia with increasingly large
   amount of thick secretions. Will bronch now and send BAL (pt already on
   Vanco). Check vanco levels.
   Lines / Tubes / Drains: Foley, ETT, Pacing wires
   Wounds: Dry dressings
   Imaging: CXR today
   Fluids: KVO
   Consults: CT surgery, Nephrology, P.T.
   Billing Diagnosis: Arrhythmia, (Respiratory distress: Failure),
   (Pneumonia due to procedure), Post-op complication, Acute renal failure
