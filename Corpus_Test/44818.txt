Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 78 year old gentleman with class IV CHF with an EF
20%, AF, cardiorenal syndrome, CRI, hypothyroidism, presenting
with severe CHF decompensation refractory to standard diuretic
therapies. He was transferred to the CCU after developing
hypotension with associated mental status change after attempted
diuresis with IV lasix drip along with nesiritide. In order to
treat the hypotension, consideration must be given to his poor
heart function which, in and of itself, likely has large
contribution to the hypotensive picture.  The patient was
started on lasix drip with dopamine for inotropic support. His
hemodynamic status remained tenuous and his urine output was
only marginally satisfactory.  The following morning the patient
went into atrial fibrillation and became hypotensive.
Cardioversion was not successful.  Levophed was started for
blood pressure support, dopamine was weaned. Chemical
cardioversion and rate control was successfully achieved with
amiodarone.  The patients hemodynamic status improved.  The
following morning, however, the patient again became hypotensive
with increasing oxygen requirement and declining urinary output.
 Mental status unchanged.  Vasopressin was added for blood
pressure support.

Given these events, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 205**] called a family meeting to explain
that the prognosis, unfortunately, was extremely poor.  The
family elected to make the patient comfort measure only.
Pressors were weaned off and all medicines not realted to
comfort were discontinued.  The patient expired the afternoon of
[**3501-7-25**].  His family was at the bedside.
