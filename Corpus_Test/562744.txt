TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt. underwent cardioversion for Afib, unsuccessful.  Was thus continued
   on diltiazem gtt increased to 10mg/hr with HR now in 80-90s, SBPs >
   100.  He continued to be on amiodarone at 0.5mg/min and received 150 IV
   in AM.  Pt. spiked to 100.4F oral he was panCx in early afternoon.
   Lasix drip was continued, he received chlorothiazide 250mg x2
   throughout the day, UOP was maintained > 100cc/hr.   Spiked again
   in evening to 102F rectal and 100.6F oral on Tylenol, started on
   Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and/or possible spinal soft tissue inf or
   osteo.  CXR showed mild pulm edema w/ consolidation and smal R pl
   effusion now resolved.  His JP came out early in afternoon, per Ortho,
   NTD.  Pt. has abdominal distension and likely prolonged post op ileus.
    He received 2 water enemas w/o effect, KUB repeat showed adynamic
   ileus w/ more bowel distension that expected from ileus, but per
   radiology still its likely ileus and not SBO.  NGT was placed, and put
   out over 800cc by MN.  Enema'swere d/ced as was lactulose.   Code
   status was addressed and patient is FULL CODE.  Midnight lytes were Na
   136, K 3.7, Mg 2.1, Cr 1.5.  Pt. had two watery stools o/n.  Currently
   Amio at 0.5mg/min, Lasix 15mg/hr, Dilt 10mg/hr.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF and ileus.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2976**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD.  The patient was treated conservatively, and was not
   anticoagulated due to risk of bleeding in the post-operative period.
   The patient's troponin's peaked at 72.  He remained chest pain free
   after his intial event.  The patient was begun on heparin gtt after
   developing new AF.  He continues to be chest pain free.  No signs or
   symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath on Monday per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 155**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - change Metoprolol to Diltiazem given afib and hypotension, worsening
   pulmonary edema
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam, with distended neck veins,
   low O2 sats, and crackles on lung exam with low SBP.  O2 requirements
   increasing likely c/w worsening pulmonary edema.
   - continue Lasix gtt with Diovan to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - daily CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows
   - change Metoprolol to Dilt gtt for HR control
   - cardioversion today to improve atrial kick and HR to augment CO
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Currently in AF, and started on heparin gtt.  Given Metoprolol last
   night with HR 100s-110s.
   - continue amioderone, give second 150mg IV bolus
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt, stop Metoprolol as per above
   - continue amio gtt, electrical cardioversion today
   - can d/c transvenous pacer as pt not been bradycardic
   .
   #  Leukocytosis:  Marked leukocytosis following surgery.  Likely stress
   response.  Has developed fever in post-op/post-MI setting even w/ RTC
   tylenol.  No bandemia.  UA does not show UTI.  CXR without clear
   infiltrate.
   - hold antibiotics until pt spikes here or evidence of infection
   - f/u urine cultures
   - Tylenol PRN for fevers
   - encourage IS
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**2-7**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage
   - serial HCT
   .
   #  Constipation:  No BM in days with distended abdomen on morphine
   PCA.  Like secondary to medication effect and post-op state with
   ileus.  KUB consistent with stool in colon.
   - colace
   - senna
   - lactulose
   - soap suds enema
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Ortho to evaluate for post-op needs.
   - IV morphine PRN
   - d/c RTC tylenol to trend fever curve.
   .
   FEN:  NPO for cardioversion and ileus
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with IV morphine
   -Bowel regimen as listed above
   CODE: to be readdressed, pt and family would like to discuss
   intubation, FULL for now
