   Assessment and Plan
   38M with NHL s/p alloBMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and BO with
   severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention, presented with dyspnea
   and cough on [**3264-2-14**], now day 9 in [**Hospital Unit Name 42**] for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, extubated [**3-7**] & re-intubated [**3-13**] after aspiration event.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure
 Patient with pre-existing lung disease
   including GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and PNA causing chronic
   hypercarbic respiratory distress. On [**3-13**] required re-intubation after
   being on CPAP for 6 days.  This was thought to be secondary to
   witnessed aspiration event. Patient underwent bronchoscopy/BAL and
   cultures are growing GN rods. Last ABG revealed metabolic alkalosis
   7.49/55/38 likely contraction alkalosis due to lasix gtt started [**3-13**].
   - Continue Prednisone 20mg PO qAM, 10mg qPM for now, consider
   increasing tonight
   - Continue Antibiotics, day 4
   - Wean respiratory rate to target baseline pCO2 of 60-80
   - decrease sedation as tolerated
   - will likely require trach, plan for Monday at the moment
   # Bilateral pneumonia: Patient with worsening bilateral LL PNA
   complicated by distal to segmental bronchial obstruction due to
   secretions, edema and adenopathy or phlegmon on [**3-13**] CTA. This is
   likely worsened in the setting of likely aspiration causing respiratory
   failure (as above) on [**3-13**] vs other inflammatory process (as above).
   Currently on Vancomycin/Cefepime/Voriconazole and metronidazole (stated
   [**3-13**]) with infectious studies pending including glucan/galactomannan,
   blood cultures pending. [**3-13**] bronch revealed 3+ PMN
s but not organisms
   were seen.
   - Continue antibiotics, day 4
   - F/U pending cultures
   - F/U glucan/galactomannan
   - Blood cultures if spikes
   - IN Fluticasone/Afrin nasal spray
   - f/u BAL cultures
   # Nutrition: Completed calorie counts, now with Dobhoff in place.
   Patient (+) at least 5L LOS.
   - F/U Nutrition recs
   - cont TF
s, check for residuals
   - will diurese with IV lasix today
   - f/u pm lytes
   # Anemia: Hct down to currenlty stable at  26.0 today from 26.4
   yesterday but decreased from [**3-12**] when it was 34. Patient with baseline
   anemia of chronic inflammation and acute drop likely dilutional after
   fluid repletion as all cell counts down.
   - daily Hct
   - Transfuse for Hct <21
   - Active T&S
   # Liver cirrhosis/ascites - Likely secondary to GVHD c/b portal HTN,
   esophageal varices, ascites.  Coags and LFT
s stable.
   - Trend LFT
s, coags
   # Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p allo BMT, GVHD: Most recent PET scan with
   no evidence of recurrent disease. Patient remains in remission.
   - Monitor counts and toxicities
   - Cellcept 250mg PO BID
   - Bactrim DS 1 tab M/W/F
   - Acyclovir 400mg q8H
   - Prednisone 20mg qAM, 10mg qPM
   - f/u BMT recs
   # Depression: In the context of prolonged ICU course and need for
   further interventions.
   - Followed by BMT social work.
   # Hypothyroidism: Normal TSH & free T4 from [**1-/3264**]
   - Continue Levothyroxine 125mcg PO daily
   # Gastric varices:  Not likely bleeding as no blood in stomach after
   Dobhoff placement.
   - Continue Metoprolol 12.5 mg PO BID
