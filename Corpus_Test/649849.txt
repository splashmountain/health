   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F c h/o RA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic AS who initially
   presented for elective valvuloplasty, now s/p ruptured right groin
   pseudoaneurysm and repair.
   # S/P tracheostomy: Reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation
   attempts.  On trach mask with good oxygen saturation.
   - monitoring acid-base status with ABG.  last ABG shows evidence of
   respiratory alkalosis.  Could be [**3-1**] pain response.  Continuing pain
   control c morphine.  S+S saw her again, as need to eval for ability to
   swallow
   - Trach management per thoracics, downsized to #6
   - Continue Passimure trial, able to make good effort, but not able to
   voice, CT showed edema.
   - will discuss methods for reducing inflamation with ENT
   .
   #Vomiting/Nutrition:  Possibly related to fentanyl induced
   gastroparesis and inability to check tube feed residuals, though
   vomiting was mostly bilious. Patient pulled out OG tube on [**11-29**].
   Pulled out dobhoff [**11-30**].  Doing well with Zofran, reduced opiates.
   Dobhoff replaced yesterday, restarting tubefeeds.
   - standing zofran fixed nausea
   - Re-start tubefeeds
   .
   # leukocytosis/UTI: multiple reasons
 right groin incision, dvt, uti,
   underlying RA, tracheostomy/possible pneumonia (CXR
 retrocardiac
   opacity), chronic steroid use.  Last diff 97 PMN / 1 lymph / 2 mono
   without bandemia. Continues to downtrend.  Found to have klebsiella
   UTI.  WBC increased after off cipro, added on differential.   Other Bcx
   are negative so far.
   - completed ciprofloxacin, trend CBC
   - f/u cultures, CXR read CIS
   - f/u differential,
   - f/u reculture before empiric coverage.
   .
   # Pseudoaneursym s/p repair: Vascular surgery is following. Hct
   initially trended down with repeat after two units from 29-31, but now
   stable.  U/S of R groin shows no evidence of continued aneurysm.  On
   [**11-27**], right groin site had increased swelling and hematoma, reeval for
   hematoma.  Had mild resp. alkalosis
 vent readjusted, resolved.
   - continuing to trend Hct, remaining stablem, serial right leg exam,
   holding heparin
   - If suspect re-bleed, will R-CT of R leg, surgery onboard.
   - appropriate wound care, watch for infection.
   - pain control with oxycodone prn
 increased to q4h PRN
   - switched to PO dosaging now that she is able to swallow.
   -  Vascular placing wound vac
   - PT c/s
 need to eval prior to rehab placement.
   .
   # LUE DVT
 provoked, likely [**3-1**] cordis
   - serial left arm exam given thrombus in brachial and cephalic vein.
   - Serial measurement
   - No heparin after hematoma development on [**11-27**].
   .
   # UOP: Initially oliguric, but significantly positive over the last 24
   hours with UOP ~200 cc/hr. Renal function remains normal.  [**Month (only) 47**] be
   autodiuresis [**3-1**] remobilzation of third-spaced fluids.
   - continue to monitor; IVF if clinically volume depleted on exam
   - keep I/O negative given 8kg up.
   - goal is to boost UOP
   # A. tach: Curbside by EP yesterday suggested BB alone with no further
   management. Started metoprolol 25mg PO Q6H with good effect and no
   recurrence.
   - well controlled on metoprolol
   - bolus to even/slight positive I/O
   # delirium / agitation: Unclear etiology; could be ICU delirium vs.
   sundowning vs. infection vs. steroid-induced delirium vs. drug-induced
   (trazodone).  Rheum agrees that likely due to steroid induced
   delirium.  Currently not active. Hold all delirium inducing meds.  Much
   improved in last 24 hours.
   - consider olanzapine and haldol as needed.
   - standing PM zydis if agitated
   - rheum c/s -  cont. chronic steroid dose, watch for steroid induced
   delirium
   # Valves: s/p balloon valvuloplasty with good effect. No signs of
   volume overload currently.
   -Continue ASA 81mg
   # RA: Con't prednisone and methotrexate/leucovorin.  Will need to
   discuss with rheumatology how to dose DMARDs as patient cannot receive
   POs currently and MTX cannot be given via NGT.
   - starting leukovorin and hold SQ MTX for now
   - started po steroids
   - pain control with fentanyl patch and oxycodone
   # Hyperlipidemia: Con't statin
   FEN:  NPO for now, pt refusing Dobhoff.  Discuss Sedation and PEG with
   family
