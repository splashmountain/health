Chief Complaint: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD s/p
   MI, non-ischemic CMY (EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down and
   initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the floor
   for suspicion of GPC sepsis from HD line and hypotension responsive to
   IVF.
   24 Hour Events:
 MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING - At [**3161-10-9**] 10:30 AM
   -Got R shoulder Xray with more views to evaluate for trauma
   -CVVH started, continued overnight
   -ID recs - continue nafcillin and levaquin
      -continue flagyl, increase dose to 500 mg PO Q8
      -should have LP and TEE done within next day or two.
      -will continue to follow
   -Renal recs - CVVH, start Epo 3x/week
   -MRI discussed with radiology - should follow up final neurorad read
   tomorrow.  Preliminary read -
      -no signs of cord compression
      -significant degenerative changes from C3 to C7
      -grossly no sign of acute process
      -bilateral pleural effusions noted
   -acidosis on evening ABG's, switched to AC
   -post-AC gas actually showed increased acidosis, so RR increased from
   16 to 22 with improvement.

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
 [**Last Name 113**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 59 y.o. Male with HD dependent ESRD, CAD
   s/p MI, non-ischemic CMY (EF 35-40%) p/w 3 day h.o. malaise, found down
   and initially hyperkalemic with back pain. Pt transferred from the
   floor for suspicion of GPC sepsis from HD line and hypotension
   responsive to IVF.
   .
   ##. Sepsis: Given the hypotension, hypoglycemia, leukocytosis with +
   bld cultures, pulmonary abscess pt is currently in sepsis. Suspect
   source to be tunnelled catheter line. Pt currently has several blood
   cultures and line culture pending ALL CX NGTD FOR PAST 48 HOURS, bld
   cultures show MSSA. WBC still elevated, but decreased.  Low grade fever
   to 100.1.
   - On nafcillin (day 5) for MSSA and levo/flagyl (day 2) for ?
   aspiration pna as found down. will need to confirm with ID how long
   course of therapy is, likely will depend on TEE and MRI results
   -will require TEE; discussed yesterday
   -needs LP to evaluate for seeding to meninges, as per ID; but has been
   on antibiotics for days now, wondering if it will change management.
   Will discuss further with ID
   -no evidence of abscesses/emboli to brain on head CT.
   -non-contrast MRI obtained yesterday - no evidence of epidural abscess
   on prelim read, but will follow up on final read.
   -transplant surgery removed tunneled HD cath, will continue to follow
   cultures.
   -f/u pending blood cultures, no surveillance cx for today given 48hrs
   NGTD.
   -resent sputum cultures, pending.
   -appreciate ID recs .
   .
   # Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection after seizure.
   Continuing to have copious purulent secretions overnight. Also awaiting
   TEE. Mild respiratory acidosis on PSV, switched to AC overnight with
   slight improvement.
   -Unable to wean vent overnight - increased PS without significant
   improvement in CO2.
   -Will work more to wean after TEE
   -Will do therapeutic bronch /cultures today to help with purulent
   secretions
   .
   ##. Back Pain: Pt on admission was noted to have full body pain and
   specifically back pain. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was placed on a C-spine given his
   pain and underwent a C/T/L Spine CT with contrast which showed no gross
   abscess but did show the aforementioned lung abscesses.
   - shoulder Xrays negative for fracture.
   - so far have been unable to clear C-spine due to altered mental
   status.  Continue C-collar for now, clear when able.
   - Fentanyl boluses for pain control.
   - f/u final read of MRI of back to r/o epidural abscess
   .
   ##. ESRD: Pt currently HD dependent, was dialyzed 2 days ago, CVVH
   started yesterday, continuing into this morning.  Goal fluid balance
   even.
   - continue pt on Sevelamer TID and phoslo
   .
   ##. Non-Ichemic CMY: Pt's prior Echo in [**3159**] shows EF of 35-40% as well
   as left ventricular severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal to
   mid septal, anterior and inferior segments.
   - will continue to monitor fluid status
   - continue on Digoxin
   .
   ##. Seizure d.o.: Pt with seizure 2 nights ago, likely because did not
   receive oxcarbazepine (b/c no NGT present and felt to be aspiration
   risk by S&S). Will continue on home regimen of Levetiracetam,
   Oxcarbazepine now that patient has NGT.
   -20 min EEG ordered - read pending.
   -continue Keppra, switch back to PO now that pt has NGT.
   -no evidence of septic emboli on head CT.
   -appreciate neuro recs.
   .
   # elevated INR:
   -INR of 1.5 - stably elevated for past 2 days, likely [**3-6**] abx and npo.
   #Hypotension: currently on Levophed. Does not seem to be extremely
   responsive to fluids. Likely [**3-6**] sedation.
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   .
   #. FEN: tube feeds.  IVF boluses for hypotension. Will continue to
   follow electrolytes and replete as necessary.
   .
