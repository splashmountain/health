Final Report
CLINICAL HISTORY: 65-year-old man with PICC.

COMPARISON: [**2984-11-8**].

FINDINGS: In comparison to prior examination, the Swan-Ganz
catheter has been
removed. A right-sided IJ is incompletely visualized and seen
terminating
likely in the internal jugular. Left-sided PICC line is new with
its tip 2 cm
from the distal SVC. However, this is difficult to visualize on
this patient.


The lung volumes are extremely low. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
is enlarged
and unchanged. Endotracheal tube has been removed. Bilateral
pleural
effusions are once again seen, along with bilateral atelectasis.
There is
worsening mild pulmonary edema.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 65 year old male was admitted on [**11-8**] and underwent aortic
valve replacement with a 25mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 357**] tissue valve.  He
tolerated the procedure well and had a cross clamp time of 61
mins and total bypass time of 82 mins.  He was transferred to
the CVICU on Neo and Propofol and remained intubated overnight
because he was a difficult intubation.  He was extubated early
the next morning and required aggressive respiratory therapy and
diuresis that day.  POD#2 his epicardial pacing wires and chest
tubes were discontinued and he was transferred to the floor.He
has hx of PAF and had episodes of intermittent afib
postoperatvely. He was not on coumadin however pre-operatively
and it was started this admission.He will have his coumadin
managed by his cardiologist once discharged from rehab.  He
continued to progress and was discharged to rehab on POD#4 in
stable condition to [**Hospital 145**] nursing and rehab at [**Hospital1 2046**]
[**Location (un) 2255**]. Of note the Patinet was found to have 70-79% right
carotid stenosis  and 48-49% left carotid stenosis. He was
cleared for surgery and vascular service recommened that he have
f/u cartid ultrasound in 6 months. He was also seen by Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16161**] from neurology for evaluation of intermittent tingling of
left upper extremity. It was found to be related to a
radiculopathy given his history of cervical spine injury and
recommmended that he follow-up with her as an outpatient.
