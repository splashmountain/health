MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2972-10-27**]):    No MRSA isolated.

ECG [**2972-10-25**]:
Sinus tachycardia. Otherwise, normal tracing. No previous
tracing available for comparison.

Portable CXR [**2972-10-25**]:
SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The endotracheal tube terminates
approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube follows
a normal course terminating in the left upper quadrant.

Lung volumes are low. There is no focal consolidation. There is
linear
opacity at the left lung base and retrocardiac region is
compatible with
atelectasis. The heart size is normal. No appreciable pleural
effusion or
pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar
contours are normal. Mild prominence of the central pulmonary
vessels suggests volume overload. There is no pulmonary edema.

IMPRESSION: Endotracheal tube placement as above.
