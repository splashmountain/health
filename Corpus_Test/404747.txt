Chief Complaint:  Flank pain in setting of EtOH withdrawal/intoxication
   HPI:
   This is a 56 year old man with depression and history of alcohol abuse
   who comes after a binge period of drinking 1.5 pints of vodka a day for
   approximately the last five days, from a baseline of heavy drinking;
   presenting with symptoms of withdrawal starting last night; nausea and
   vomiting; and bilateral flank pain which he says he has had in the past
   and which in the past has resolved with fluids.
   .
   Last week he found out that he might need a hip replacement and he
   reports that this upset him enough that he greatly increased his rate
   of drinking. He stopped drinking last night and then came in this
   morning after having the above symptoms because "I couldn't handle it
   myself." He was most recently sober in [**Month (only) 23**] during a five week stay
   in the [**Hospital1 **]; upon finishing this program he "went right back to the
   bar" although he ramped up his consumption level slowly. He denies any
   history of seizures with withdrawal; in the past he has had tremors,
   nausea and vomiting, and depression as symptoms of withdrawal.
   .
   In addition he notes that he has not been taking his Effexor or his
   Concerta recently, and notes that as in the past the abrupt absence of
   Effexor is bringing on a feeling of "great sadness."
   .
   He says that his back pain is "kidney pain" which in the past has
   resolved in the hospital with aggressive hydration. He has not had
   sharp passing pains; it is more of a back ache. He denies fever, change
   in his urine, or burning with urination. He additionally denies
   shortness of breath, chest pain, bloody stool, diarrhea. He denies
   urethral discharge and has not been sexually active for a number of
   years.
   .
   In the emergency department, his vitals were:
   96.8 110 148/112 22 100%RA
   He received a banana bag, which was still running when he came up to
   the floor, and a total of 50 mg of IV valium in 10 mg doses. He also
   received 100 mg of IV thiamine; and was given Zofran prn for nausea.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a past history of alcohol abuse, who
   presents with flank pain and intoxication, with high requirements by
   CIWA scale for treatment of withdrawal in progress in the emergency
   department.
   .
   FLANK PAIN
   Presents with bilateral flank pain. No clear renal or GU pathology that
   easily explains this. CT abdomen/pelvis is negative by wet read for
   renal or abdominal pathology. Patient states this pain is usually
   resolved with fluids. Not clear why this is, but will give fluids.
   - ?renal ultrasound
   - fluids
   .
   ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL
   High requirements in the ED. Continuing CIWA scale. Needing close
   monitoring at this point given frequency of return of symptoms;
   however, hopefully should be able to complete latter part of withdrawal
   management on the floor.
   - continue CIWA q1/2 hr, valium for CIWA >10
   - zofran for nausea
   - holding home Concerta in setting of tachycardia, hypertension
   - continue low-dose home amlodipine
   - restart venlafaxine given interaction of EtOH w depression in this
   pt; likely having some venlafaxine w/d symptoms unrelated to EtOH w/d
   as well
   .
   TRANSAMINITIS
   ALT=AST, not suggestive of alcoholic hepatitis.
   - review for past hepatitis serologies in [**Hospital1 1640**] records via Logician
   - if not available, Hep B+C serologies
   - consider RUQ u/s for outpt f/u, not an ICU need
   - trend labs
   - continue effexor at home dose given that he has been stable on this,
   may need dose reduction if liver impairment increases
   .
   DEPRESSION
   On venlafaxine at home, has not been taking. Restart, as above.
   .
   ADHD
   On Concerta. Would hold in setting of acute alcohol withdrawal.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 56M EtOH abuse c/b withdrawal, elevated
   lactate and B flank pain.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.2 BP 134/78 HR 105 RR 19 with sat 95 on RA.
   Disheveled man, NAD, jovial. Coarse BS B. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. Labs
   notable for WBC 5K, HCT 40, K+ 3.7, Cr 0.8, lac 5.0.
   Agree with plan to manage EtOH withdrawal with transition to valium
   20mg q1h PO per CIWA. Will consult addiction services and will continue
   IVF until tolerating PO diet. Given lactate elevation on admission will
   give aggressive IV thiamine repletion, pan-culture, and continue
   hydration until taking better POs. Per report, flank pain has occurred
   on prior occasions when he had EtOH w/d
 monitor, no clear sign of
   infection or structural disease. Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Total time: 50 min
