   24 Hour Events:
   -TTE showed 25% EF, moderate MR, increased PCWP, pulm htn.
   -NTG drip discontinued in AM.
   -called to patient for hypoxia sat->92% on 4L at 1pm, found to have A-a
   gradient.  CXR and EKG unchanged.  Resolves spontaneously.  Broad
   spectrum vanc/cefepime/cipro started.
   -4pm - pt had shortness of breath, chest pain, again desat to 92%.  SL
   ntg given x2 with initial resolution of sx, lasix 40mg IV given, all IV
   fluid stopped.  pain returned, morphine 1mg given.
   -8pm - pt again had chest pain, shortness of breath.  Tachy to 120s,
   cardiac enzymes noted to be slightly uptrending.  Thought to be demand
   ischemia in setting of possible PE.  Ntg drip started.  Symptoms
   resolved as HR dropped to low 100s.
   -1am - patient acutely short of breath.  Gas showed acute on chronic
   respiratory acidosis, worsening of hypercarbia.  Given nebs, steroids.
   Also given 40mg lasix for possible volume overload.  CPAP tried ->
   stopped after 5 minutes because of discomfort.  Family notified of
   situation.
   -6am - family at bedside, patient continued to be delirious, O2 sats
   down to 88% on 6L NC.  Good urine output to lasix, but no improvement

   Assessment and Plan
   81-year-old female with history of CAD s/p multiple MIs, CABG 4v,
   presents to outside hospital with new lung mass, post obstructive
   pneumonia, who subsequently developed chest pain after albuterol
   nebulization treatment.
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient with chest discomfort, stable on NTG gtt and
   Heparin gtt.  Patient with a history of CABG x 4 in [**3270**].  [**3273**] cath
   showed Patent SVG-OM3. Occluded proximal SVG-D1-OM2 with patent D1-OM2
   jump segment. Atretic LIMA-LAD.  Patient has [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2 to mid LAD.
   Unclear if patient's episode of CP represents UA, however is CP free on
   hep gtt and ntg gtt.  CE shows Neg CK and Trop 0.02. Patient unable to
   lie flat due to dyspnea.
   - Cont ASA
   - Cont Plavix
   - Cont Hep gtt
   - Cont NTG gtt - wean off today
   - TTE today
   - EKG AM
   - Cont Statin
   - Cont beta blocker
 increase today
   .
   # Rhythm:  Sinus tachycardia. Unclear if related to anxiety, versus
   other etiologies such as PE.  Patient currently stable on 2-3L NC with
   sats in mid 90s.  No LE edema, currently on hep gtt which would be
   treatment for PE.
   - Monitor for now, continue Hep gtt
   - Consider imaging for PE
 will get CTA to better eval for PE and eval
   mass for IP
   .
   # Lung mass: New RUL lung mass.  OSH CT describes it as a 6x6x5cm
   lobulated mass, which is new since her prior imaging and is concerning
   for malignancy given her extensive smoking history.
   - Consult IP in AM
   .
   # COPD exacerbation:  Stable on 2-3L NC.
   - Continue Ipratropium nebs
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   - Avoid albuterol due to tachycardia
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology. Worrisome for possible post
   obstructive pneumonia. Has been coughing up yellow sputum past [**3-10**]
   days. Afebrile. Received steroids at OSH which may cause leukocytosis.
   Will continue to monitor patient for signs of infection, culture as
   appropriate.
   - hold abx for now
   - trend WBC, T
   - follow up cultures
   - culture if spikes
   - start antibiotics if spikes
   - consider bronch BAL samples
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: give insulin to control sugars, small dose of
   kayexalate.
   - repete K, give more kayexalate if needed
   .
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: unclear baseline. Elevated since [**3273**].
   OSH 1.6.
   - IVF prn
   - urine lytes if needed
   - mucomyst and hydration prior and after CT
   .
   # Hypertension: wean off NTG drip today
   - beta blocker if tolerates
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Continue statin as above.
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient was maintained on ISS.
   - adjust ISS prn
