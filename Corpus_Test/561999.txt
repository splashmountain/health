   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo F with COPD, DM, HTN, HLP, morbid obesity, who is transferred
   from an OSH for worsening SOB found to have a large pericardial
   effusion with tamponade physiology on ECHO- unable to perform
   pericardiocentesis today in cath lab due to position of pericardial
   effusion.
   # Pericardial Effusion: unknown etiology- possibilities include post
   viral, malignant, autoimmune, infectious, hemorrhagic (unlikely).
   Malignant highly possible given age and size of effusion and that it's
   now causing symptoms.  Currently hemodynamically stable.
   - monitor in CCU overnight for HD stability
   - plan for cardiac surgery consult for ? pericardial window
   - IVFs PRN hypotension overnight
   - monitor pulsus
   # CORONARIES: no known coronary disease
   - on b-blocker from OSH- no record of this being a home med; not on ASA
   as outpatient; only on statin
   # No evidence of heart failure; will continue home PO lasix
   # RHYTHM:  NSR
   # COPD: cont home meds
   - PRN albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - prednisone taper for COPD flare
   # DM: insulin ss
   # HTN: cont b-blocker and lasix
   # Hyperlipidemia: cont home statin
   # Hypothyroidism: cont home levothyroxine
   FEN:  cardiac/DM diet; NPO after midnight for potential drain vs window
   tomorrow
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots; hold off on hep sc given effusion
   -Pain managment with tylenol PRN
   -Bowel regimen
