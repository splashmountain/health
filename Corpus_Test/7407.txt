History of Present Illness:
48 y/o F DM type 1, ESRD s/p CRT x 2 most recently in [**9-24**],

where tele demonstrated a 8 sec pause. Consequently patient was
admitted to the CCU for further care.

.
CXR [**9-9**]:
Pacer placement with no evidence of complication. Small right
pleural effusion.
.
ECG [**9-8**]:
Normal sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block with QRS duration

of 122 milliseconds. The patient now has T wave inversion in
leads V3-V6 that was not seen in tracing #1. These changes are
non-specific.
.
ECHO [**3389-9-8**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**3387-12-13**], a
pacer, TR and pulmonary hypertension are now seen.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
#1 Paroxysmal AV block S/P pacer: Etiology included ischemia,
viral myocarditis, lyme disease, endocarditis, thyroid disease
paroxysmal AV block, most likely infranodal block (vs. nodal).
Initially had temp wire placed by the bedside, pt now s/p dual
chamber pacemaker, right subclavian access. CXR showed good lead
placement. Lyme serolgy (-), blood culture (-), ESR mildly
elevated -> endocarditis unlikely; TSH normal. ECHO showed no
wall motion abnormalities, no vegetation. Pt was discharged home
with 1 day of prophylactic antibiotics and follow up with device
clinic and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
#2 CORONARIES: No chest pain or history of angina. [**3389-1-21**]
stress test demonstrated mild small perfusion defect in LAD
region. Patient being treated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for medical
management. No evidence of ischemia during stay with negative
biomarkers. Pt was continued on Aspirin, Pravastatin and Zetia.
.
#3 S/P Renal transplant: Creatinine at baseline 08-1.2. No
fever, chills to suggest infection. Was followed by transplant
team during hospital stay. Tacro level OK. No changes in
immunosuppressant regimen.
.
#4 Diabetes type 1: Elevated BS on admission. A1C 10. Husband
and pt admit to poor control at home. Already involved with
[**Hospital **] clinic. No changes in insulin regimen. Pt was encouraged
to visit [**Last Name (un) **] endocrinologist and nutritionist after
discharge.
.
# Hypertension: Patient unaware she is on Valsartan 40 mg qd.
Hold now as patient is normotensive and told to speak to her PCP
about this medicine.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued Pravastatin 20 mg and Ezetimibe 10
mg
.
# Recurrent UTI's 2 neurogenic bladder: Patient Ua on admission
negative. Recently completed two week course of ciprofloxacin.
.
# Hepatitis C: No stigmata of chronic liver disease on exam.
Most recent LFTs mildly elevated. Most recent Hep C viral load
[**3389-1-19**] 948,000.
