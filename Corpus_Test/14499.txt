HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 18514**] is a 56 year-old
male who was a transfer from [**Hospital3 2675**] Hospital
following a thrombotic transient ischemic attack presumed to
be from his right internal carotid and a possible small non Q
wave myocardial infarction.  He was transferred for cardiac
catheterization following a positive stress test revealing
inferior and anterior apical artery reversible defects with
an EF of 25 to 30%.  Two dimensional echocardiogram done at
[**Hospital3 2675**] revealed a mild MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] presently complains
of symptoms of left sided weakness as well as a throat
burning with exertion typically ambulating one flight of
stairs.

1.0.  His total cholesterol was 220 with an HDL of 35 and an
LDL of 143.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Performed post procedure while on a
nitro drip, his blood pressure is 90/45.  Heart rate is 64.
Oxygen saturations is 94% on room air.  In general he is a

Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q day.  3.  Lasix 20 mg po q
day.  4.  Digoxin 0.125 mg po q day.  5.  Glucotrol XL 10 mg
po q day.  6.  NPH 5 units q.a.m.  7.  Calcium carbonate 1250
mg po day.  8.  Nicotine patch.  9.  Ativan 1 mg po b.i.d.
10.  Pravachol 10 mg po q day.  11.  Zestril 10 mg po q day.
12.  Lopressor 25 mg po b.i.d.  13.  Imdur 30 mg po q day.
14.  Lovenox 60 mg subQ q 12 hours.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiology
Service where he had a cardiac catheterization demonstrating
three vessel disease.  Both the Vascular Surgery team and the
Cardiac Surgery teams were consulted for his symptomatic
transient ischemic attack and his coronary disease.  He had a
carotid ultrasound that demonstrated less then 40% internal
carotid stenosis bilaterally.  The Neurosurgery team was
asked to come and evaluate him.  They found based on his MR
angiogram done at the outside hospital.  He had right
internal carotid stenosis in the area of the petrous bone.
He was taken to angiography where he had a cerebral angiogram
that confirmed these findings.  On [**3369-6-29**] the patient
had a cerebral angiogram with stent angioplasty of the
petrous right internal carotid artery.  The patient's
procedure itself was unremarkable.  Post procedure he was
started on Integrilin.  Of note, they also believed that he
has a right subclavian steel syndrome.  The patient was
continued on Integrilin for several post procedure days.  All
of his neurologic checks were without deficits.  His
Integrilin was stopped at midnight the night prior to his
operation.

On [**3369-7-3**] the patient was taken to the Operating Room
for a coronary artery bypass graft times five.  His grafts
are left internal mammary coronary artery to left anterior
descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to left PD,
posterior descending coronary artery sequential and saphenous
vein graft to obtuse marginal to saphenous vein graft to
diagonal done end to side.  The patient's cardiopulmonary
bypass time was 114 minutes.  Cross clamp time was 93
minutes.  Postoperatively, the patient was taken to the
Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit.  He was extubated on the
evening of his operation.  He was started on Plavix post
procedure and over the course of the first postoperative day
he was weaned from multiple drips including nitroglycerin,
insulin and Nipride.  On the afternoon of the first
postoperative day he was transferred to the hospital floor.
His Foley catheter was discontinued in a normal fashion.  His
Lopressor was titrated up based on his heart rate and blood
pressure.  He was ambulating with physical therapy.  He had
oxygen requirement for several days, but by the day prior to
his discharge he had been adequately diuresed and no longer
required oxygen while at rest.

[**Last Name (STitle) 18515**]evelop a low grade temperature to 100.0 on
postoperative day number five with some scant sternal
drainage.  For this reason his sternum was painted with
betadine and he was started on oral Levaquin therapy.  By the
following day the drainage was noted to be very scant from
the interior edge of his dressing and it was felt he was safe
to be discharged home.  He was discharged home on [**3369-7-9**] in stable condition in the care of his family with
visiting nurse assistance.  He was instructed to follow up
with his primary care physician in one to two weeks. In
addition, he is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in four
weeks and to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 133**] [**Name (STitle) 134**] with Neurosurgery
in approximately three months.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  1.  Lopressor 50 mg po b.i.d.  2.
Pravachol 10 mg po q day.  3.  Nicotine patch 14 mg
transdermal q day.  4.  Glipizide XL 5 mg po q day.  5.  NPH
5 units subQ q.a.m.  6.  Plavix 75 mg po q day.  7.  Enteric

9.  Levaquin 500 mg po q day times seven days.  10.  Lasix 20
mg po b.i.d. times seven days.  11.  Potassium chloride 20
milliequivalents po b.i.d. times seven days.  12.  Percocet
one to two po q 4 to 6 hours prn.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease now status post coronary artery
bypass graft times five.
2.  Right intracranial internal carotid artery stenosis now
status post angioplasty and stent.
3.  Hypertension, controlled.
4.  Diabetes mellitus, controlled.
5.  Hyperlipidemia, controlled.
