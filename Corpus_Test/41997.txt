Conclusions
Prebypass

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**2-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 222**] was notified in person of the results on
[**2986-10-24**] at 11:00 am.

Post bypass

Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine.
LVEF= 45%. Mild mitral regurgitation persists. Aorta is intact
post decannulation.

Poor transgastric views.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 15396**] was admitted under cardiac surgery and underwent
routine preoperative evaluation. He remained pain free on
medical therapy. Workup was unremarkable and he was cleared for
surgery. On [**10-24**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 222**] performed coronary
artery bypass grafting surgery. For surgical details, please see
operative note. Following surgery, he was brought to the CVICU
for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without incident. He was
transfused with PRBC for a postoperative anemia. His CVICU
course was otherwise uneventful and he transferred to the SDU on
postoperative day one. Beta blockade was initially held for
bradycardia. He was also noted to have a rise in creatinine
associated with hyperkalemia which prompted treatment with
Kayexalate. His creatinine peaked to 2.1 but by discharge, his
creatinine returned to baseline. Potassium levels also
normalized.He went into A Fib and was started on amiodarone as
well as coumadin.He continued to work on strength and mobility
with PT. Insulin adjusted for tighter BS management. Chest tubes
and pacing wires removed per protocol.  Minor erythema developed
at the inferior pole of the sternal incision.  There was no
drainage, and the sternum was stable.  He is started on
Levaquin.  The patient is discharged home on POD 4 with
appropriate follow-up instructions.
