Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 516**]
Chief Complaint:
syncope at OSH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization
EGD
cabg x3 on [**1-22**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM1, SVG to OM2)


History of Present Illness:
75 year old woman with hx of NIDDM, HTN presented to OSH on
[**1-12**] after 2 episodes of syncope at home. Patient was getting
out of her bed when she became lightheaded and syncopized. After
reviving, patient apparently syncopized again. CEs negative x 3
at OSH. Patient had stress test on [**1-14**]; initially stopped for
hypotension (SBP - 70s); but restarted after patient responded
to fluid bolus. Upon returning from stress test, patient
developed "jaw pain radiating to her chest." CEs at this time
became positive: CK: 386 and Trop 5.58. SUbsequent [**Location (un) 615**] of
her stress revealed fixed, inferior defects and reversible
anterolateral/anteroapical defects.

An EKG was done which showed: ST depressions V2-V6, I, L with ST
elevation in III only.

Started on integrillin gtt, heparin gtt, loaded with 300mg
plavix, and ASA 325mg adn SL NTG.  Txferred to [**Hospital1 22**] for cath.
In the cath lab, found to have low filling pressures, 3VD and
LCx/DM1 was ballooned. During the catheterization, the Hct
returned at 19 (was 34 at OSH). Lavage (+) in CCU with coffee
grounds. Transfused 3U PRBC. Heparin held. Referred to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for CABG surgery. Was monitored for her GI bleed for
several days prior to operation due to the need for systemic
heparinization.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 75 yo originally presented to OSH with syncope and later
developed NSTEMI. At [**Hospital1 **], 3VD via cath and post sclerosis of
gastric ulcer.
.
#Cardiac:
#Ischemia:
- NSTEMI at OSH
- 3VD - via cath on [**1-14**] -> PTCA of OM1
[**1-16**]-> CT surgery being put off till next week because of her
gastric ulcer. She needs to stay in house because of the 3VD to
monitor
- On ASA, statin, BBlocker (titrated down for hypotension)
- if BP can tolerate, consider adding on Lisinopril

- holding heparin and integrilin in setting of GI bleed
.
# Pump
- ECHO showed 45% EF with akinesis/hypokinesis of inferior and
inferiolateral segments; mild-symmetric LVH
- CI: 3.2 on [**1-15**]
- low central pressures - probably indicative of GI bleed or
dehydration.
- IABP -> pulled on [**1-15**]
.
# Rhythm: Sinus tach to 100s
.
# GIB:
- EGD from [**1-15**] showed esophagitis and gastric ulcer that was
sclerosed
- continue Protonix gtt and needs rescope in 6 weeks
- got 4U PRBC on [**1-15**] - 2 for hypotension/low hct and 2 more
for hct<30.
- hct goal>30 for CT surgery
- q6 Hcts
- started on clears as per GI
.
- probably a result from the combination of heparin, integrilin,
ASA, 300mg Plavix
- Lavage returned dark blood; Guaiac positive, but no frank
blood on glove
- patient Hct 34 at OSH; 18.5 here at [**Hospital1 22**] found after cath
- [**2887-1-13**]: 3U PRBC
- [**2888-1-15**]: 4 Units PRBC
.
# DM
- Hold glucotrol
- Started insulin drip on [**1-15**]
.
# PPX:
- Protonix gtt
- SC heparin
- NPO for procedure
.
# FEN:
- NPO
.
# Syncope:
- likely from GIB/MI . Currently AAOx3.
.
# Code:
- full code
IABP removed prior to surgery. GI consult obtained- EGD showed
gastric ulcer.

Underwent cabg x3 on [**1-22**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Transferred to the CSRU
in stable condition on epinephrine and propofol drips. Extubated
that evening  and Swan DCed on POD #1. Gentle diuresis was
started and neo drip weaned off. Chest tubes removed on POD #2
and transferred to the floor. She went into Afib that evening
and was started on amiodarone. Beta blockade was titrated for
rate control. Converted to SR on POD #4 and pacing wires were
removed without incident. She made good progress increasing her
activity level and was discharged to home with VNA on POD #6.
She will need f/u with the GI service for repeat endoscopy in 4
weeks.
