Chief Complaint:
Increasing episodes of heart failure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**3004-4-24**] Redo sternotomy, Coronary artery bypass graft x2
(saphenous vein graft > RAMUS, saphenous vein graft > posterior
descending artery)


History of Present Illness:
74 year old gentleman with complex past medical history and
multiple comorbidities who underwent coronary artery bypass
surgery in [**2974**]. He suffered a reinfarction in [**2986**] and ICD
placement for a ventricular fibrillation arrest. More recently
he has been having multiple episodes of heart failure, a
pulseless
electrical activity arrest following anesthesia and recently
suffered a myocardial infarction on [**3004-2-22**] following surgery to
removed a squamous cell skin cancer from his left temporal
region. He was admitted to [**Hospital3 448**] [**Hospital3 **] where he
underwent a recatheterization revealing native left main and
three vessel disease along with two of three vein grafts
occluded. His vein graft to the left anterior descending artery
was patent. Given that he needs further surgery with regards to
his left temporal squamous cell skin cancer, he has been
referred for evaluation for a redo CABG prior to any further
surgical
procedures. It is felt that he is rather high risk to undergo
general anesthesia for any further surgery without his coronary
disease first being addressed. Given the severity of his disease
and complexity of his situation, he has been referred to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for further evalutation.   He is admitted today for
further pre-op workup and heparin bridge.  Last dose of coumadin
was Wednesday, [**3004-4-18**].
