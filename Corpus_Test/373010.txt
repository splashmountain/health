   Assessment and Plan
   1) Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure:
   Improved oxygenation and aeration on CXR.
   Wean FiO2.
   Continue empiric steroids, antibiotics pending rest of her studies.
   Diurese gently.
   2) Renal failure:
   Creatinine rising despite psotive fluid balance.
   U/a with some blood--renal consult and check sediment considerering GN.
   3) Anemia:
   Hct stablized.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known patient lastname 8074**] has had gradual improvement in oxygenation with higher
   PEEP and ongoing Rx for DAH with high dose steroids. Her Hct is now at
   28, creatinine at 1.8 ( with diuresis) and she is off pressors!. She is
   responsive to pain despite current sedation levels. Her U/A shows
   evidence for RBC
s. CXR also shows mild interval clearing. We will
   continue Abx per ID staff recs, give 24 more hours of high dose
   steroids, then taper to 40 mg prednisone as we await serology and begin
   attempts to wean on ventilator when FiO2 is down to 40% as is required
   PEEP. Etiology of DAH still unclear at this time ( vasculitis vs
   DAD/CHF). Family has been updated.
   Patient is critically ill
