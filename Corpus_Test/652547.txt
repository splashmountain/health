   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo F c HTN, DM, HLP p/w acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Neuro: Limited progression [**1-5**] need for opiates.  Patch reduced from
   100mg to 50mg.
   - waking up overnight with less fentanyl
   - continue fentanyl patch for pain
   - d/c fentanyl gtt, switch to IV boluses for pain
   - doing well off lactulose
   .
   # Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory: S/P BMS to
   LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more hemodynamically stable.
   Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9),
   now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic
   / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of compartment sx in LLE.  Reached
   goal CVP >12 for [**Month/Day (2) **] resuscitated.  in NSR/sinus tach but had an
   episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off temp pacer at this time.  last
   TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient had been on heparin gtt but
   stopped [**1-5**] bleeding concerns.  Off pressors and tolerated -2L
   yesterday.  s/p an episode of atrial fibrillation, converted back to
   sinus without BB.   Since, she had additional episodes of afib that is
   rate controlled and she converts back to sinus on her own.  While in
   AFib, she drops her pressure.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, BB no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - f/u AM CXR, CK
   - f/u Echo this AM
   - restarted CVVH [**1-5**] poor uop
 I/O even for now.
   - continue pressure support on neo (phenylephrine)
   - Echo to evaluate cardiac function or wall motion abnormalities as a
   source for her persistent pressor need
   .
   # Afib/Aflutter: Ms [**Known patient lastname 9092**] seems to go in and out of Atrial Fibrillation
   on a nightly basis.  On [**10-16**] she was noted to be in flutter briefly at
   a rate of 140.  She broke with carotid massage, and 5mg of IV
   metoprolol.
   - discontinue metoprolol as in the setting of shock her BP will not
   tolerate
   - continue amiodarone load for rhythm control
   - holding AC at this time given bleeding issue
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 42**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status have hindered the process
   of weaning.  Tolerating increasing courses of pressure support, however
   tired out and required A/C.  Continue sedation holidays, pressure
   support and trach mask trials.
   - She does well on trach mask throughout the day and routinely retains
   CO2 towards the end of the evening
   - monitor [**Last Name (Titles) **] status and RR, continue trach mask trials
   - this AM on CPAP ABG revealed metabolic acidosis without respiratory
   compensation
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having regular BMs off of lactulose.  NGT
   found to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per
   GI. Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. Had
   melenotic/frankly bloody bm [**10-7**], put on IV PPI.  Off lactulose had
   roughly 230cc of stool yesterday.
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - INR nearly normal, no need for FFP, vitamin K
   - BM regimen, hold lactulose
   - on tube feeds, tolerating advanced diet
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   required CVVH.  Urine output now improving, 310cc yesterday with -2L on
   CVVH
   - per Renal recs, holding CVVH for now to see if patient has good UOP.
   Will restart today as patient cannot tolerate being off CVVH.
   - Hyperkalemia discussed with renal, who asked us not to give
   kayexalate and will remove in HD
   .
   # ID:  WBC elevated with elevated fevers and likely wound infection.
   Patient with multiple nidi, including triple lumen, CVVH line, sacral
   skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being open and foley
   catheter.
   - f/u fungal cultures, bcx, sputum cx, UCX,
   - Glucan (-), Galactomanan- low intermediate, C. Diff (-)
   -  Restarting Vanc and adding Zosyn to cover her likely leg infection
   - continue diflucan for yeast in sputum waiting for speciation.
   - wbc falling
   - culture if spikes
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy is likely [**1-5**] /hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.
   - Transfuse prn if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct > 25.
   - Transfuse FFP if INR rise or bleeding continues, goal INR < 1.5
   - appreciate and follow - heme-onc regarding the
   anemia/thrombocytopenia.
   - renal to discuss epo
   .
   # compartment sx
 Likely developed [**1-5**] IABP use.  IABP now removed,
   patient s/p LLE fasciotomy.  Wound VAC placed.
   -    followed by Vsurg
  wound VAC
 input appreciated
   -    serial pulses, CK (lowest)
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Markedly elevated. Likely shock liver and rhabdo.
   -  Now WNL
   .
   # IDDM
 insulin gtt, [**Last Name (un) **]-stim is negative for adrenal insufficiency
   .
   # HTN: Hold home hypertensive regimen until more HD stable.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia
 Holding statin in setting of rhabdomyolysis /
   transaminitis pending CPK<1000.
   .
   # FEN: Trialing [**Last Name (LF) 9005**], [**First Name3 (LF) 114**] advance as tolerated.
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   - DVT ppx if HCT stable
 SQ heparin
   - pain management IV fentanyl
   - bowel regimen (senna + colace), lactulose
