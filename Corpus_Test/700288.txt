   admissions for hypoglycemia who presents with hypoglycemia and
   unresponsiveness and is transferred to the MICU for further management.
   # Hypothermia/unresponsiveness:  Resolved, likely in setting of
   hypoglycemia.  TFTs stable and SDH resolving.  Sepsis also possible
   though less likely.
   - management of DM1 as below
   - cont thiamine and mvi
   - f/u culture data
   - f/u head CT final read
   # Positive blood cultures: has GPR on blood cx from [**3310-2-18**].  DDx
   includes listeria, clostridium, bacillus anthracis.  [**Month (only) 56**] be related to
   nausea.
   - repeat bcx
   - would start clinda/cipro/ampicilin if spikes
   # Diabetes I:  History of recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia.  On
   prednisone, Mycophenolate from rhuem.
   - check FS Qachs for now
   - cont lanus and HISS
   - continue prednisone
   - patient refusing mycohpenolate; started by rheumatologist and patient
   states he does not understand the indication for this medication, will
   need to clarify
   - [**Last Name (un) 257**] reccs cont current regimen
   - SPEP with IgM monoclonal spike on SPEP to 368 on last admission,
   consider repeat rheum consult for ? of autoimmune process causing
   hypoglycemia and potential of initiating rituximab (has been treated
   with IVIG in the past)
   # History of SDH:  Found on head CT in [**1-8**] for evaluation for
   agitation/AMS.  Seen by neurosurg and thought to be chronic, not
   intervened upon.
   - holding heparin, ASA
   - f/u head CT
   # ESRD on HD:  On HD qTThSat, last session on Saturday.
   - renal reccs
   - got HD yesterday
   - Cont nephrocaps, calcitriol, and TID calcium carbonate
   # HTN:
   - holding BP meds
   # [**Doctor Last Name 573**] disease:
