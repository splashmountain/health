   Assessment and Plan
   39 yo male with NHL, s/p allo BMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and
   bronchiolitis obliterans, now trached for repeated hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, here for fever and hypoxia, likely secondary to
   VAP.
   .
   # VAP
 Bandemia stable from priors.  Chest CT showed improvement of
   left, but worsening of right basilar consolidation.  Positive BCx and
   sputum cx for Klebsiella pneumoniae; antibiogram indicates that this is
   not ESBL.  Respiratory status remains stable on ventilator. Low IgG,
   given IVIG on [**4-1**].
    - [**Last Name (un) 411**] D8, Tobra D4 (Klebsiella PNA, sputum and BCx speciation and
   sensitivities confirmed); same bacteria at [**Hospital1 **] OSH
   - f/u repeat glucan
   - f/u ID recs
   - placement of picc line after becoming afebrile for > 24hrs
   -check tobra level with am labs tomorrow
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Patient with bronchiolitis obliterans and
   profound muscle weakness leading to chronic respiratory failure and
   tracheostomy, still vent-dependent.  Now with likely VAP.
   - treatment for VAP as above
   - tolerating PSV well
   - febrile episodes could be related to aspiration events; repositioned
   nasointestinal tube,
   - continue vent support as needed, with ultimate plan to wean to trach
   collar as tolerated
   .
   # hypotension
 Patient with low-normal BP during this admission,
   consistent with blood pressure seen during prior admission.  Now
   resolved.
   - holding aldactone, BB
   - monitor BP, UOP
   .
   # anemia
 Patient with Hct drop 28.4 to 23.5, Could have dilutional
   component as patient was given IVF upon admission because of fever,
   bandemia, hypotension. Given one unit and now at 32.7.
   - continue to trend Hct
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # elevated INR
 1.5 on admission.  Likely [**2-5**] malnutrition +/-
   malabsorption. Now 1.0-1.1 after vitamin K
   - continue to trend INR
   .
   # ARF
 Cr 0.5 on admission, up from baseline of 0.2.  Now resolved.
   - continue to monitor UOP
   - IVF as needed
   .
   # h/o NHL s/p allo BMT c/b GVHD
 Most recent PET scan with no evidence
   of recurrent disease and he remains in remission.   GVHD is underlying
   cause for patient
s liver dysfunction and bronchiolitis obliterans.
   IgG levels low during this admission (197).
   - continue prednisone, mycophenolate
   - Bactrim, acyclovir, voriconazole ppx
   - IVIG given, trend LFTs
   - f/u BMT recs
   - add Creon for digestion aid
   .
   # HLP
 Continue simvastatin.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism
 Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # FEN
 tube feeds (Peptamen 1.5), repeat as needed.  As patient
   Vitamin A was low, patient
s Vitamin K level was likely low (given
   elevated INR on admission),and patient
s Vitamin D level borderline
   insufficient, this may indicate malabsorption.  Discuss with Nutrition
   / BMT whether tube feeds and/or supplements should be adjusted, as well
   as whether restarting Creon or other enzyme supplementation is
   warranted.
