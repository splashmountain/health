   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo F w/ a h/o CHF (EF of 20-30%), carotid stenosis, no CAD from cath
   [**12-26**], and h/o LBBB s/p BiV pacer presents as OSH transfer with ?sepsis,
   atrial fibrillation w/ RVR and demand ischemia.
   .
   # Infection: FUO, Complicated by Afib w/ RVR in setting of EF 20%. Pt
   with history of enterobactor sensitive to [**Last Name (un) **]/cefepime. Was started on
   zosyn and switched to imipenem at OSH.  Appears euvolemic on exam.
   - f/u OSH Urine cx, blood Cx data
 so far no positive data
   - after d/w rads, felt that CXR probably not indicative of PNA, likely
   edema instead
   - on meropenem and azithromycin [**5-24**] day course given prior cx data and
   multiple drug allergies
   - ID consulted recs as above
   - DFA
 Neg, C.Diff- Negative x 3, OSH line pulled
 tip pending. UCX-
   Negative here, BCX
 negative thus far
   - LFTs normal, CT A/P showed no infectious source
   .
   # Altered/Depressed MS
 thought to be [**12-19**] to ativan yesterday, not
   retaining CO2, toxic-metabolic
   - head CT -> WNL
   - lactulose was trialed [**10-5**] yesterday with no improvement
   - no appreciable response to stress dose steroids x 2d, will d/c [**10-7**]
   - TSH WNL; fT4, T3 slightly low but doubtful to be responsible for this
   clinical picture
   - NEURO: agrees with current workup and treatment plan, consider LP if
   patient spikes through abx coverage
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Baseline 1.3-1.5, creatinine 2.6 on
   presentation to OSH.  Cr has improved with hydration but azotemia
   continues.
   - give fluid as needed, currently has hyperchloremic metabolic
   acidosis, consider bicarb as needed
   - started maintenance fluids, addl boluses as tolerated
   - azotemia persists despite hydration; renal feels that this remains
   [**12-19**] pre-renal insufficiency
   - no renal findings on CT
   .
   # supertherapeutic INR: likely due to drug drug interaction (amio vs.
   flagyl vs abx), liver dysfunction, inhibitor screen.
   - amio d/c
d, inhibitor screen-wnl
   - now downtrending after amio was d/ced
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Afib, now rate controlled - likely worsened by underlying
   sepsis. Anticoagulated with therapeutic INR since admission at OSH.
   - initially treated with amio, but now d/ced [**12-19**] interaction with
   warfarin
   - continue rate control with BB
   - holding coumadin in setting of supratherapeutic INR
   .
   # PUMP: s/p BiV placement [**7-26**]. Reports using lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] at home
   although no record from OSH. Euvolemic on admission.
   - continue statin, aspirin
   - IVF with I/O goal of 1L+.
   .
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD as per cath [**12-26**]. Likely demand ischemia in
   setting of urosepsis compounded by acute on chronic renal failure.
   - aspirin and statin, holding carvedilol until off of pressors
   - d/c asa.
   .
   # Chronic C. Diff: No evidence of recurrence
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - continue home synthroid dose
   .
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis: Chronic 5mg prednisone steroid use, although
   not completely clear most recent use. No evidence of adrenal
   insufficency from this low dose. Did receive hydrocort 100mg IV x1 at
   OSH on day of transfer.
   - d/ced stress dose steroids
   .
   # DMII - Managed with lifestyle modification at home. Has done well
   previously on sliding scale insulin without fixed dose regimen.
   - continue humalog SS ACHS
   .
   FEN:  heart healthy, diabetic diet, get tube feed recs.

   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with current supratherapeutic INR
   -Pain management not indicated
   -Bowel regimen with colace, senna, bisacodyl prn
