   Assessment and Plan
   59 y/o F with h/o mental retardation, recent dx of Nodular sclerosing
   Hodgkins Lymphoma s/p chemo on [**2897-8-2**] presented with acute respiratory
   distress likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging successfully
   extubated yesterday.
    # Initial Hypoxia: Likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging in the
   setting of depressed mental status, coughing and emesis. Maintained
   vent setting of [**4-8**] 40% FIO2 for over 24hs then successfully extubated.
   Continue with nebs and suctioning prn. Will benefit from continuous
   diuresis as appears to have anasarca and pulmonary edema secondary to
   aggressive fluid repletion during episodes of hypotension.
   - sedating meds d/c in the context of extubation
   - continue regular suction & albuterol nebs
   - continue to diurese pt with goal net negative 1-2L/day, 20mg IV lasix
   usually enough to achieve this goal
   # Fever: Will continue current antibiotics for now given positive
   sputum and septic picture. Currently afebrile with low white blood cell
   count.
   - sputum culture - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2897-8-9**]):
         >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
         1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   BUDDING YEAST WITH PSEUDOHYPHAE.
      RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2897-8-11**]):
         OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA ABSENT.
         YEAST.    SPARSE GROWTH.
         YEAST.    RARE GROWTH.  2ND TYPE.
      FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):
   - wound culture WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2897-8-10**]):    No significant
   growth.
   -blood culture from [**8-7**] no growth to date
   -urine culture no growth [**8-7**]
   # Hodgkins Lymphoma: Pt is s/p EACoPP protocol on [**2897-5-14**] with
   cytoxan, doxorubacin on day 1 and etoposide on days [**12-6**]. Pt has also
   had pericardial tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis on [**2897-4-17**] and
   pericardial window on [**2896-5-17**]. Pt initiated ICE chemo reg on
   [**2897-8-2**].  WBC trending down after chemotherapy. Ideally should be
   transfused for hct>30 to maintain oxygenation.
   - continue Acyclovir & Bactrim ppx
   - transfuse for  hct>30
   -f/u WBC and HCT
    # H/o megacolon/Diarrhea: Pt is s/p volvulous & sigmoid resection with
   large dilated loops of colon visible on portable films.  She has
   required intermittent rectal tubes, currently having alot of stool
   output with recent C. Diff toxin + [**2897-6-1**] & [**2897-6-25**].  Has not had
   issues with diarrhea for the last couple of days.
    - tube feeds per nutrition recs
   -  increase free water bolus as needed for hypernatremia, follow Na
    -continue po vanco & IV flagy
   - OG tube to intermittent suction
   # Paroxysmal A-fib: Recent adm to ICU due to poor rate control (rates
   of 160 with relative hypotension). decision to restart patient on low
   dose beta blocker this morning, already on amiodarone with what appears
   to be good rhythm contorl.
   -continue amiodarone
   -telemetry
   - beta blocker restarted this AM, however HR in the 50s so may not
   recieve
   - repeak EKG as needed
    # UA: Pt had positive UA on [**8-4**], Urine Cx + fungus 4000-6000 CFUs.
   Received fluconazole 400mg x 1
   - foley was changed out, UA from [**8-6**] was negative, urine culture
   negative, UA not likely source of infection.
    # F/E/N:
   -now extubated
   - replete lytes agressively
   - patient can get D5W via NG tube if extubated for hypernatremia
    # PPX: heparin SQ, PPI
   # CODE: Intubate/DNR
   # ACCESS: RIJ 3 lumen
