CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Change in mental status.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86-year-old
woman who was discharged earlier on the day of the 27th after
an 11 day stay for a fall with no loss of consciousness but a
rib fracture and a grade 3 splenic laceration. She was
discharged to a short term rehab and when she arrived there
she was noted to be febrile and minimally responsive with a
low O2 saturation.  At that point the rehab facility tried a
few different manipulations to increase the patient's oxygen
saturation unsuccessfully and she was sent to [**Hospital1 341**] for evaluation.  In the Emergency
Room chest x-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusion. These
were new.  There was no increased in splenic hematoma or
evidence of abscess on CT of the abdomen.  White blood cell
count was 20 on admission which was notably increased from
discharge.  On chest x-ray a retrocardiac opacity was found
and the patient was started on Levaquin for a presumptive
pneumonia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission vital signs, temperature
101.6, heart rate 92, blood pressure 122/46, respiratory rate
28, oxygen saturation 97% on five liters O2 nasal cannula.
The patient was lethargic but arousable.  Cardiac exam,
regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Pulmonary exam, she had decreased breath sounds at the left
lower lobe.  Abdominal exam was benign.  Extremities were
warm, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission, Zyprexa 7.5 mg po q d, Cardizem
120 mg po q d, KCL, Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg po q d, Ambien
5 mg po q h.s. prn, Motrin 200 mg po q d and Xalatan drops.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for depression,
hypertension, dementia, history of UTI, a rib fracture and a
recent grade 3 splenic laceration.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 19.5, hematocrit 32.1, platelet
count 552,000.  Differential on the white count, neutrophils
89, lymphs 5, monos 6.  SMA 7, sodium 132, potassium 5.7,
chloride 97, CO2 25, BUN 23, creatinine 0.7, glucose 193.
Repeat potassium was 3.6.  Urinalysis showed concentration
1.030, large blood, protein 100, nitrate positive, [**3-26**]
whites, [**3-26**] reds, 0-2 epis.  Chest x-ray was read as a left
lower lobe infiltrate with a small pleural effusion.  ABG,
7.50, 33, 90.  EKG showed no acute changes.

The plan on admission was to start the patient on Levaquin,
to obtain abdominal CT, rule out splenic abscess and then to
proceed with antibiotic treatment for either a UTI or
pneumonia.  The patient could have cultures drawn of blood,
urine and sputum and the antibiotics would be tailored
depending on those results.  The patient was initially
admitted to the trauma surgery service.  She was treated with
Levaquin and improved on hospital days #2 and 3 and on
hospital day #4, [**12-20**].  She was transferred to the medicine
service for further care.  At that time her clinical status
was improving.  Her oxygen requirement was down to 2 liters
nasal cannula with oxygen saturation of approximately 93%.
Exam was substantially unchanged from admission.  White count
had decreased to 13.6.  Hematocrit and platelet count were
stable.  SMA 7 was unremarkable.  The sputum sample was
consistent with contamination.  The CT of the abdomen
obtained on admission showed bilateral pleural effusions,
left greater than right, consolidation on the left, stable
complex splenic laceration with decreased perihepatic fluid.
On transfer to medicine the patient's treatment was continued
with Levaquin.  No other changes were made in her care.  On
hospital day #4, [**12-21**], the patient continued to improve, she
remained afebrile, her oxygen was discontinued and she satted
92-94% on room air.  Repeat LFTs were performed.  They all
decreased from admit and thus the concern for abdominal
processes was eased even more.  The urine culture grew out
less than 10,000 CFUs, therefore the only source of infection
left was the consolidation of the lungs.  Blood cultures grew
no growth to date.  The patient will likely be discharged on
[**2959-12-22**] to a short term rehab stay on a 14 day course of
Levaquin of which she has already completed four days.  The
patient is off oxygen.  Her mental status has returned to her
baseline and she has been afebrile for greater than 48 hours.
The patient is to be discharged on [**12-22**] to short term rehab
facility in stable condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Pneumonia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Levaquin 500 mg po q d as the only
change in her medicine compared with prior discharge
information.
