History of Present Illness:
This 80 year old female had a syncopal epsiode while driving and
was involved in an accident. Her work-up was remarkable for
paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and the finding of a
large thoracic aortic aneurysm.

She was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3953**] who peformed an echocardiogram
which showed the aorta to measure 6.9cm at the root, 6.3cm at
the arch to 4.1cm in the descending
thoracic aorta. There was [**1-31**]+ aortic insufficiency without
mention of the leaflet anatomy. Given the size of her thoracic
aortic aneurysm, she is referred for surgical evaluation.
Subsequently cardiac catheterization was done to reveal triple
vessel disease.  She was admitted for operation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Following same day admission she was taken to the Operating Room
where her operation was performed as noted.  See the operative
note for details.  She tolerated the procedure, weaning fom
bypass on Epinephrine and neosynephrine.  They were quickly able
to be weaned off and she was extubated the following morning.
CTs were removed on the first surgical day, beta blockers and
ACE inhibitors were resumed for control of her hypertension. She
continued to progress and was ready for floor transfer on POD 2.
Physical therapy worked with her for strength and mobility,
diuresis towards her preoperative weight was continued. Beta
blockade and ACE inhibitors were adjusted to provide adequate
blood pressure control.  She was evaluated for a rehabilitation
facility to allow further recovery prior to eventual return
home.  Pacing wires were removed on POD 3.  She was ready for
discharge to rehab on postoperative day four with continued
diuresis and zarolxyn for seven days.
