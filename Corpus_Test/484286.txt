Chief Complaint: STEMI
   24 Hour Events:
 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**3109-4-12**] 08:17 AM
   Akinetic region laterally with adjacent hypokinesis. Mild MR. LVEF
   40-45%.
 IABP LINE - STOP [**3109-4-12**] 03:18 PM
 SHEATH - STOP [**3109-4-12**] 03:20 PM
   - D/w EP who recommended stopping amiodarone and observing to see if
   there is further VT, ectopy - if so can always restart. They agree with
   low-dose beta-clocker. They ask that we consult EP before he leaves to
   tuck these issues in.
   - Echo shows lateral akinesis, LVEF 40-45%, 1+ MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 126**] need ACEi as BP
   can tolerate; did not start today as coming off IABP.
   - Prasugel given, Integrillin stopped, balloon removed, Plavix started.
   - [**Location (un) 4766**], [**Doctor Last Name 1895**], Mr and Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 14286**] discussed plan. Will go home
   soon for about a month prior to surgery.

   Imaging:
   Pnd CXR this a.m.
   Echo:
   The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
   left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild to moderate
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with lateral akinesis.
   No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
   ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
   arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There
   is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Microbiology: None.
   ECG: No events.
   ASSESSMENT
   This 52-year-old man with few other medical problems, mild hypertension
   and dyslipidemia, presents with his first symptomatic ischemic episdose
   with significant coronary disease involving all major vessels.
   PLAN
   CAD
   Enzymes trending down now. Integrillin stopped and will wait for
   endothelium in stent for CABG.
   - Plavix [**Hospital1 7**] 1 wk, then QD
   - ASA 325 EC
   - F/u with CSurg for CABG in one month
 make appointment
   - Find Cardiologist to follow him
   Heart Failure, systolic dysfunction
   Expect some recovery. Fluid balance still quite positive, 4.5 L since
   admission. Unlikely had this fluid deficit.
   - Allow to autodiurese - follow
   Arhythmia
 AF, VT, torsades
   Unlikely torsades now much less ectopy. AF and VT gone now
   - Continue metoprolol and convert to succinate on DC
   - EP consult prior to DC
   Anemia
   From 38 to 33 now. No clear place for bleeding, but sheath removed. No
   hematoma, back pain baseline, no change.
   Dispo
   To floor today, perhaps home tomorrow.
   Leukocytosis
   Resolved
 [**2-2**] stress response.
