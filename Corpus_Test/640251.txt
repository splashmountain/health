Chief Complaint: 85 year-old female with seizures, CHF (right sided),
   pulmonary HTN, atrial fib, rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR,
   severe TR, HTN, presents with fever, hypotension, seizures.  She has
   been at [**Hospital **] rehab recovering from a SBO surgery in the spring and
   has been slowly worsening.  She had a seizure 2 weeks ago and was
   started on Keppra.  Two days ago, her keppra dose was decreased for a
   high peak and somnalence.  On [**7-31**], she was febrile to 102.8.  She has
   had continued ventilator requirement.
   24 Hour Events:
   Per neuro keppra dc'd, currently on dilantin, level pending.
   EEG monitoring currently, per neuro, needs seizure free period >24
   hours before DC monitoring. After dc EEG, MRI to assess for
   anoxic/ischemic injury.
   Family specified no LP, broad spectrum anti-meningitis abx: acyclovir
   400mg/ampicillin 2g, Cefepime 2g.
   ROMI: Trops trending down (0.21, 0.24, 0.29), CK-MB 2, 4, not done.
   CXR, EKG: downsloping, 3mm STD in V4-V6, inf TWI, new from prior.
   Has DNR (not DNI) order.
   Cultures: Urine Cx, Urine legionella Ag -ve. Stool C.diff, sputum Cx, &
   Mrsa screen Pending.

   85 y/o female with hx R-sided heart failure, pulmonary HTN, afib,
   rheumatic heart disease s/p MVR c mechanical valve, HTN, who presents
   with fever, hypotension, unresponsiveness.
   Plan:
   Sepsis: Continues to have low grade fevers to 99.6, mild leukocytosis
   to 10.1. Pseudomonas sputum initially thought culprit ,but grew oral
   flora. UCx still pending. Cipro flagyl dc
d. Empiric treatment
   meningitis. Day 5 acyclovir, ampicillin, vancomycin.
   f/u culture results.
   If repeat head CT allows, LP today.
   Seizure: EEG dc
d following seizure free period > 24 hours. No seizures
   observed since. Continue dilantin goal range 15-20, ativan for
   breakthrough seizure.
   Head CT today prior to LP ,  ? inc ICP.
   Coagulopathy:
   INR 7.2. Coumadin, sub Q heparin held. Pt got vit K with repeat INR
   pending this am. Requires reversal for LP.
   Chronic respiratory failure: respiratory alkalosis, with good
   oxygenation. Currently stable. No ABG checks.
   Afib: holding anticoagulation. On metroprolol [**Hospital1 **].
   Pressure ulcers: f/u  wound care recs.
   Acute renal failure: likely pre
renal in setting sepsis. IVF to uop
   >30cc/hr, MAPs >60.
   Hypernatremia. D5 if need to correct, LRS for resuscitation.
   Diabetes: ISS at home. Continue.
   Anemia. Base;line crit 25-29 currently 25.2 daily crits.
   Mechanical valve: holding coumadin.
   LFT abnormalities: perhaps secondary to hypoperfusion = mild. Trend.
