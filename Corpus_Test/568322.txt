   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo female with h/o HTN now with acute onset of abdominal pain
   consistent with past admissions and associated HTN in the setting of
   medication non-compliance in the setting of nausea.  She has an absence
   of end organ damage at this time and has had reasonable response to
   medication Rx to date.  The acute onset, absence of LVH and rapid
   resolution with TNG alone does raise the question of possible acute
   ingestion with adrenergic agonist, although this is unlikely it has not
   been investigated in past.
   1)Hypertension-
   -Wean TNG gtt to off
   -Return to po medications
   -Will check tox screen for possible cocaine
   -Good response to date
   2)Nausea/Abdominal Pain/Vomiting-
   -Will continue with Zofran
   -Possible abdominal migraine
   -Will discuss trial of NSAIDS with GI
   3)Schizophrenia-
   -Continue with monitoring
