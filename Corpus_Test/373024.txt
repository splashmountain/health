   Assessment and Plan
   58 F with history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS, CKD, resolved respiratory
   failure, with ascities and abdominal compartment syndrome s/p
   paracentesis with SBP on vanco, [**Last Name (un) 411**], caspofungin. Patient was
   initially admitted from OSH with encephalopathy and hepatorenal
   syndrome requiring dialysis, s/p respiratory failure (extubated [**3-29**])
   and s/p paracentesis complicated by intraabdominal bleed, awaiting
   liver/kidney transplant, desated to day in the setting of
   unresponsiveness.
   .
   # Hemodynamics/hypotension
 likely chronically hypotensive in setting
   of liver disease with a high cardiac output.  Has art line, will
   continue to monitor.  Continue fluids with boluses as needed and
   albumin.
   - will tolerate MAPs >60
   - albumin day [**4-17**]
   - trend lactates as sign of end organ damage
   - on levophed
   .
   # Leukocytosis
 worsening, on vanco, [**Last Name (un) 411**], caspofungin (since [**4-6**]).
   Yeast identified in urine, sputum and skin/ascites SBP, other etiology
   is L abdominal eschar could be infected. Patient had diagnostic and
   therapeutic tap on [**4-11**] where 4L removed. SBP diagnosis was made, after
   correcting for RBCs, however gram stain negative.
   - ID following, sent b-glucan, galactomannin on [**4-12**]
   - for skin infection, getting surgery and derm c/s [**4-12**]
   - continue vanco, [**Last Name (un) 411**], caspofungin
 follow up with renal dosing of
   meds, after CVVH will change to 500mg IV Q24H
   .
   # AMS/unresponsiveness:
   --> Finding: In the ICU responds to voice but clearly somnolent, no
   focal deficit, although difficult to assess
   --> data: liver failure, renal failure, CNS active meds, minimal
   electrolyte abnormalitries, infection, normal glucose
   --> differential: most likely hepatic encephalopathy, worsend by ?
   ongoing infection, electrolye, renal failure, other DD include seizure,
   IC bleed, IC infection
   --> continue lactulose, increasing dose today to 60 mg qid to see if
   she wakes up
   --> q4 neuro checks
   .
   # Hepatorenal syndrome/Abdominal Compartment Syndrome - likely
   triggered by 11 L Para on [**3-14**] with only 25gm albumin. Patient is
   currently oliguric.  Renal has been following.  Has been getting
   intermittent HD.  UO has basically been 0 since transfer to ICU.
   Previously, patient was listed for a kidney transplant. Renal function
   is worse in the setting of Abdominal Compartment Syndrome. On [**4-11**], had
   tap to reduce pressures
   - since blood pressures unstable, renal will do CVVH.
   - f/u renal recs
   - cont albumin, octreotide, midodrine for now
   # Hoarse Voice: Pt reports that voice became hoarse following
   self-extubation. Possible that she endured vocal [**Last Name (un) 8082**] trauma.
   - will ENT consult
   .
   # HCV cirrhosis - decompensated w/ varices, massive ascites s/p tips,
   encephalopathy. Hepatology does not feel that she is transplant
   candidate, too unstable.
   - liver team following
   .
   # DM2
 lantus 32u daily for hyperglycemia, and HISS, starting insulin
   drip since renal failure.
   # Seizure disorder -  tegretol levels can be altered in hepatic/renal
   failure and altered albumin levels
   -back on home tegretol, checking levels [**4-12**]
   .
   # Depression/Anxiety. - holding psych meds due to delta MS.
   .
   # PPx:  pneumoboots, PPI
   .
   # FEN: TF at goal 40 cc/hr
   # Access RIJ replaced [**4-11**], HD line; 2 [**Last Name (LF) 3418**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] line
