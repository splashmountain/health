   - no PICC yesterday b/c of fever within 24 hrs

   Assessment and Plan
   89F w chronic diastolic heart failure (EF 70% on echo in [**11/2597**]) with
   several recent admissions for CHF, severe MR, CAD (MI in [**2570**]), HTN,
   dyslipidemia who presented from [**Hospital3 1115**] with shortness of breath
   likely [**2-26**] acute CHF exacerbation from PNA and UTI, transferred to CCU
   for hypotension requiring phenylephrine.
   .
   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: Sx, exam, labs, imaging
   suggest exacerbation of her diastolic heart failure. Respiration
   improved with diuresis.
   - continue carvedilol
   - continue furosemide 40mg PO daily
   - monitor creatinine
   - monitor I/O closely
   - wean off supplemental oxygen
   - recheck BNP upon discharge
   # PNA: 02 sats improved. Unable to get sputum cultures, will continue
   for 10 day antibiotic course on vanco and pip-tazo; afebrile.
   - continue pip-tazo and vanco
   - suplemental O2 as needed
   - speech and swallow eval if continues to have difficulty swallowing
   -
   # UTI: pyuria, unable to obtain sx; Urine Cx
 E. coli (pan-sensitive)
   - continue pip-tazo (for pna as well)
   .
   # Distended abdomen: dilated bowel loops on AXR, no sxs of free air.
   Concerning for partial impaction.
   - serial abd exams
   - serial AXRs
   - more aggressive bowel regimen
   .
   # CORONARIES:  history of MI in [**2570**]. No sign of active ischemia
   currently.
   - continue home aspirin, statin
   .
   # RHYTHM:  v-paced, s/p pacer for 3rd-degree AV block in [**2584**].
   - telemetry
   .
   # History of hypertension: Hypotensive on admission likely [**2-26**] sepsis,
   in light of infections (PNA/UTI). S/p phenylephrine drip. No need for
   pressors at this time.
   - fluid bolus if needed, but caution [**2-26**] CHF
   - on carvedilol
   - will restart lisinopril once BP more stable
   .
   # Dyslipidemia: hypercholesterolemia in [**2594**].
   - continue statin
   .
   FEN:  thickened liquids, aspiration precautions
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with hep SC
   CODE: DNR/DNI
   DISPO: CCU care for now
