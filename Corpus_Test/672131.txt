   Assessment and Plan
   77M NH resident with copd, L hemid elevation  with prior LL lobectomy,
   chronic aspiration, Parkinson
s ds presents with
         Fever,
         Resp failure requiring NPPV
         Hypoxemia (probable asp and copd flare)
         Tachycardia
         Transient hypotension
         Elevated CEs, probable demand ischemia (now resolved)
         hyperK (resolved)
   Suspect aspiration pna/pneumonitis and copd exacerbation are the
   primary issues leading to this presentation in a pt with significant
   underlying lung ds with copd and probable restrictive pulmonary
   physiology from kyphosis.  He does not seem to have significant lower
   tract secretions but rather oral secretions are difficult to manage.
   We have been unable to obtain adequate sputum sample and he is too
   tenuous for bronchoscopy.
    Agree with plan to treat for asp pna and copd exacerbation.  Now day 2
   empiric broad antibx for NH acquired pna/asp and possible UTI  w/
   vanco,cefe, tailoring per cx data.  Now with
 GPC clusters from blood
   (? Contaminant).  Continue steroids, and nebs.  He has tolerated NPPV
   well, able to take breaks intermittently, but remains tenuous from resp
   standpoint  and he does not appear to have a quickly reversible pulm
   process and may require intubation, with aggressive pulm toilet.. Would
   repeat CXR and abg at this time, and obtain CT chest to better assess
   lung parenchyma once intubated or more stable from resp standpoint.
   Tachycardia has improved and suspect was related to resp distress.
   Hypotension resolved after minimal IVFs. Keep NPO (g tube) for now for
   possible intubation. ,CU: PIvs, PPI, sq hep.
