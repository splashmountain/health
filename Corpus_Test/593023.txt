   Chief Complaint: transfer for BiV Pacer placement
   HPI:
   49 y/o M w/ h/o dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 15-20%,
   chronic atrial fibrillation who was undergoing placement of BiV
   pacer/ICD at [**Hospital6 **].  Were able to place RA/RV leads, but
   procedure was complicated by unsuccessful cannulation of coronary
   sinus, and development of acute dyspnea thought to be pulmonary edema.
   Patient was given nitro gtt, cefazolin 2grams, lasix 80mg IV lasix in
   cath lab, amiodarone 400, cozaar 25, coreg 6.25 given at OSH.  Zofran
   4mg IVx1.  Was on 2L NC prior to transfer.
   .
   On arrival to [**Hospital1 1**], patient was stable and without chest pain or
   shortness of breath on 2L NC.  Generally patient describes being
   symptomatic in his atrial fibrillation.  He was able to go for a 14
   mile bike ride this past week, however.
   .
   At baseline, patient reports 2 pillow orthopnea, no LE edema, recent
   weight gain, PND, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
   .
   On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep
   venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
   myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
   He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock
   or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**3215-5-20**] demonstrated:
   1.  LV: EF of 20-25%, there was severe hypokinesis of the anterior,
   basal-mid anteroseptal, basal-mid anterolateral and apical walls.
   Severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5577**] of flow in portal vein.  Moderate TR.  Low
   normal systolic function of the RV.  Estimated PA systolic BP of
   35mmHg.

   CXR on arrival: Dual chamber lead placement, no PTX, no e/o significant
   volume overload, enlarged cardiac silhouette.
   Microbiology: n/a
   ECG: EKG [**11-29**] demonstrated: Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats
   and first degree A-V block. Left bundle-branch block. Compared to the
   previous tracing of [**3214-9-5**] atrial fibrillation is absent and sinus
   rhythm is now present and atrial premature beats are new.
   .
   EKG: atrial fibrillation with LBBB.  ST segments c/w hyperkalemia,
   metabolic disturbances.  Precordial leads with ST Segments > 5mm.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 49 y/o M w/ h/o Dilated Cardiomyopathy, dual chamber pacer
   who is transferred for mgmt of pulmonary edema and BiV pacer upgrade.
   .
   #. Dilated Cardiomyopathy (Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure): EF
   20%.  Planned for upgrade to BiV pacer/ICD tomorrow in OR.  Cardiac
   surgery available if unable to place coronary sinus lead for epicardial
   lead.  NPO aftermidnight.  Evidence of mild volume overload on exam.
   - check labs on arrival
   - follow UOP overnight, goal negative 0.5L
   - continue carvedilol, losartan
   - Cardiac Surgery aware
   .
   #. Afib: INR therapeutic, hold coumadin in preparation for OR in AM.
   - heparin gtt PRN prior to lab
   - aspirin, digoxin, amiodarone
   - BiV pacer placement in AM.
   .
   #. Sleep Apnea:
   - monitor O2 sats overnight.
   .
   #. FEN: Replete lytes prn, cardiac diet, NPO after 12am
