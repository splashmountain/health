Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - IABP pulled
   - Extubated
   - Started captopril and uptitrated for afterload reduction
   - Pm Hct stable
   - PM lytes with K 3.6 so repleted then with more lasix for extubation
   had K 3.3 so received more K
   - Temp 100.1 and sputum with 3+ GPCs and strep pneumo from OSH cultures
   so started vanc/zosyn
   - Got 20mg lasix IV X1 prior to extubation for frothy secretions
   although UOP good after the first dose in the am
   - Restarted hep gtt at 4pm for apical AK on TTE (will need transition
   to coumadin prior to discharge)
   - Started coreg as HRs in 90s and BPs 150s/80s
   - Delirious overnight and suspect ICU psychosis. Zyprexa given and did
   not respond so got haldol.
   - Flashed at 2am with BPs 180s/120s, tachypnea to 30s, and HR 120s with
   tiny drop in sats responded to nitro gtt, morphine (2mg), and
   non-invasive mask ventilation. Got 40mg IV lasix with only 20ml out so
   got 80mg as CXR looked like more pulm edema (although poor film) -> put
   out 2L (from [**3-15**] AM). EKG with inferior ST depressions and little
   longer QT with continued STE V1-V3 as in prior.

   Assessment and Plan
   49 y/o F w/ CAD s/p CABG, prior VF arrest p/w unrevascularized anterior
   STEMI and cardiogenic shock s/p removal of IABP and extubation [**6-1**].
   .
   #Cardiogenic Shock
 resolved, hemodynamically stable s/p extubation
   and IABP removal
   - cont captopril and carvedilol for afterload reduction (change hold
   parameters to SBP 90)
   - heparin gtt for IABP being held currently for pulling IABP and will
   restart after for apical AK on TTE as bridge to coumadin
   - TTE showed WMA consistent with large anterior MI, anterior septum and
   free wall hypokinetic/ akinetic, and EF depressed to 40-50%, question
   if ICD line is causing worsening TR. Will need coumadin prior to d/c
   for apical AK.
   .
   #. CAD: Severe multivessel disease, now s/p anterior wall STEMI,
   several days old, likely secondary to SSVG to LAD occlusion based on
   OSH cath images on review.   Mid LAD is occluded and there is a
   proximal LAD stenosis that supplies a moderate size diagonal, that on
   cath film appears to supply a viable, contracting territory.  Her SVG
   to OM has in stent restenosis.  Her SVG to PDA is patent.
   - Unlikely repeat PCI would provide benefit at this time
   - Will eventually need viability study prior to discharge
   - continue aspirin 325, plavix 75mg, lipitor 80, heparin gtt (stopped
   at 3am in prep for IABP pulling), start captopril today and consider
   coreg later if BPs ok after captopril
   - check A1c
   - transfuse to HCT>30 (s/p transfusion of 2 units of PRBCs). Will check
   hct later today to ensure stable
   .
   #. Respiratory failure:  Secondary to cardiogenic shock, extubated.
   Flashed yesterday and responded well to lasix bolus with improvement in
   clinical parameters
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - no need for lasix currently, monitor UOP to keep negative 1L
   .
   # Transaminitis: Presumably ischemic, trend enzymes and consider
   further w/u PRN
   .
   # Pneumonia
 low grade temp O/N, sputum gram stain w/ GPC
   pairs/clusters but Cx mod growth OP flora; has been on vent for
   extended period however. Unlikely MRSA pneumonia. Not hospital
   acquired. Has defervesced and improved clinically. Currently on
   Vanc/Zosyn day #2, day #4 of antibiotics.
   - discontinue vanc and zosyn for now
   - start levofloxacin 750mg x 5 days
   .
   #. Normocytic Anemia
 presumed [**3-10**] IABP placement, hapto wnl, s/p 2 U
   PRBC
   -maintain Hct > 30
   .
   #. Access: will need to d/c OSH lines today and place PICC
   #. PPx:  heparin gtt, bowel regimen prn
   #. Emergency contact:

   Chart reviewed.  Patient interviewed and examined.  I agree with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 7048**]
s H+P, A+P.  IABP successfully weaned and patient extubated.
   We plan supportive care with ischemia, viability study when she is
   stronger to assess need for revascularization.  60 minutes spent on
   patient critical care.  ICU level care due to cardiogenic shock, recent
   intubation, compromised respiratory status.
