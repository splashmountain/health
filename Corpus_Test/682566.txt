   Assessment and Plan
   56 y/o M PMH diabetes, HTN, hyperlipidemia who presents with altered
   mental status and hypoxia
   .
   # Altered mental status: Improved, now off sedation. Oriented x 3.
   - F/u neuro recs
   - F/u cultures
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Extubated, breathing comfortably. Sputum gram
   stain with GPC's but sparse commensal respiratory flora on preliminary
   culture. On ceftriaxone/azithromycin/vancomycin (started [**3-17**])
   - F/u final sputum culture
   - C/w vanco/azithromycin, given sputum findings
   - ID approval for vancomycin beyond today
   - Consider d/c ceftriaxone, as vancomycin covering gram positives
   .
   # Wide complex tachycardia: Single run of eight beats, has not
   recurred. Written for home beta blocker
   - C/w telemetry. metoprolol
   .
   # Hypertension: moderate control overnight. Now on home
   anti-hypertensives (HCTZ, lisinopril, metoprolol) and receiving
   lasix/hydral boluses
   - Monitor
   .
   # Asthma: C/w NEBs
   .
   # Diabetes: sliding scale
   .
   # Anemia: Stabilized after mild hct drop. No transfusions required
   - Trend
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Home atorvastatin (80 mg QHS) held given elevated
   LFTs on admission. No lipid panel on record
   - Recheck LFTs, restart statin if normal
   .
   # GERD: Convert omeprazole to IV pantoprazole.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, HH/DM diet
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, SQ heparin at 7500 mg Q8
   # Access: PIV 22g x1, right radial; L PICC. Consider d/c radial line as
   patient extubated, BP stable
   # Communication: Patient, Wife ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 13352**])
   # Code:  Full (discussed with HCP)
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Mr. [**Known patient lastname 5393**] with the ICU team; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12940**]
s note from
   today reflects my input.  I would add/emphasize that he did well after
   extubation, with some hypertension requiring IV TNG (now off).  Today,
   seen while up on commode and eating breakfast.  Breathing comfortably;
   says he is still somewhat labored with exertion.  Meds, labs, and
   imaging all reviewed.
   Assessment and Plan
   56-year-old man transferred from OSH for altered mental status and
   respiratory failure.  Both have resolved.
   AMS: Unclear etiology.  Suspect this was hypercarbia/OSA, with
   cannabinoids on board, also takes oxycodone at home.  Now resolved.
   Agree with neuro that this appears to be toxic/metabolic and has
   resolved.
   Respiratory failure: Resolved
   treat empirically for CAP.  Vanco given GPCs on sputum g/s.
   CPAP for OSA whenever sleeping
   Asthma hx: No evidence of acute flare
   Mild transaminitis: Unclear etiology.
 Hold statin.  NASH possible.  Will need follow up.
   HTN
 adding back home meds
   GERD
 continue home PPI
   DM
 RISS, goal BS<150
   Other issues as per ICU team note from today
   To floor.
