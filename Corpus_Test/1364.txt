History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8192**] is a 76 year-old gentleman with history of CAD s/p
CABG [**2517**], PVD, HTN, COPD, U/L RAS and asthma who had presented
to the ED with 2 days of productive cough and SOB. In the ED he
was febrile to 103.8, RR 22, O2 sat was 85% on RA which improved
to 98 % on 100% NRB. With NRB, ABG was 7.47/33/195. Given
tachypnea and general appearance, patient was started on CPAP
which provided symptomatic relief. CXR was done in ED with
showed evidence of CHF +/-PNA. He was treated with combivent
nebs x2, ceftriaxone 1 g x1, azithromycin 250 mg x 1, lasix 40
mg IV x 2, levaquin 500 mg IV x1, vancomycin I g x 1, morphine 4
mg x 1, ASA supp 600 mg x1, tylenol 1300 mg PR x1, and nitro
paste 1 inch.
.
In the MICU, patient was breathing more comfortably and reported
interval improvement in his symptoms. COPD flare/PNA/CHF were
treated with Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin, Lasix 80 mg IV x 1 and
supportive nebulizers. By the morning, he was weaned down to 2L
nasal cannula.
.
Of note, patient has undergone a right TPT/PT lesion with
atherectomy on [**2526-6-19**] complicated by groin hematoma with
extension into penis and scrotum. U/S did not reveal fistula or
pseudoaneursym.
.
On transfer to the floor, patient reported that his breathing
status was better, still felt short of breath but nowhere near
when he had come in last night. Had eaten full meal, denied
abdominal or urinary complaints. Reported that his lower
extremity edema was better, but still persisted.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 76 year-old gentleman with PMHx CAD s/p CABG, PVD,
HTN, COPD/Asthma who presented with PNA/CHF exacerbation/COPD
flare. The following issues were addressed during hospital
admission.
.
# Cough/SOB/fever/leukocytosis
Given tachypnea and oxygen desturation on room air, patient was
admitted to the medical ICU for overnight monitoring. He did
well on a non-rebreather and BIPAP overnight, and was quickly
transitioned to nasal cannula once his underlying respiratory
issues were addressed. Dyspnea was thought to be secondary PNA,
COPD flare, and CHF exacerbation, the latter two precipitated by
infection. Patient was treated for community acquired PNA with
10 days of antibiotics; for CHF exacerbation, patient was placed
on low sodium diet, diuresed with Lasix; and for COPD flare,
patient was treated with short course of steroids and adjuncitve
nebulizers/inhaled steroids. He was weaned off of oxygen with an
oxygen saturation of 94-97% on room air. After treatment,
patient remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable throughout
his hospital stay. Patient exhibited leukocytosis on discharge,
and this was attributed to steroids administration. CBC should
be checked in [**1-4**] days to ensure it does not continue to rise.
Patient was afebrile without any new localizing sources of
infection. On discharge, a chest CT ordered to f/u a ground
glass appearance on CXR showed multiple areas of consolidation
and emphysema. Aspiration cannot be ruled out. Pt. will need
outpatient speech and swallow study.
.
# ARF: Baseline 1.1
On admission, patient's creatinine was 2.1. This was thought to
be due to both dehydration and ? post-obstructive component from
groin hematoma (patient with history of peripheral
cath/intervention). Foley was placed by urology and creatinine
improved to 1.3 on discharge. Creatinine should be checked in
[**1-4**] days to ensure it continues to normalize. Medications were
renally dosed and NSAIDS were avoided.
.
# Groin hematoma
Patient with known groin hematoma following recent peripheral
revascularization procedure. Ultrasound was done which was not
concerning for pseudoaneurysm or fistula. Continued to improve
by exam.
.
# Anemia
Patient guiaic positive on exam. Hct remained stable during
hospital stay. On colonoscopy in [**2521**], adenomatous polyps were
found and repeat colonoscopy was recommended in 3 years, for
which patient is overdue. Outpatient PCP was notified that a
colonoscopy needs to be scheduled in the near future and pt.
will f/u with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2526-7-8**] . Iron was low; transferrin and
saturation were not checked in acute setting of pulmonary
process, but should be re-checked and managed accordingly (i.e.
iron supplementation, f/u colonoscopy) as outpatient.
.
# CARDIAC
No chest pain/angina issues. EKG without changes, paced rhythm.
Trop of 0.34 in the setting of creatinine of 2.1 - per cards
curbside in ED, most likely [**1-3**] demand ischemia and ARF. Patient
was continued on ASA, statin, plavix. Patient was not on BB due
to underlying COPD/Asthma. Outpatient [**Last Name (un) **] (Candesartan) was
restarted at 4 mg and titrated up to 16 mg with good effect.
.
# HTN: BP well controlled on Diltiazem and Candesartan.
.
# PVD
Continued ASA, plavix
.
# Hypothyroidism
Continued Levothyroxine 50 mcg Po QD. TSH was elevated at 4.9,
FT4 was within norml limits. Should be re-checked once acute
issues resolve.
.
# FEN:
Electrolytes were repleted as necessary. He was maintained on
low salt, cardiac healthy diet, with fluid restriction to 1.5
liters
