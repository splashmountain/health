Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4536**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2806-11-20**]: heart catheterization with three bare metal stents
placed in the proximal and distal RCA for 50-60% diffuse disease
in the proximal-mid artery and total occlusion in the distal
artery, and one bare metal stent placed in the PDA for 90%
stenosis

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 79 yo F w/ PMH CAD s/p MI w/ 2 stents and angioplasty in
[**2796**], DMII (last HbA1C 7.2 in [**2-12**]), dyslipidemia, and CVA [**2803**]
p/w chest pain that began in the middle of last week. The pt
reports that her pain began in the middle of the night last
Wednesday or Thursday. It woke her up at 2am and she felt pain
in her left arm and left chest. This pain lasted all night
though the pt tried to apply hot pads, ice packs and take advil,
it did not take the pain away very long. She denies nausea or
shortness of breath associated with the episode but does denote
chills. She remembers feeling pain like this in the past, when
she had her last MI [**05**] years ago. This pain continued
intermittently through the weekend and actually felt better
today, so much so that she was almost not going to call her
doctor. She was sent from her doctor's office to the ED due to
STE on EKG.
.
In the ED, initial VS were T 99.1, P 70-80, BP 104-148/41-93), R
18, O2 98 RA. By the time she arrived she had no cp/sob, and
stated 0/10 pain, but had L arm pain yesterday. She was given
ASA 325mg and started on a heparin gtt. She was shortly taken to
the cath lab.
.
In the Cath Lab, the LAD showed diffuse ISR with serial 70-80%
lesions including ostium of LAD. Diagonal had 50-60% diffuse
disease. The LCX showed mild luminal irregularities with OM1
upper pole 50% and lower pole 40%. The RCA proximal and mid
diffuse 50-60%, distal total occlusion with collaterals from LCA
filling PL but not PDA. PTCA was performed with a 2.0 mm balloon
in the distal RCA. A 2.25 x 28 mm Minivision BMS was placed in
the distal RCA. A more proximal overlapping 2.25 x 8 mm
Minivision stent was deployed in what appeared to be a filling
defect.  A more proximal nonoverlapping 2.5 x 28 mm Minivision
stent repaired the mid vessel lesion.  The mid portion was
postdilated with a 3.0 mm balloon in a focal area of
underexpansion.  A 90% origin PDA was repaired with a 2.25 x 8
mm Integriti stent placed in a distal overlapping fashion with
the first stent.  Final angiography revealed normal flow, no
dissection and 0% residual stenosis in the stents. There was
residual 40% stenosis in the proximal RCA.
.
In the CCU, the pt was resting comfortably in bed, with no
complaints of chest pain, sob, abd pain, or nausea.

Past Medical History:
CAD s/p MI with 2 stents and angioplasty [**2796**] (cardiac cath
showed single vessel disease with stenting to the LAD
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of diagonal. LAD

Cardiac catheterization [**2806-11-20**]:
PTCA was performedwith a 2.0 mm balloon in the distal RCA and
proximal PDA withrestoration of flow, but flow degraded over 10
minutes ofobservation.  The decision was made to definitively
repair theRCA.  A 2.25 x 28 mm Minivision BMS was placed in the
distal RCA.A more proximal overlapping 2.25 x 8 mm Minivision
stent was deployed in what appeared to be a filling defect.  A
moreproximal nonoverlapping 2.5 x 28 mm Minivision stent
repaired themid vessel lesion.  The mid portion was postdilated
with a 3.0 mmballoon in a focal area of underexpansion.  A 90%
origin PDA was repaired with a 2.25 x 8 mm Integriti stent
placed in a distal overlapping fashion with the first stent.
Final angiography revealed normal flow, no dissection and 0%
residual stenosis in the stents.   There was residual 40%
stenosis in the proximal RCA.
.
TTE [**2806-11-21**]:
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-5**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic valve stenosis.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2803-3-18**],
the findings are similar (PA systolic pressure could not be
quantified on the current study).
.
Chest x-ray [**2806-11-21**]:
AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
sitting semi-upright position. The heart is moderately enlarged.
The configuration suggests a relative prominence of the left
ventricle, but there is no conclusive evidence for left atrial
enlargement. The thoracic aorta is
generally widened and elongated, but no local contour
abnormality or
significant wall calcification is identified. The pulmonary
vasculature is
not congested. No signs of acute infiltrates are present and the
lateral
pleural sinuses are free. No pneumothorax is seen in the apical
area.
Our records include a previous chest examination dated [**10-7**], [**2796**].
Remarkable is that the findings are very similar in as much the
patient already at that time had cardiomegaly with left
ventricular prominence, but absence of conclusive pulmonary
congestion. The patient underwent a chest CT on [**2805-2-14**]. This study is also reviewed and confirms the
observations made on the plain portable chest x-ray. In
addition, moderate
degree of aortic valve as well as coronary arterial
calcifications were
identified and a mildly widened and elongated thoracic aorta was
noted. The left lower lobe pulmonary condyloma was examined and
was found to be innocent.
IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate cardiac enlargement mostly
involving left
ventricle. No signs of acute congestion or infiltrate on
portable chest
examination.
.
[**2806-11-23**] Carotid Series Complete: There is a mild intimal
thickening and heterogeneous  bilaterally along the common
carotid and proximal internal carotid arteries. The peak
systolic velocity in the right internal carotid artery ranges
from 45-101 cm/sec and on the left internal carotid artery
ranges from 63-87 cm/sec. The peak systolic velocity in the
right common carotid artery is 74 cm/sec and left common carotid
artery is 56 cm/sec. Bilateral external carotid arteries are
patent. There is antegrade flow in the bilateral vertebral
arteries. The ICA/CCA ratio on the right is 1.4 and 1.6 on the
left.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo F w/ PMH CAD s/p MI w/ 2 stents and angioplasty in [**2796**],
DMII (last HbA1C 7.2 in [**2-12**]), dyslipidemia, and CVA [**2803**] p/w
chest pain, found to have an inferior STEMI, treated with three
bare metal stents in the RCA and one in the PDA, with hospital
course complicated by post-intervention atrial
fibrillation/flutter.
.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# CAD: Pt has hx of MI in [**2796**] w/ stent placement, found to have
STE on EKG and taken to the cath lab and is now s/p 4 stent
placement, 3 in RCA, 1 in PDA with possible plans for a CABG in
one month. She was put on ASA 325mg daily, and continued on her
home clopidogrel 75mg daily that she will need to take for at
least one month, but to be stopped 5 days prior to her CABG. She
was continued on her home lopressor and was switched from her
home simvastatin to rosuvastatin due to complaints of muscle
cramps on simvastatin. Her home olmesartan was held due to low
blood pressures, and then re-started at half her home dose as
her blood pressure tolerated it. Cardiac surgery saw the patient
for possible CABG and her pre-op work-up began with carotid
ultrasound, which showed no evidence of significant carotid
artery stenosis bilaterally, but did show mild intimal
thickening and heterogeneous plaque along the common carotid and
proximal internal carotid arteries.
.
# Atrial fibrillation/flutter: One day post-intervention, the
patient was noted to have irregular rhythm, alternating between
coarse atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.  She was
subsequently anticoagulated with warfarin 5mg daily, and was
bridged with lovenox injections.  Her rate was controlled with
metoprolol 25mg TID. On the day prior to discharge, she was
successfully cardioverted into normal sinus rhythm with
occasional PACs. She will be discharged on pradaxa.
.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Hypertension: Documented history of this problem, for which
the patient had been treated with metoprolol 50 mg TID,
amlodipine 10 mg daily and olmesartan 40mg daily prior to
admission.  She was hypotensive after her intervention, so her
medications were initially held and she was restarted on her
home metoprolol. Her amlodipine was discontinued due to her
being post-myocardial infarction.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Documented history of this problem, for which
the patient had self-discontinued treatment with simvastatin
secondary to intolerable leg cramping.  Following her
intervention, the patient was started on rosuvastatin, which she
tolerated well.  During this admission, her lipid panel
demonstrated uncontrolled lipids with total cholesterol 217,
triglycerides 210, HDL 56, chol/HDL 3.9 and LDL 119.
.
# Diabetes: Last HbA1C prior to this admission was 7.2% in [**2804**].
 During this admission, the patient's HbA1c was 7.5%, indicative
of ongoing poorly-controlled diabetes.  While an inpatient, the
patient was treated with a sliding scale of insulin.  She was
also counseled regarding the importance of diet and exercise
modifications.  Her PCP may consider initiation of treatment
with metformin.
.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
1.) Recommend initiation of treatment for poorly-controlled
diabetes with metformin, though pt will need further teaching
into importance of medications.

Dyslipidemia
History of stroke


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
You had chest pain and a heart attack. You were brought to the
catheterization lab at [**Hospital1 4**] and blockages were found in your
right coronary artery and posterior descending artery. These
blockages were fixed with 4 bare metal stents. You will need to
take aspirin 325 mg and Plavix 75 mg every day for the next
month without fail to keep these stents open. Do not stop taking
aspirin and plavix for any reason unless Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] tells you it
is OK. You also had an irregular heart rhythm called atrial
fibrillation that was converted to a regular rhythm after an
electrical cardioversion. Your heart may revert back to atrial
fibrillation over the next month so we want you to use an event
monitor to check your rhythm. Atrial fibrillation makes a stroke
more likely so you will be started on Pradaxa for the next month
to prevent a stroke. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will let you know if you need to
continue this medicine after a month. This medicine makes it
more likely for you to have minor bleeding such as a nosebleed
or bleeding gums, this is normal. A major bleeding event would
be dark or bloody stools, fatigue and trouble breathing. Please
call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] right away if you notice this. Your other
medicines have been adjusted as noted below. Your blood sugars
have been high, please follow the high fiber, low carbohydrate
diet that we discussed and talk to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] about starting
medicines to lower your blood sugars.
.
1. STOP taking amlodipine
2. Decrease benicar to 20 mg daily ([**2-5**] of a pill)
3. Continue to take plavix every day for one month at least
along with aspirin 325 mg to prevent the stents from clotting
off
4. START Pradaza (dabigatran) to prevent a blood clot if your
atrial fibrillation returns.
5. START Crestor (rosuvastatin) to lower your cholesterol.
6. Take acetaminophen (tylenol) instead of advil for any pain
7. Take nitroglyerin if you have shest pain that is similar to
the chest pain you had before your heart attack. Call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
if you have any chest pain.
