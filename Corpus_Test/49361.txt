HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10335**] is a 70 year old
male originally from the [**Location (un) 7394**] who was found to have
enhancing lower pole lesion in the left kidney that was
approximately 2.3 cm by 2.5 cm in diameter.  It was exophytic
as seen on computerized tomography scan of the abdomen and
pelvis.  Of note is that on the prior computerized tomography
scan performed in [**2645-2-7**], the mass was also present
but measured 1.7 cm and looked like a hemorrhagic cyst.
However, it has grown since then.  In addition the patient
was noted to have evidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm
measuring 4.5 by 3.7 cm at the level of the left renal vein
which was being followed by Vascular Surgery.  Different
options were discussed with the patient and the decision was
made to proceed with surgical intervention.  The patient was
cleared by Vascular Surgery to proceed with nephrectomy.
Also his last prostate specific antigen was 1 in [**2645-3-7**].
On review of systems the patient notes nocturia approximately
two to three times every two to three hours.  He also has a
history of transurethral resection of the prostate, as well
as a history of bladder stones and lithotripsy performed in
[**2645-3-7**].  He also has a history of neck pain and back
pain.  The rest of the review of systems was not remarkable.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a history of smoking, no
history of alcohol abuse.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unremarkable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Alert and oriented in no apparent
distress.  Temperature is 98, blood pressure 147/52,
heartrate 81, respiratory rate 16, 94% on room air.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, within normal
limits.  Heart examination, regular rate and rhythm, no
murmurs.  Chest excision, clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdominal examination, obese, soft, nontender, nondistended
without any masses palpable.  Genitourinary examination
showed normal scrotum, epididymis and testes without any
lesion and normal urethral meatus.  Rectal examination
revealed a prostate approximately 30 gm, normal to palpation,
soft without any nodules.  Extremities, no evidence of edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given clearance from Vascular Surgery
because of the history of abdominal aneurysm and having
discussed several options with the patient the decision was
made to proceed with surgery.  On  [**2645-12-1**], the
patient underwent left partial nephrectomy.  The procedure
was without any complications.  There was 500 cc blood loss.
The patient was transferred to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit
in stable condition.  His blood pressure and heartrate
remained stable.  The patient was then transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit over night for closer observation and
monitoring of his blood pressure.  He was continued on
intravenous fluids.  He was making good urine.  His
[**Location (un) 618**]-[**Location (un) 619**] drain was in place with serosanguinous
discharge.  His Foley catheter remained in place.  His
postoperative hematocrit was 32.6 with stable electrolytes.
His pain was controlled with patient controlled anesthesia.
He was also given Toradol with good relief.  A chest x-ray
was performed postoperatively which showed no evidence of
pneumothorax.  On postoperative day #1 the patient's fluids
were slowly decreased.  His diet was advanced to sips, to
clears which he tolerated well.  The patient was noted to
have marginal oxygen saturation and respiratory care was
consulted for nebulizer treatments.  He was transferred from
the Intensive Care Unit to the regular floor on postoperative
day #1.  On postoperative #2 he was noted to have a
temperature of 101.2.  His incision remained clean, dry and
intact.  There was noted to be a small area of redness
posterior to the incision which was blanching and did not
increase in size and was nontender.  The patient was started
on p.o. Levaquin prophylactically.  In addition the patient
was noted to be wheezing on pulmonary examination with a
small amount of bibasilar crackles.  A chest x-ray was
obtained on postoperative day #2 which showed cardiomegaly
and small right pleural effusion without any other signs of
volume overload.  His fluids were discontinued.  The
patient's diet was advanced to regular which he tolerated
well.  He had a bowel movement on postoperative day #3.  His
[**Location (un) 618**]-[**Location (un) 619**] drain was removed on postoperative day #2.  His
Foley catheter was removed at midnight on postoperative day
#3 and he voided without difficulty.  The patient was
ambulating and physical therapy was consulted.  The patient's
pain medication was switched to oral.  The patient was
discharged to home on postoperative day #3 in stable
condition.
