   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo M with diabetes, hyperlipedemia, and hypertension without past
   known CV disease presents with chest discomfort and ST depression
   consistent with NSTEMI.
   #Aortic stenosis: Scheduled for CABG, aortic valve replacement next
   week.  Patient is high risk for surgery, particularly if MR continues
   to be present and if patient would need both aortic and mitral valve
   replacement.  Moderate MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], though [**Last Name (Titles) **] does not show up in
   computer system.  Patient feels is his only option.  Pre-op workup
   complete, urinalysis, carotid ultrasound done yesterday (<40% stenosis
   bilaterally).
   - Appreciate CT [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Has been loaded with amiodarone twice, continues
   on PO doses 400mg [**Hospital1 **].  Started anticoagulation yesterday after episode
   of Afib.
   - can decrease dose to 200mg [**Hospital1 **] tomorrow
   - cont low dose beta blocker
   - cont heparin gtt; no utility in starting warfarin now if he goes to
   surgery early next week
   # NSTEMI: s/p Cath with stenting of RCA with BMS
   - continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - no ACE-i currently given [**Last Name (un) 2359**] and low pressures
   # Acute on Chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Symptoms improved
   w diuresis
   - cont lasix gtt at slower rate, I/O goal -500cc, w close monitoring of
   electrolytes
   - continue low dose beta blocker at 12.5mg metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]
   # Acute on chronic kidney failure: The patient has a [**Hospital1 4481**]
   creatinine of 1.2-1.4. On presentation at 1.6, now 2.6.  Likely due to
   poor forward flow as a result of aortic stenosis.  Patient however
   needs continued diuresis in order to get surgical aortic valve repair,
   which would improve his forward cardiac flow.
   - will trend creatinine, lytes [**Hospital1 **].
   # Diabetes: controlled on metformin at home
   - continue on glargine.
   - ISS
 adjust prn
   - Hold oral home meds
   # Hypertension: Patient is now normotensive in setting of mild
   cardiogenic shock.
   - Hold ACEi given compromised kidney function
   - Hold Nifedipine
   - Continue with low dose beta blocker as pressure tolerates to control
   heart rate
    # Trauma to face, s/p fall onto right side.  Patient denies LOC,
   altered sensorium, weakness, palpitations, preceding chest pain, and
   postictal state.  Patient is neurologically intact on exam.  No broken
   bones visible on CXray.
   - Will monitor for continued signs and symptoms.
   - See trauma note.
   # Pernictious anemia. Treated with B12 by PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Hct 36-39.
