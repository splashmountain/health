Cardiac catheterization with cypher stent placement

History of Present Illness:
   62yo M former tobacco smoker with family history of early CAD
presents with episode of chest pain.  The chest pain is
described as crushing chest pain located across the chest.  The
pain occurred while asleep at 2AM and woke him up.  There was no

transferred directly to the catheterization lab.  In hindsight,
he reports an episode of shortness of breath while shoveling
dirt in his driveway the day prior to admission.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**3449-3-23**]:
COMMENTS:
  1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system.
The RCA had a long 60% mid vessel lesion and was totally
occluded in the
mid to distal vesel with left to right collaterals to the distal
vessel.
The LMCA had a 60% distal lesion. The LAD had a 70% mid vessel
lesion.
The D1 had a 70% lesion. The LCX had a 70% ostial lesion. The
first
major OM had a 80% lesion.
  2. Hemodynamics post PCI showed normal central pressure,
mildly
elevated left sided filling pressures, and a normal cardiac
index.
  3. After the export catheter was used during the procedure,
the
patient had a bradycardic episode to HR 32 with decreased blood
pressure
- which required atropine. Pacer was introduced, but patient did
not
require pacing.
  4. Successful Primary PCI of the RCA with two overlapping
Cypher DES
(3.5 x 33 mm, post-dilated with a 4.0 mm balloon, and 3.0 x 33
mm,
post-dilated with a 3.5 mm balloon).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mildly elevated left sided filling pressure.
3. Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by acute PCI of
the
RCA.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Moderate
regional LV systolic dysfunction. No LV mass/thrombus.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no
atherosclerotic plaque.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. Mild to moderate
([**12-24**]+) MR. LV inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Borderline PA systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
akinesis of the inferior wall and hypokinesis of the
infero-septum and infero-lateral walls. No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending, transverse and
descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. Mild to moderate ([**12-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.




Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 61yo M former tob smoker with family history of early CAD
who presents with STEMI s/p cath with 3VD and PCI of RCA.
.
1.  CV:
A).  Coronaries: Pt presented to OSH with chest pain and was
found to have an STEMI.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 68**], where he
underwent urgent cardiac catheterization.  The cath demonstrated
left main and 3v CAD and the patient underwent a PCI of RCA
which was thought to be the culprit lesion based on angiographic
findings.  After his cardiac catheterization, he was monitored
on telemetry and managed medically.  He was initially ordered
for metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] which was subsequently held and then
d/c'd due to bradycardia.  He was started on ACEI which he
tolerated as well as ASA and Plavix.  He was also given lipitor
80mg QHS initially, but this was also stopped due to elevated
LFT.  The patient requires a repeat LFT and Cholesterol panel as
outpatient to be re-evaluated for statin therapy.  Pt was
successfully rate and pressure controlled with goal of: HR <70
and SBP <120.  The patient received a surgical evaluation for
possible CABG on [**3449-4-5**], he was already evaluated by anesthesia
while in house as well.  Pt is to call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 287**] for an
outpatient appointment as he still requires a carotid US prior
to undergoing CABG.
.
B).  Pump: Pt with STEMI, and unknown pre-MI cardiac function.
TTE demonstrates a reduced EF of 35%.  Given lack of clinical
findings of CHF, he was not actively diuresed.  He was however
counseled on fluid and salt balance and given some education on
dietary control.
.
C).  Rhythm: The patient was monitored on telemtry during the
duration of his stay and he was in NSR to sinus bradycardia
during his admission.  His bradycardia limitted use of beta
blocker.  This should be re-addressed as an outpatient.
.
D).  Primary risk reduction:  The patient was initially started
on lipitor 80mg QHS given his ACS.  However due to slightly
elevated LFT, the statins were held.  We recommend outpatient
follow up of his LFT and cholesterol.  If LFTs are normal, the
patient will benefit from statins.  The patient was counsel on
lifestyle, diet, and exercise and their impact on his
cardiovascular as well as generalized health.  Even though his
FS and glucose on chemistries were wnl, his A1c was 6.4
suggesting some degree of glucose intolerance.  We recommend an
outpatient follow up of his glucose and A1c levels as
uncontrolled blood sugars have been shown to have an effect on
mortality.
.
.
2.  LBP: pt with hx of LBP.  He was given percocet PRN after
cath with good control.
.
.
3.  Elevated LFT: AST:ALT of 2.5 to 1 ratio suggestive of
possibly Alc liver disease.  Currently no sign of cirrhosis with
intact synthetic function.  Although he was initially started on
lipitor, this was stopped once his LFT were returned.  Suggest
outpatient LFT check and re-administration of lipitor if
possible.
.
.
4.  PPx: Pt was initially on integrillin after cath and then
subsequently on Heparin subQ TID for DVT prophylaxis.  Colace,
senna for bowel regimen, and PPI for ICU stress were also given
during his stay.
