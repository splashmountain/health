   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with multiple medical problems including long
   standing metastatic breast cancer, severe pulmonary hypertension,
   emphysema, atrial fibrillation, presenting with worsened hypoxia and
   chest pain, with minimal ST changes, now pain free and in stable
   condition.
   .
   # ANGINA: Given patients severely limited functional status, it is
   difficult to assess degree of progression. Taking into consideration
   known hypoxia with ambulation and significant volume overload at
   presentation, this is much less likely due to acute coronary artery
   occlusion and instead likely represents demand ischemia in the setting
   above. Lastly, chest pain has been primary manifestation of sternal
   breast cancer metastasis and this may be a component of current
   episode.
   At this time, STEMI / coronary artery occlusion is unlikely. Patient
   high risk for bleeding with further anticoagulation and pain free at
   this time.
   -- Hold heparin, INR 3.5
   -- Trend enzymes, repeat ECG unchanged.  Pt remains chest apin free.
   -- Given bradycardia, will hold nifedipine for now, restart nifedepine
   if HR allows
   -- Continue atorvastatin at home dose, will not "load" with 80mg
   -- Defer cardiac cath until clinical picture is more clear
   -- Will need to have primary oncologist weigh in on potential anginal
   and tromboembolic risk of Letroxole ([**Age over 90 12062**])
   -- If ST changes / clinical situation worsens, will need Vitamin K /
   FFP for INR reversal, Heparin gtt initiation for cath.
   - continue home nitro patch.  if not sufficient to prevent chest pain,
   will d/c and start  nitro drip.
   #. BRADYCARDIA: Likely medication effect in setting of acute renal
   failure (Nifedipine), although need to consider increased vagal tone
   from myocardial ischemia. RCA occlusion less likely given underlying
   rhythm is atrial fibrillation and not sinus bradycardia
   -- Hold nodal agents for now
   -- If improves (HR > 50 x 2 hrs) will restart metoprolol to avoid RVR
   #. ACUTE SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Patient grossly volume overloaded on
   exam. Unlikely to be due to medication error given trained caregivers
   [**Name (NI) 12063**] all meds. Suspect this has been gradual deterioration leading
   to acute exacerbation, however ischemia must also be considered
   -- Goal -1L today.  Continue Lasix drip to achieve this effect slowly.
   -- Follow O2 requirement
   -- Avoid RVR as above
   -- Hold [**Last Name (un) **] given ARF
   #. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Unclear etiology, however given volume overload
   suspect poor forward flow from CHF is most likely etiology.
   -- Renally dose meds (Gabapentin, etc)
   -- Hold Valsartan as above
   -- Diuresis with furosemide
   # HYPOXIA: Multifactorial in setting of pulm hypertension, volume
   overload with pulmonary edema, emphysema and what appears to be a right
   lower lobe infiltrate on x-ray
   -- Recent levoquin course, will treat with ceftriaxone + azithromycin x
   5 days, day [**3-2**]
   -- Supplemental O2 to maintain sat 92-94% and avoid hypoxic
   vasoconstriction
   -- Diuresis as above
   # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Well rate controlled,
   --  Hold warfarin given INR 3.5, reassess in am
   -- restart metoprolol when tolerates
   #  BREAST CANCER: On [**Last Name (LF) 12062**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] continue while in house with caution
   as this may be provoking angina.
