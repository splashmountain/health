   Assessment and Plan
   49 M found to have staphlyococcus aureus bacterial endocarditis with
   severe mitral regurgitation [**1-18**] mitral valve vegetations and [**Month/Day (2) 5708**]
   leaflet, course c/b sepsis, neurological deficits.
    # Mitral valve staphylococcus aureus endocarditis/ Sepsis [**1-18**]
   staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: BCx grew out GPC in pairs/clusters.
   Pt was febrile in the setting of OR yesterday, WBC stable at 14. ECHO
   shows large vegetation on mitral valve, probable small vegetation on
   aortic valve.  Cx by acute MV regurgitation
   - cont nafcillin for MSSA 2g q4h
   - continue daily surveillance cultures: last positive cx on [**11-13**]
   - f/u cardiac surgery evaluation for surgical repair of mitral valve
   leaflet given hypotension and likely septic emboli to brain
   - requires teeth pulled prior to CT surgery
   - check serial ECG to follow for heart block
   - [**Hospital1 **] Lytes
   - monitor for new embolic events: if abdominal pain worsens would
   consider CT abdomen to evaluate for emboli to small bowel
   - f/u ID recs
   # Neurological deficits - had CT head at [**Location (un) 190**] read as small infarct
   in the anterior and posterior circulation suspicious for septic emboli.
   Neuro exam here with generalized weakness, left side ptosis and facial
   droop.  Palate rises asymmetrically.  Pt lost sensation to RUE and RLE
   [**11-15**], increased weakness on R side, R sided neglect. Repeat CT head
   shows mutiple bilateral infarcts.
   - MRI head and spine once patient stabilized
   - repeat CT angio head/neck in 2 weeks to r/o mycotic aneurysm
   - final treatment would be surgery, however remains high risk of
   hemorrhagic conversion (approx 50%)
   - f/u neuro recs.
   # Respiratory Distress
 increasing respiratory distress in the setting
   of acute MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5708**] leaflet/ MV vegetation.  CXR consistent with
   pulmonary edema, no evidence for PNA.  Currently sating low 90s on 4L
   NC + high flow shovel mask.  Has low BP making further after load
   reduction with vasodilators difficult
   - Lasix gtt: titrate to UOP of 50cc/hr
   - CT surgery recs
   - follow O2 requirement
   #ARF
 worsening creatinine to 1.5 today (baseline 0.4) in setting of
   multiple renal infarcts, recent gentamycin use, contrast load and low
   CO from MR.  Repeat lytes against pre renal etiology. [**Month (only) 8**] be ATN from
   IV dye, medications.
   -Continue to monitor UOP
   - Lasix gtt >100cc/hr
   - renally dose all meds
   - check Creatinine in pm
   #Olecranon bursistis s/p washout
 no evidence of infection as per OR
   report and initial gram stain. Wound vac in place
   - f/u fluid cx - negative to date
   #Hypotension
 [**1-18**] to sepsis. Pt weaned off levophed [**11-15**].
   - UOP has improved with milrinone, would continue
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD but heavy smoker
   # PUMP: Bedside ECHO done [**11-15**]. EF 55-60%.
   # RHYTHM:  Sinus tachycardia likely [**1-18**] volume depletion and
   bacteremia.
   #ACCESS: Right IJ triple lumen catheter
 placed [**11-15**]
