   Assessment and Plan
   89F with PMH significant for HTN, hypothyroidism, no prior cardiac
   history presenting with new AF, CHF.
   # PUMP:  On exam pt is volume overloaded with elevated JVP, crackles,
   some mild LE edema.  Based on imaging pt has significant cardiomegaly.
   At risk for LVH/diastolic dysfunction in setting of HTN. Also has DM so
   at risk for silent ischemia/ischemic cardiomyopathy.
   -Strict I/Os
   -Lasix 40mg IV now (did not respond to 20 in ED)
   -TTE in am
   -hold ACEI for low BP and hyperkalemia
   # RHYTHM:  Unknown if this AF is new, never documented before and pt
   markedly symptomatic.  Likely she was dependent on her atrial kick in
   setting of probable depressed cardiac function.  Ideally would like to
   consider CV for restoration of sinus rhythm. As duration of AF unknown
   will refrain from amio for rate control overnight to avoid accidental
   chemical CV.
   -check TSH
   -Dilt gtt prn for rates >90
   -Hep gtt o/n
   -d/w EP (pt and daughter requesting Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2767**] who is personal
   friend) options for TEE CV.
   -Coumadin initiation prior to d/c.
   -monitor for infectious etiologies for AF, UA is bland, afebrile. Got
   levaquin 1 dose in ED for ? PNA, imaging/exam/history not c/w PNA, will
   not continue.
   # CORONARIES:  No known history of CAD. ECG without acute ischemic
   changes.
   -ASA
   -repeat ECG this am
   # Hyperkalemia: Unclear etiology, Cr mildly elevated from baseline, but
   not high enough to explain hyperkalemia. On ACEI, no other culprit
   meds.
   -tx hyperkalemia agressively in setting of potential CV.
   -hold ACEI
   # DM2.  Not insulin dependent at home. Holding oral agents in house s/p
   contrast load.  Was hyperglycemic in ED in setting of receiving D5 in
   bicarbonate.
   -FSBS
   -ISS
   -diabetic diet
   #Hypothyroidism - Check TSH
   -continue replacement.
   FEN: NPO for ? CV, otherwise cardiac diabetic diet. Hyperkalemia mgmt
   as above. No IVF as volume overloaded.
   ACCESS: PIV's x 2
   PROPHYLAXIS:  On heparin gtt
