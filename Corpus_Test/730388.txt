   Imaging: CT ABD/Pelvis [**5-13**]
   1. Atonic, dilated, stool-filled rectum and colon.
   2. No evidence of proximal obstruction.
   3. Bibasilar aspiration.
   .
   [**5-13**] Port Abd FINDINGS: Single supine abdominal radiograph is reviewed
   without comparison.
   The diaphragms, and portions of the upper abdomen are not included on
   current
   study. There is no sign of free intraperitoneal air on this single
   supine
   view. Multiple distended loops of colon are seen, measuring up to 10
   cm. No
   definite pneumatosis is seen, though evaluation is limited by the large
   amount
   of stool throughout the colon. Note is made of IVC filter at the level
   of L1.
   IMPRESSION: Multiple distended loops of colon of uncertain
   significance. CT
   recommended for further evaluation.
   .
   CXR [**5-13**] IMPRESSION:
   1. No free air, but multiple distended loops of bowel seen in the upper
   abdomen. CT recommended for further evaluation.
   2. Slightly improved left basilar aeration, but residual retrocardiac
   opacity
   and likely left effusion persists.

   Assessment and Plan
   /P: 52 yo male with ALS, chronically vent dependent with G tube,
   presents with severe constipation, hematemesis and sepsis
   # Sepsis: Had fever to 102.5 upon arrival to ED. Per nursing home he
   has not been having fevers but was recently treated for "leukocytosis"
   with unasyn and vanco.  Was intermittently being straight-cathed.
   Unclear where/when foley was placed. Also, has midline in place that
   was placed at outside facility on [**4-19**]. Likely source of infection is
   UTI, but also consider pneumonia given chronically vented and is having
   secretions. Also, consider C. diff given recent antibiotic and dilated
   colon.
   - if this is not new foley, then should replace
   - sputum culture
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures
   - stool for C.diff
   - d/c midline
   - give ceftaz, vanco, flagyl to treat broadly given chronically vented
   and in a facility, has had pseudomonas in sputum, coag negative staph
   bacteremia in the recent past, and is at risk for bowel translocation
   given dilated bowel loops
   - Bolus IVFs to keep MAPS 60, UOP>50 cc/hr
   - place CVL if BPs remain low and has poor UOP
   - monitor lactate
   # Constipation: Patient has been having increasing abdominal
   distention. Seems that he has had chronic problem with constipation. No
   evidence of obstruction on KUB or CT scan.  Surgery saw in ED and
   disimpacted. Also, consider c.diff
   - Lactulose 30 ml QID, titrate to BM
   - prn enemas
   - NPO
   - appreciate surgery recs
   - monitor abdominal exam
   # Hematemesis:  Has history of bleed around G tube site. HCT currently
   stable. No output for NG or G-tube
   - Q6H HCT
   - GI aware and will likely scope
   - Hold ASA for now
   - 2 large bore PIVs, and CVL if needed
   - active type and crossmatch
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   # Chronic vent dependence/respiratory failure: Currently satting well.
   Does have significant secretions
   - HOB >15 degrees
   - mouth care
   .
   # ALS: continue baclofen
   .
   # Psych: continue zoloft, remeron
   .
   # Glucose intolerance: Currently hold TFs. 1/2 dose Q6h regular insulin
   sliding scale
   .
   #FEN: Hold TFs for now, replete lytes
   .
   #ACCESS: d/c  left midline, PIV 18# x2
   .
   #PPx: SQ heparin, has IVC filter in
   .
   #CODE: full code, per OMR d/c summary. Has been seen by palliative care
   in the past, but did not want to partake in discussions. Would likely
   benefit from another palliative care consult and family meeting in Am
   with the [**Hospital1 960**] interpretor
