   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo man with a h/o DM I with insulin autoantibody receptor syndrome,
   ESRD, PVD, dCHF p/w DKA and non-working HD graft.
   .
   # Nonworking graft: Presumed rethrombosed. Went to OR on [**5-8**] for graft
   thrombectomy and revision, was cleared from OR to use graft for HD.
   However, prior to HD graft went down. Underwent repeat procedure in OR
   [**5-9**]. Graft functioned appropriately for HD yesterday.
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Appreciate renal recs
   .
   # Blood pressure: Patient with brief episode of hypotension on [**3310-5-8**]
   but responded well to fluid bolus, currently normotensive
   - Follow blood pressure post HD
   - Continue home dose of metoprolol 50 TID
   - Continue to hold home minoxidil, dilt, doxazosyn
   .
   # ESRD:  Graft used successfully for HD yesterday PM post-revision.
   - Trend lytes if patient will agree to labs
   - Epo in HD
   - Zemplar in HD
   - Continue sevelamer
   - Hold calcitriol and PO iron
   - F/U renal recs
   .
   # DKA: Pt noncompliant with insulin; hyperglycemia may also have been
   precipitated by pneumonia or other infection. Gap initially 23, now
   closed with normoglycemia. Currently on home lantus and sliding scale.
   Episode of ASX hypoglycemia this AM.
   - Seen by [**Last Name (un) 257**] (appreciate recs)
   - Continue sliding scale per most recent [**Last Name (un) 257**] recs
   - Will discuss best home SS with [**Last Name (un) 257**] team as patient has been
   non-compliant in past and no revisions to scale in some time
   .
   # ? Pneumonia: Given recent hospitalizations and HD pt, will cover
   broadly for HCAP. Pt is DM but does not have h/o pseudomonas infection
   and BP currently stable. Coarse BS on initial exam, refuses repeat exam
   this morning. Afebrile. Still no read on CXR from yesterday, today
   continued opacity in RLL. Abx stopped yesterday given afebrile, normal
   white count.
   - F/U final reads of CXR [**5-9**] and [**5-10**]
   - Consider resume Abx if febrile
   .
   # Elevated troponin: Has been flat at ~0.3 over multiple sets of
   enzymes; no rise in CK-MB noted. Therefore, likely elevated troponin is
   due to ESRD.
   - Trend CE, telemetry
   - Restart aspirin once cleared by surgery
   .
   # Immunosuppression: On prednisone per med list (restarted yesterday)
   for insulin Ab production.
   - Continue prednisone for now
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Check TSH given c/o increased fatigue
   - Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # Capacity: Patient threatened earlier this admission to leave AMA. He
   has been declared to lack capacity to do so in the past given poor
   insight into his disease condition and lack of safe place to go. Son
   serves as limited guardian. Psych recs as above. Currently, pt cannot
   leave AMA. Will continue to work with family. Patient needs guardian.
   - F/U legal recs
   - F/U further psych recs
   .
   # FEN: 50 cc/hr D5W, replete electrolytes (K only if low), regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals (1 in foot currently)
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full - discussed at length with HCP. Pt has been DNR/DNI in
   the past but with recent discussions, uncertain of current feelings as
   he has been grateful for resuscitative efforts after the fact.  Ok to
   intubate for reversible situation (e.g. PNA and fluid overload).
   Pressors ok.  Less certain about CPR/defibrillation.
   # Disposition:  observe in the peridialysis period, if hemodynamically
   stable then call out to floor
