Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast in the body of the LA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection
velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Moderately dilated ascending
aorta. Mildly dilated aortic arch. Simple atheroma in aortic
arch. Mildly dilated descending aorta. Complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severe AS (AoVA
<0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-29**]+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification. Moderate valvular MS (MVA
1.0-1.5cm2) Mild to moderate ([**1-29**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. See Conclusions for post-bypass data The
post-bypass study was performed while the patient was receiving
vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of
medications).
Conclusions

PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic arch is
mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-29**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
6. There is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**1-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including Epinephrine and
Phenylephrine and is being A paced.

1. A bioprosthetic valve is well seated in the Aortic position.
Leaflets open well. A mild paravalvular leak is noted from the
Aorto-mitral junction site.This did not improve with protamine
or correction of coagulopathy. Mean gradient is 10 mm of Hg.
2. LV function is preserved. RV mildly hypokinetic that improved
with inotropes.
3. MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5480**] to be around 1.5 cm2, with a mean gradient of
6 mm of Hg.
4. Ascending aortic graft is noted.
5. Other findings are unchanged


Brief Hospital Course:
She was taken to the operating room on [**3-27**] where she underwent
an AVR and replacement of ascending aorta. She was transferred
to the ICU in stable condition. She was extubated and weaned
from her vasoactive drips on POD #3. She initially had a high
ozygen requirement but improved over several days. She was also
initially confused but also improved with time. She was ready
for transfer to the floor on POD #6. She developed atrial
fibrillation and was treated with increased beta blockade and
amiodarone. She converted to sinus rhythm. No coumadin started.
CT / Foley / PW out with no sequele. PT consult. Pt stable for
home. Was treated fot UTI on cipro x 3 days
