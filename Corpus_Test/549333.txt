   pleural effusion and small
   dependent left pleural effusion. Decreasing peripheral consolidation,
   left
   upper lobe, but worsening opacification in right middle and lower lobes
   which
   may be due to atelectasis and/or infection. Spiculated left lower lobe
   nodule
   for which short-term followup CT is recommended to exclude a
   malignancy. "
   Assessment and Plan
   54-year old woman with biopsy proven COP/RBILD and history of prolonged
   respiratory failure now with MRSA pneumonia (acquired prior to
   admission) and pleural effusions.  It is not completely clear how much
   of this is infection and how much is her underlying lung disease.
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   -          MRSA on culture
   -          On vancomycin.  Change to dosing by level.
   -          Concern exists for parapneumonic effusion.  Will consult IP
   and try to obtain pleural fluid today after giving FFP.
 CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT (CABG)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   -          resolved
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   -          add atrovent
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   -          diuresis today with goal -500 or more negative
 .H/O INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE (ILD INCLUDING IPF, UIP, NSIP, DIP,
   LIP, ETC)
   -          maintain present doses of steroids.  If unable to wean from
   ventilator after longer ABX course may consider higher-dose steroids.
