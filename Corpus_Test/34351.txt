REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   eval for pneumothorax s/p chest tube removal



Final Report
AP CHEST.

HISTORY: Evaluate for pneumothorax following chest tube removal.


FINDINGS: Comparison is made to previous study from [**2848-7-1**] at 10:19
a.m.

The left basilar chest tube has been removed. There remains a
tiny apical
pneumothorax which is decreased in size since the prior study of
10:19 a.m.
There is a small right-sided pleural effusion. There is
unchanged
cardiomegaly and median sternotomy wires.

Echo:
Pre-CPB:
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 40 - 45%).
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. Area =
0.6. Peak gradient = 70. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB:
The patient is on an infusion of epinephrine, and is AV-Paced.
Good biventricular systolic fxn.
A prosthetic aortic valve is well-seated with no leak and no AI.
Mean gradient = 8.
Aorta intact.
Mitral prosthesis still well-seated and functioning.

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt was admitted to the hospital on [**2848-6-7**] for a heparin
bridge to surgery, as well as complete preop workup.
The pt was brought to the operating room on [**6-11**] and underwent
Redo sternotomy with first-time aortic valve replacement using a
23-mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 262**] Regent mechanical prosthesis as well as coronary
artery bypass grafting x2 of the left internal
    mammary artery, the left anterior descending coronary
    artery; reverse saphenous vein single graft from the
    aorta to the  first diagonal coronary artery.  The pt
received vancomycin as periop prophylaxis because he was
inpatient pre-op.  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and postoperatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for observation and recovery.  POD #1 found the pt
extubated, alert and oriented, and breathing comfortably.  He
was hemodynamically stable, on no inotropic or vasopressor
support at this time.  He was found suitable for transfer to the
floor.  Digoxin was held for bradycardia.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  The pt
made excellent progress with physical therapy, showing good
strength and balance before discharge.  Anticoagulation was
managed with a heparin bridge to coumadin with goal INR of 2.5 -
3.5.  The patient was found to cough while drinking thin
liquids.  Video swallow evaluation was performed and diet
restrictions were adjusted appropriately.  By the time of d/c on
POD 5 the pt was ambulatin freely, the wound was healing and
pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  He was d/c'd to rehab
in good condition.
