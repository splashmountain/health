History of Present Illness:
64 year old male who was initially admitted to Good Samariton on
[**5-12**] with complaint of left sided chest pain which he states
that he had for years and COPD exacerbation. At OSH patient had
CTA which was negative for PE but showed RLL, RML, and LLL
infiltrates suggestive of PNA. Patient was started on
ceftriaxone and levofloxacin which he recieved for 7 days and
was stopped because patient had 2 days of diarrhea. At the OSH
patient sputum cx came back positive for group B strep. Patient
was started on Aspirin, Imdur, Lopressor, and Plavix at the OSH
and stated that his CP resolved after 2 days. Cardiac enzymes
were sent and patient had flat CK but elevated Troponin that
peaked to 2.15 and then trended down. Patient underwent
dobutamine stress atthe OSH which showed lateral ischemia. He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 4**] for cardiac catherization. Patient
currently states that he his breathing at his baseline and is CP
free. No orthopnea or PND, however patient unable to climb more
than 1 flight of stairs [**1-18**] SOB.
.
ROS: Patient denies and fever/chills. He denies any cough.
Currently denies any diarrhea, BRBPR, melena. No HA, n/v,
lightheadedness.

.
Cardiac Cath [**2609-5-22**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system
with three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had a 50%
ostial
lesion. The LAD had a 60% mid vessel lesion with a 90% ostial
stenosis
at the first diagonal branch. The moderately calcified
non-dominant LCX
had serioal 80% lesions in the AV groove vessel leading to a 90%

proximal stenosis of the OM1. The OM2 and OM3 no
angiographically
apparent flow limiting lesions. The RCA had a proximal occlusion
with
left to right collateral.
  2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal right sided and
left sided
pressures with mildly elevated pulmonary pressures (mean PA 26
mmHg) and
moderately elevated systemic pressures (central aortic pressure
172/71
mmHg). The cardiac index was mildly depressed (2.1 l/min/m2).
  3. Left ventriculography showed no wall motion abnormalities
(EF 60%).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
3. Mild precapillary pulmonary hypertension
.


Brief Hospital Course:
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system
with three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had a 50%
ostial lesion. The LAD had a 60% mid vessel lesion with a 90%
ostial stenosis at the first diagonal branch. The moderately
calcified non-dominant LCX had serioal 80% lesions in the AV
groove vessel leading to a 90% proximal stenosis of the OM1. The
OM2 and OM3 no angiographically apparent flow limiting lesions.
The RCA had a proximal occlusion with left to right collateral.
Left ventriculography showed no wall motion abnormalities with
an LVEF of 60%. Based on the above results, cardiac surgery was
consulted for coronary revascularization.

Further evaluation included pulmonary consultation given his
severe COPD. He was maintained on MDI and nebulizers and was
cleared to proceed with surgery. A preoperative carotid
ultrasound was notable for bilateral mild internal carotid
artery stenosis of less than 40%. He otherwise remained stable
on medical therapy.

On [**5-25**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17385**] performed three vessel coronary
artery bypass grafting utilizing the LIMA to LAD, SVG to
diagonal and SVG to obtuse marginal. Following the operation, he
was brought to the CSRU. Within 24 hours, he was extubated. MDI
and nebulizer therapies were resumed. Chest tubes were removed
and he transferred to the Step Down Unit on postoperative day
two. Later that night, he experienced acute respiratory distress
secondary to a right pneumothorax. A chest tube was urgently
placed and he returned to the CSRU. His respiratory status
gradually improved over several days and he eventually
transferred back to the SDU.

Despite chest tube placement, serial chest x-rays were notable
for persistent right pneumothorax. The thoracic service was
consulted and recommended a chest CT scan which confirmed a
small right pneumothorax, and pneumomediastinum with small
bilateral pleural effusions. It also showed diffuse
centrilobular emphysema with no focal lung consolidations. A new
chest tube was therefore placed on [**6-3**] and put to suction
while the "old" chest tube was eventually removed.
Unfortunately, the pneumothorax persisted. On [**6-5**], Doxy
pleurodesis was performed. The chest tube remained and serial
chest x-rays were performed. The chest tube was eventually
removed on [**6-7**]. The chest x-ray prior to removal was
notable for no significant residual right pneumothorax. The post
pull chest x-ray showed small, stable right apical pneumothorax.

From a cardiac standpoint, he maintained stable hemodynamics. He
tolerated beta blockade without significant wheezing. He
remained in a normal sinus rhythm without ventricular or atrial
arrhythmias. Beta blockade was advanced as tolerated. He
responded well to diuresis and by discharge, had oxygen
saturations of 92% on room air. He was medically cleared for
discharge on postoperative day 14. Pt. still with dyspnea on
exertion, states it is relieved by supplemental oxygen at
2L/minute prn. Repeat CXR this am showed small right apical ptx
(? somewhat smaller than post-pull film of [**6-7**])
