Chief Complaint:  resp failure, septic shock, transferred from [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Country **]
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:  Briefly, this is an  85 yo M with MMP, CAD, CRI, AF, CLL and
   chronic lung disease who is transferred from PR after a long hospital
   course c/b PNA, resp failure and septic shock following a fall.
   On arrival, hypotensive and in respiratory distress, bronched with
   evidence of severe necrotic PNA and L lung collapse. Fluid resuscitated
   and weaned off pressors overnight. Currently, intubated and sedated on
   A/C vent 500x12 c 5 PEEP and FiO2 0.5 with SPB 110 and paced rhythm at
   60 with occasional native beats.
