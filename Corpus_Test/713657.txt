   The patient is an 83yo M with a past medical history of aortic stenosis
   s/p bioprosthetic AVR, PAF on coumadin s/p TURP approximately 3 weeks
   ago presenting with hematuria. The patient reports that 1 week prior to
   presentation he passed 2 large blood clots with urination with small
   amount of bleeding. He had no further episodes of gross hematuria until
   the morning of [**3121-4-3**] when he experienced inability to urinate since
   3AM with gross blood and clots. The patient presented to [**Hospital1 52**] ED where
   he underwent foley placement with continuous bladder irrigation for
   several hours and reported heamturia cleared. INR 1.6. He was sent home
   on bactrim and foley in place with Urology follow up schedule for [**4-4**].
   .
   The patient represented to ED with recurrent hematuria from foley,
   continued pain and decreased urine output. On arrival to ED, initial
   vitals: T 97.7 HR 83 BP 145/62 98% on RA. He was found to have a HCT of
   23.2. T&S sent. He was given ceftriaxone 1gm IV, morphine 4mg IVX2,
   diluadid 1mg IV. Urology was consulted and the a rouche catheter was
   placed with subsequent successful irrigation. INR found to be 3.1 and
   Cr 1.8. 2U PRBC ordered.
   .
   He was then stable on the medical floor until approximately 9pm on
   [**3121-4-4**] when he acutely felt ill with confusion, diaphoresis and
   nausea.  He denies chest pain, shortness of breath or palpitations.  He
   then became hypotensive with blood pressure in the 80s systolic.  He
   was given a fluid bolus and blood pressure responded to the 90s-100s.
   ECG was done which showed a RBBB and peaked T waves in V3-V6, otherwise
   no ST or T wave changes.  His symptoms persisted. He was given a total
   of 3 units of PRBCs since admission and HCT was 23 on repeat (unchanged
