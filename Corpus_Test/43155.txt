TTE
PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is heavy calcification
of the non-coronary cusp. There is moderate aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Trace
to mild mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results at time of surgery.
POST-BYPASS: The patient is AV paced. The patient is on no
inotropes. Biventricular function is unchanged. Mitral
regurgitation is unchanged. Aortic stenosis and aortic
insufficiency are unchanged. The aorta is intact
post-decannulation.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient had minimally elevated troponins and was pain free
on Heparin.  Catheterization revealed significant disesase and
revascularization was undertaken.  On [**9-28**] he went to the
Operating Room where sextuple bypass was performed.  He weaned
from bypass on Propofol, Neo Synephrine and Insulin infusions.

He was extubated on POD 1 and weaned from pressors.  Beta
blockers and diuretics were begun.  Physical Therapy was
consulted for strength and mobility.  Medications for
hypertension were titrated to good effect.  The Foley catheter
was reinserted for retention and Flomax was begun.  The catheter
will be left in at transfer to rehab and is to be removed for
another voiding trial after several days of Flomax.  chest tubes
and temporary pacemaker wires were removed per protocol without
incident.

The admission CXR revealed two small lesions of the left chest.
These have been present since [**2723**].  A CT scan demonstrated some
growth of these, along with apical scarring.  Thoracic surgery
was consulted and a PET-CT was recommended.  The patient refused
further workup or intervention at this time for the lung
nodules.  He will follow up with his primary care physician in
the future.

Discharge medications, restrictions and precautions are as
noted. Follow up appointments were also arranged. He was
discharged to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 78**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 72**] on POD 6 for further recovery prior
to returning home.
