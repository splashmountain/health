   Assessment and Plan
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular cancer as a child, p/w
   back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, now in septic
   shock still of unclear etiology.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Based on CXR, etiology seems most
   consistent with multifocal PNA and evolving ARDS.  Unlikely PE as a
   bandemia on diff.   The patient has evidence of pleural effusions, may
   be contributing to respiratory failure
   - intubated on CMV, no plan to wean
   - continue to treat for PNA w/ broad spectrum antibiotics to cover for
   MRSA, peusdomonas and atypicals w/ Vanc, Zosyn and Levofloxacin &
   Clindamycin for aspiration
   - sedation with fentanyl/midaz
   - Decrease PEEP to 8
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Source may
   be cholecystitis given CT findings. Continued on levophed. Urine output
   decreasing with evidence of third spacing.
   - Cover broadly with vanc/zosyn/levoflox/clindamycin as above (adjust
   vanc per troughs)
   - Percutaneous cholecystostomy denied by IR will follow recs
   #.  Metabolic Acidosis:  Likely secondary to worsening renal failure
   given Lactate normal
   - will likely undergo CVVH today
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN given poor response to fluid
   hydration.
   - Will likely require CVVH today for volume removal given decrease in
   urine output.
   - Follow renal recs
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Likely secondary to either
   medication effect or from overwhelming infection
   - consult heme/onc today
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, Resolving
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver
   - trend for now
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin for now
   # FEN: TPN given pending perc chole
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: RIJ placed [**1-1**], R femoral art line placed [**1-2**]
   # Code: full
   # Communication: Patient and his wife
   # Disposition: ICU for now
