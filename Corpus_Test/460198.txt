   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo F c HTN, DM, HLP p/w acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Neuro: Lethargic, arousable, looks tired today.  Uremia may
   contribute.
   Earlier reduction of fentanyl patch clearly helped MS, as did lactulose
   for a brief period.  She is currently off of lactulose and rifaxamin
   and hepatic encephalopathy is not thought to be contributing.  Classic
   picture of toxic metabolic, will likely clear with leg closure,
   increase HD clearance.
   - failed Passy-Muir trial, will retry later in hospitalization
   .
   # ID:  WBC has now completely resolved, fevers are low grade at best
   off tylenol. Early fevers [**1-5**] multiple nidi, including triple lumen,
   CVVH line, sacral skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being
   open and foley catheter.  Currently residual low grade fevers likely
   [**1-5**] chronic inflammation in leg.
   - All cx data negative
   - continue Vanc and  Zosyn, and plan to define course after closure
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   appears to be dialysis dependent.
   - Started HD [**10-24**] has now tolerated off pressors x 2
   .
   # Respiratory distress:  Now tolerating trach mask for increasing
   amounts of time, continue trach mask training
   - trach mask as tolerated
   - monitor fluid status and RR, continue trach mask trials
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy was likely [**1-5**] /hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.
   - transfused 1u yesterday and 1 unit the day before with appropriate
   Hct increase
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - renal rec
 on epo, with Iron
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having regular BMs off of lactulose.  NGT
   found to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per
   GI. Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. Had
   melenotic/frankly bloody bm [**10-7**], put on IV PPI.
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - BM regimen, hold lactulose
   - on tube feeds, tolerating advanced diet
   .
   .
   # compartment sx
 Likely developed [**1-5**] IABP use.  IABP now removed,
   patient s/p LLE fasciotomy.  Wound VAC placed.
   - per Vsurg: to OR in AM for closure
   - serial pulses
   .
   # IDDM
 insulin gtt, [**Last Name (un) **]-stim is negative for adrenal insufficiency.
   - d/c
d NPH [**Hospital1 **] and transitioned to lantus and ISS to uptitrate.
   - appreciate continued follow up by [**Last Name (un) 291**]
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Markedly elevated. Likely shock liver and rhabdo.
   -          Now WNL
   -          Following alk phos, ggt pending
   .
   # Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory: S/P BMS to
   LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more hemodynamically stable.
   Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9),
   now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic
   / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of compartment sx in LLE.  Reached
   goal CVP >12 for fluid resuscitated.  in NSR/sinus tach but had an
   episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off temp pacer at this time.  last
   TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient had been on heparin gtt but
   stopped [**1-5**] bleeding concerns.  Doing well off pressors.  Converted to
   sinus with amiodarone and  BB.   Currently in and out of sinus tach,
   responsive to beta-blockers.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home hypertensive regimen until more HD stable.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia
 Holding statin in setting of rhabdomyolysis /
   transaminitis/acute illness.
   .
   # FEN: On tube feeds at goal.
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   - DVT ppx if HCT stable
 SQ heparin
   - pain management IV fentanyl
   - bowel regimen (senna + colace), lactulose
