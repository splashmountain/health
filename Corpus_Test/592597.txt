   Imaging:
   CT Head: (final) 1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or
   major territorial infarct is apparent. Of note, MRI with
   diffusion-weighted sequences are more sensitive for evaluation of acute
   ischemia.
   2. Extensive sinus disease.
   CT C-spine: (final)
   1. No evidence of acute fracture or traumatic malalignment.
   2. Mild to moderate multilevel degenerative changes with central canal
   narrowing from posterior disc osteophyte complexes. Severe assymetric
   facetjoint degenerative disease on the left at C3-4.
   3. Extensive sinus disease. Dedicated CT sinus may be obtained to
   furtherevaluate as indicated.
   CT Chest: (prelim)
   1. Complete collapse of the left lower lobe and partial collapse of the
   right lower lobe, likely secondary to secretions. Small bilateral
   pleural effusions.
   2. Diffuse stranding around the body and tail of the pancreas which is
   concerning for pancreatitis. Clinical correlation is recommended. If
   there is clinical concern for pancreatitis, a CT of the abdomen may be
   obtained for further characterization.
   3. Bilateral indeterminate low-density lesions within the kidneys
   bilaterally which statistically most likely represent renal cysts. An
   ultrasound may be obtained for further characterization.
   4. Multiple right-sided rib fractures involving ribs one through five
   anteriorly and possible fracture of rib nine posteriorly.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 5931**] is a 62 yo man with CAD, CKD, DM who presents with
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest. Most likely primary arrhythmic event from possible
   hyperkalemia rather than secondary to ischemia.  Pt s/p multiple
   episodes of refractory VT and repeated cycles of CPR/shocks. d/c
   lidocaine gtt yesterday w/o further episodes of VT/arrhythmia.
   - continue amiodarone drip at 1mg/min
   - ACLS & lidocaine if recurs
   .
   # Hypoxia/respiratory failure:  pt with copious secretion and collapse
   of the LLL likely causing difficulty with hypoxia during the day
   yesterday.  s/p bronch by pulm and repeated suctioning to remove
   secretions.  Recruitment maneuver attempted yesterday but was
   unsuccessful [**1-19**] HoTN.  Likely etiology aspiration pneumonitis with
   some component of volume overload . Also consider infection given
   copious secretions but this less likely. Was started on propofol
   yesterday given concern for dysynchronous bretahing, but unclear that
   propofol improved his respiratory status or rate. FiO2 weaned to 70%.
   PEEP increased to 18.
   - f/u pulm recs
   - t/c BAL today to assess for infection
   - t/c esophageal balloon to assess optimal peep pressures.
   - wean PEEP and FiO2 as able
   - d/c propofol and continuously eval need for sedation
   - f/u CXR
   - diuresis as below
   - optimize respiratory mechanics
 ie hypoxia improved with Left side
   up.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: may be related to VT versus ischemia.  Pt still
   requiring pressors overnight. Still has Swan in place, but without
   clear utility at this point.
   - will attempt to wean dopamine today
   - d/c Swan today
   - ECHO today
   .
   # Coronary artery disease: LAD and RCA occlusions appeared to be old
   - continue ASA
   - d/c statin given likely elevation in LFT
s and short-tern risk vs
   benefit analysis
   - check LFTs
   - echo to eval for ischemia.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: resolved.  Thought to be primary from ARF & ACE given
   history, but also possibly secondary to acidosis
   - monitor K [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Mental status: has signs of severe CNS injury with bleak prognosis
   (decerebrate posturing; babinski, dilated pupils, oculocephalics not
   intact); likely anoxic brain injury.  CT head neg for ICH.  Most likely
   [**1-19**] to hypoperfusion. No improvement in exam noted since admission
   - EEG pending
   - d/c propofol
   - neuro recs appreciated.
   - will likely need to obtain MRI
   .
   # Tongue twitching: neurology c/s feels this is likely myoclonus.
   Seizure also on ddx
   - f/u EEG read
   .
   # Acute renal failure: likely due hypoperfusion in setting of cardiac
   arrest.  [**Month (only) 8**] develop ATN.  Still with good UOP.
   - monitor I/O
   - pt may require CVVH but no need for RRT at this time
   - appreciate renal recs
   - hold nephrotoxins
   - cont lasix gtt with bolus of lasix 60 IV this am.  Goal negative 1-2L
   today
   .
   # Pancreatitis: inflammation surrounding the pancreas noted
   incidentally on  CT chest.  Lipase elevated at 870 last night but down
   to 299 this am.  Pt s/p 7L of fluid
   - will limit further fluid resuscitation given difficulty with resp
   status.
   - trend lipase
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/c statin as discussed above
   .
   # Diabetes: insulin gtt d/c
ed overnight. Pt on humalog insulin sliding
   scale.
   - continue HISS
   .
   # PPX: heparin SQ, PPI
   .
   # Code: full.
