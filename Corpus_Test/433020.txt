   Imaging: CXR [**10-13**] - In comparison with the study of [**10-12**], there is
   little overall
   change. Again there is diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications
   consistent
   with the fibrosing stage of ARDS. Bibasilar pleural effusions with
   atelectatic changes at the bases. The possibility of superimposed
   consolidation, especially at the left base, cannot be excluded.
   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with a history of CAD, s/p tracheostomy following MVA with
   respiratory failure in the setting of bilateral opacities concerning
   for fibroproliferative ARDS, less likely diffuse infection.
   #  Respiratory failure: Stable, due to ARDS; compliance slightly
   improved with less elevated peak pressures; MRSA (9000 cfu/ml) and
   Klebsiella ([**3110**] cfu/ml) on [**10-7**] BAL, as well as sputum Cx [**10-4**]; fungal
   markers negative; lack of respiratory drive and poor compliance are
   barriers to weaning
   -cont vanc/[**Last Name (un) 600**] day 7 (last day [**3120-10-15**])
   -cont low Vt ventilation, will lower driving pressure to reduce peak
   pressures
   -wean sedation (10-20%/day) as Vt will tolerate, continue bolus
   sedation/anxiolytics (zyprexa) as gradual replacement for continuous
   infusion
   -cautious with high PEEP in the setting of pneumomediastinum
   #Hypotension
 multifactorial, most attributable to sedation, less
   likely neurogenic shock from CNS process or septic shock from VAP;
   currently hemodynamically stable off pressors
   -cautious fluid resuscitation given prior difficulty with
   oxygenation/ventilation in the setting of mild volume overload (CVP
   3-5)
   -titrate neo gtt to MAP>65 if BP drops
   -cont hold BB, ACEi
   .
   # Elevated Intracranial Pressure: ICP at goal <10; attributed to
   malabsorptive hydrocephalus following intracranial bleeding. Drain
   changed in OR on [**10-8**]
   -appreciate neurosurg involvement
   -plan for VP shunt when infectious issues resolved
   -MRI ordered but could not tolerate traveling to study due to low
   compliance & tidal volumes on vent
   -maintain ICP, goal <10
   -keppra at 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   Altered Mental Status - Difficult to assess given sedation, however, pt
   has reactive pupils and some primitive reflexes.
   - Continue to wean sedation
   - Neurosurg following
   - Will try for MRI again today if patient stable
   .
   # Macrocytic anemia: Hct stable
   - daily Hct
   - transfuse for Hct <21
   - guaiac all stools
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease:
   - restarted aspirin
   - holding plavix per neurosurg
   .
   # Scalp hematoma: No evidence of active bleed or infection.
   -Continue wound care
   .
   #  Depression:
   - restarted on fluoxetine per family request
