   Assessment and Plan
   81 yoF with a h/o dCHF, COPD and eosinophilic lung disease presents
   with acute onset of respiratory distress in setting of several days of
   worsening dyspnea.
   #. Dyspnea/SOB: Most likely etiology is exacerbation of chronic lung
   disease. This is supported by mild hypercarbia on ABG; of note, this
   was drawn at least fifteen minutes after the initiation of BiPAP, thus
   pCO2 may be slightly lower than in acute setting. Trigger for initial
   decompensation appears to be likely a viral URI. Reason for the
   patient's sudden decline on arrival to medical floor is less clear. PE
   or PTX are considerations, versus fatigue from increased work of
   breathing over several days.
   -continue BiPAP
   -repeat CXR now
   -emperic heparin gtt
   -consider CTA given intermediate d-dimer
   -standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   -methylprednisolone
   -no antiobiotics per patient request given history of recurrent C. Diff
   #. ECG changes: Most likely secondary to transient demand ischemia in
   setting of respiratory distress
   -repeat ECG now
   -heparin gtt as abobe
   -continue home ASA and statin
   -hold BB in setting of labile BP, however will restart as soon as able
   #. CHF: Pt does not appear sigificantly volume overloaded by physical
   exam or x-ray. Has required a single 500cc NS bolus for transiently low
   BP. Will attempt to limit additional fluids; hold home Lasix for now.
   #. Chronic cough: Has had some workup as an outpatient and is already
   on PPI, H2 blockers, nasal steroids and nasal risens. [**Month (only) 56**] represent
   manifestation of lung disease. Will continue PPI for now and monitor.
   #. Anemia: HCT currently at baseline. W/U in [**11-21**] c/w AOCD and
   possible Fe deficiency. [**Month (only) 56**] need further w/u as outpt.
