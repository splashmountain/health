   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 82 yo M with metastatic adenocarcinoma, systolic HF EF45%,
   and CRI who presents from rehab after recent admit for acute on CRI
   where meds were decreased with flash pulmonary edema in the setting of
   hypertensive urgency.
   .
   #  Respiratory Distress - [**1-28**] flash pulmonary edema in setting of HTN
   urgency. Recently lisinopril/lasix d/c'd, imdur and BB decreased. Also
   had WBC w/ left shift with CXR concerning for RLL infiltrate.
   - oxygen sats well on minimal 2L NC
   - cont diuresis, strict I/Os, daily weights
   - consider ACE if hyperkalemia resolves
   - can decrease abx coverage to levofloxacin x 5 days
   - prn albuterol/ipratropium
   - follow up blood cx, obtain sputum
   .
   # Hypertensive Urgency - Likely precipitated by recent decreases in
   medications.
   - off nitro gtt, can transition to labetolol if remains hypertensive on
   outpatient regimen
   - continue BB
   .
   # CAD - h/o NSTEMI in past. Troponin mildly elevated on admission,
   likely [**1-28**] demand in setting of hypertensive urgency.
   - cycle CEs
   - continue ASA, BB, imdur, statin, diures with lasix as above
   - consider lisinopril as above
   .
   #  h/o anemia - Hct significantly above baseline on admission. ?
   hemoconcentration.
   - continue to trend
   .
   #  CRI - at baseline, continue to follow and renally dose all meds
   .
   # Parkinson's Disease - Continue on outpt regimen
   .
   # h/o dysphagia - Was evaluated on last admission by speech and swallow
   team.
   - continue soft solids, thin liquids, and medications given whole in
   puree.
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, low sodium, heart healthy diet
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, aggressive bowel regimen, home
   PPI
   .
   # Access: PICC
 will need to evaluate placement with CXR, appears to
   have been placed here the beginning of [**5-28**] PIVs
   .
   # Code: full - reconsult of palliative care team given overall poor
   prognosis
   .
   # Communication: Patient, wife and daughter
   .
   # Disposition: pending titration off CPAP
