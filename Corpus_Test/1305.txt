History of Present Illness:
80 year old female with a past medical history notable for HTN,
a resected acoustic neuroma, and no cardiac history who went to
bathroom and thought she was going to pass out.  She says she
had no strength, and decided to lay down.  She had nausea for an
hour and her Neighbor took her blood pressure which was 110/90.
Concomitantly she had a "chest ache" ([**8-16**]) with a dull L arm
ache.  Concerned for MI, she took asa 81 mg x 4.  Her pain was
non-radiating, non-exertional, and not relieved with rest.  She
then went to the ER for further evaluation.  She reports no
dyspnea,  sick contacts, antecedent illness, long trips, or calf
pain.  She sees her PCP every four months.  On the floor she is
chest pain free.  Her chest pain resolved after receiving
medications at [**Location (un) 614**] (lopressor, nitroglycerin, morphine).
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, and
previous syncope.

ECHO [**10-8**]: EF40%, Mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. In absence of obstructive coronary artery disease,
these findings are most compatible with Takotsubo
cardiomyopathy, although a distal LAD lesion may result in
similar wall motion abnormalities.

CXR [**10-8**]: Ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Massive thoracic scoliosis
with
subsequent asymmetry of the rib cage. Mild overinflation,
increased reticular and vascular structures at the lung bases,
suggesting a combination of potential mild pulmonary fibrosis
and mild pulmonary edema. No evidence of pleural effusions. The
size of the cardiac silhouette is at the upper range of normal.

Cardiac MRI [**2603-10-11**]: Final results pending as of discharge.

Skull XR [**10-11**]: No evidence of shunt displacement.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 year old female who presented to [**Hospital 7954**] hospital with
malaise and substernal chest pain which resolved with
administration of nitro, morphine, lopressor.  Based upon her
ECG, ECHO and cardiac enzymes, the most likely diagnosis was
prior distal LAD MI with recent onset myopericarditis.
.
# Chest Pain: Patient presented with chest pain, elevated
cardiac enzymes, and diffuse ST elevations on EKG. Her chest
pain resolved prior to admission; she had no recurrent symptoms.
Her cardiac catheterization, as described above, showed mild
disease but no occlusions and no intervention was necessary. She
subsequently had a cardiac MRI which showed enhanced gadolinium
uptake (near-transmural) in a coronary distribution (mid LAD),
suggestive of an ischemic etiology for her apical hypokinesis
seen on Echo; the pericardial effusion was stable. It was
thought she had a prior distal LAD territory MI with recent
myopericarditis (enhancement of pericardium and inflammation of
myocardium on cardiac MR). Of note, the final read is not in OMR
at time of discharge but was discussed between attendings. The
final report will be sent to her new cardiologist.  She was
discharged on Aspirin 81 mg daily, statin, beta-blocker, and
ace-inhibitor. She was anticoagulated for prophylaxis of apical
thrombus (and AF).

# Atrial fibrilation: The patient developed afib with RVR 3 days
after admission and spontaneously converted to SR. This was
thought to be due to local irritation secondary to
myopericarditis. She had an additional episode of RVR prior to
dishcarge with conversion to SR after three doses of 5 mg IV
lopressor.  She was asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable
during these episodies.  She was discharged on Metoprolol
Succinate XL 75 mg daily as well as Warfarin 2.5 mg daily with
close follow-up of her INR.

# Hypoxia: CXR showed pulmonary fibrosis and hypertension in the
setting of no history of lung disease. Patient was weaned from
O2 to room air.  Her hypoxia was discussed with her PCP with
plan for an outpatient work up of her disease.

# VP Shunt: Following the patient's cardiac MRI, a skull x-ray
showed the shunt tip to be stable. Neurosurgery was consulted
and the shunt was reprogrammed the day of the MRI.

# HTN: BP remained stable throughout admission and was
maintained on Metoprolol and Enalapril. Patient discharged on
Metoprolol as above and Enalapril Maleate 10 mg daily.

# Cornea transplant, Left eye: Patient maintained on home
Predforte throughout admission.

Patient remained full code throughout admission.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 7958**],
You were admitted to the hospital because you had chest pain and
changes on your heart imaging that were concerning.
You had a cardiac MRI while you were here to further examine
what was causing your pain. This showed an old heart attack and
we think that the chest pain was caused by inflammation of your
heart muscle. This has resolved but we have adjusted your
medicines to prevent another heart attack. You should call Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 7955**] if you have any more chest pain.
.
You also had a very fast irregular heart beat called atrial
fibrillation. We started a long acting beta blocker, Metoprolol,
to control your rhythm. Because atrial fibrillation increases
your risk of a stroke, coumadin was started with a goal INR or
2.0-3.0. You need to have your INR checked on Friday at [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 614**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7955**] will tell you how much coumadin to
take from now on.
.
Please make the following changes to your medications:
1. Start taking a baby aspirin to prevent another heart attack
2. Start taking Metoprolol Succinate to keep your heart rhythm
in normal sinus
3. Start taking coumadin to prevent a stroke.
4. Start taking Simvastatin to prevent and blockages in your
coronary arteries.
.
