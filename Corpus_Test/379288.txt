   Tests
   ECG: (Date: [**2864-2-24**]), sinus rhythm at 64 beats per minute; normal axis
   and intervals. nonspecific ST-T flattening in V5-V6 and T wave
   inversions in I and aVL. Right atrial enlargement.
   Echocardiogram: (Date: [**2864-2-21**]), Regional LV systolic dysfunction
   consistent with multi-vessel CAD or other diffuse process. Diastolic
   dysfunction. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension.  EF 40-45%
   Cardiac Cath: (Date: [**2864-2-19**]), Selective coronary angiography of this
   right dominant system revealed
   nonobstructive left main and 2 vessel obstructive coronary artery
   disease. The LMCA had a 40% stenosis distally, extending into the
   ostium
   of the LAD. The LAD was a large vessel that supplied the apex, and was
   diffusely diseased and calcified. There was a 40% ostial stenosis,
   followed by sequential 70% and 90% stenoses of the proximal and mid
   LAD.
   The LCX was totally occluded, and was collateralized distally by the
   RCA. The RCA had lumenal irregularities up to 30-40% stenosis of the
   proximal and mid vessel, but was otherwise patent.
   Assessment and Plan
   Very long sinus arrest/pause in setting of vasovagal event- She has a
   pronounced cardioinhibitory response. She will likely get a permanent
   pacemaker tomorrow.
   Keep off of nodal blocking agents until PPM is placed.
   Avoid straining with bowel movements.
   Keep NPO past midnight.
   Will discuss assessment and plan with attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6538**]

   ------ Protected Section ------
   Patient was intubated in the setting of hypercarbic respiratory failure
   and received both dopamine and neosynephrine post cardiac
   catheterization on [**2864-2-19**]. She was extubated within 18 hours. The
   atrial fibrillation was following administration of vasopressor agents.
   Also, she smokes 5 cigaretted per day, not per week.

   I have reviewed the data and examined  Pt. .I agree with the need for
   Prophylactic P.Pacer with hysteresis for her Situational Syncopal
   episodes.The Pt understands and wishes to proceed.
