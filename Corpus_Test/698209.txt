   Assessment and Plan
   PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN), .H/O MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
   Assessment and Plan: 83 y.o. M trasferred form OSH last night with
   acute coronary syndrome. Pt was treated at OSH for "COPD exacerbation"
   with steroids and Abx. Pt was also intubated for presumed COPD
   exacerbation, and was able to get extubated successfuly. Here for
   further management (medical vs.surgical).
   Neurologic: Neuro checks Q: 4 hr, Pain controlled
   Cardiovascular: Full anticoagulation, Statins, HD stable.
   Nitroglycerine and heparin drips for management of ACS, but currently
   stable hemodynamically. No evidence of cardiogenic shock. Amlodipine.
   In the process of pre-surgery evaluation; chest CT, carotid u/s.
   Patient is a very high risk surgical candidate. We discussed this with
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] given the severity of COPD and probable inability to
   seperate from vent post-op. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] is evaluating patient for
   surgery.
   Pulmonary: Severe COPD. Inhalers.
   Gastrointestinal / Abdomen: No issues at this point
   Nutrition: NPO
   Renal:
   Hematology: Serial Hct, Stable anemia. Monitor for now. Type and cross
   for 2 units PRBC for potential surgery today
   Endocrine: RISS, Goal BG < 150. Would hold off on steroids for now.
   Infectious Disease: Check cultures, No evidence of infection. Was
   treated for COPD exacerbation at OSH with Z-pack and unasyn. Hold off
   on Abx for now as no evidence of infection
   Lines / Tubes / Drains:
   Wounds:
   Imaging: CT scan chest today, Carotid u/s
   Fluids: KVO
   Consults: CT surgery, P.T.
   Billing Diagnosis: Acute MI / Ischemia
