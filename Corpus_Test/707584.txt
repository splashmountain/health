   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known patient lastname **] is a 76 year old man with multiple medical problems,
   including prosthetic aortic valve and recent MSSA bacteremia,
   presenting with supratherapeutic INR and GI bleeding, in critical
   condition.
   .
   #  GI BLEED: Patient with prior episodes of erosive gastritis and GI
   Bleed, also with known diverticulosis, AAA and history of paroxysmal
   atrial fibrillation. DDx would therefore also include aorto-enteric
   fistula, mesenteric ischemia, ischemic colitis, etc. Given degree of
   bleeding however and excessive anticoagulation for  prosthetic valve
   makes most likely diagnosis mucosal bleed vs diverticular bleed,
   especially in light of unrevealing diagnosis in the past. Highly
   unlikely for such slow bleed to represent aortoenteric fistula.
   No response to 2 units of PRBC and still with melena
   -- Maintain active type and screen, large bore PIV's
   -- Transfuse 3 U PRBC / 2 units FFP
   -- Goal Hct > 25 given severity of CAD
   -- Appreciate GI consult team following
   .
   #  VALVULAR HEART DISEASE / PROSTHETIC VALVE: Patient with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 6097**]
   mechanical valve in aortic position, also with Moderate MR / TR.
   -- If actively bleeding, will need FFP
   -- Avoid Vitamin K to minimize risk of valve thrombosis
   -- Will likely need furosemide with transfusions to avoid pulmonary
   edema in setting of known diastolic heart disease and mitral valve
   regurgitation.
   -- Avoid tachycardia as this will predispose to pulmonary edema.
   .
   #  ENDOCARDITIS, PROSTHETIC VALVE: Patient will require ongoing
   treatment with IV Cefazolin.
   -- Continue cefazolin q8H
   -- Per last ID note, last day [**1-13**]
   .
   #  SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR: Unclear etiology of significantly elevated
   INR, although patient has been on IV antibiotics for a prolonged course
   and has likely erradicated intestinal Vitamin K metabolizers. No other
   clear drug interactions noted.
   -- Hold warfarin
   -- Goal INR 2.5 to 3.5 given mechanical valve at aortic position with
   atrial fibrillation, however given propensity to bleed may require
   tighter goal of near 3.0
   -- FFP PRN for bleeding
   .
   #  DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Appears only mildly volume up, however with
   significant blood loss will hold off on diuresis
   -- As above, avoid tachycardia
   -- Hold diuretics, antihypertensives during acute bleeding.
   .
   #  NECK PAIN: Chronic pain secondary to shingles. patient takes
   oxycodone at home however for now would favor using IV morphine as
   needed for breakthrough pain.
   .
   #. ECG CHANGES: In setting of profound anemia most likely due to demand
   ischemia. Negative troponins on admission, would not continue to trend
   -- ECG in AM.
