Date of Birth:   [**2619-10-4**]       Sex:  M


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 67-year-old male
with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass graft, congestive heart failure,
biventricular failure, ejection fraction 20-30% resulting in
[**2-7**] at a nursing home unresponsive, pulseless and
apneic.  Sick care was initiated, airway was opened and
revealed copious emesis in oropharynx which was suctioned.
Respiratory rate at that time was 1-2 breaths per minute.
Paddles revealed rhythm with PEA at rate of 25-50 beats per
minute.  Peeping was initiated at 70 beats per minute.  He
was intubated in the field and brought promptly to the
He received a total of epinephrine 2 mg, atropine 4 mg.
Arterial blood gas assist control with a rate of 20, tidal
volume 600, PEEP 5, FIO2 100% revealed an arterial blood gas
of 7.28, 47, 77.  He was hypotensive and dopamine was
initiated bring systolic blood pressure up to the 140.  His
baseline is in the 80s.

Laboratories revealed a potassium of 6.9.  He was given
insulin and calcium and a repeat potassium was 6.4.
Electrocardiogram revealed peaked T waves.  Dopamine was
stopped with systolic blood pressure in the 120s, then
propofol was initiated for sedation for ventilation and his
systolic blood pressure decreased to 70.  Dopamine was
restarted, however, patient developed frequent nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia so dopamine was stopped and
Neo-Synephrine was started with resolution of ectopy.
Patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

PEA arrest was felt most likely secondary to hyperkalemia,
however, it is also possible that a primary cardiac event
resulting in tissue necrosis causing a elevated potassium.
Medical Intensive Care Unit course was notable for patient
was initially unresponsive with dilated fixed pupils, but by
hospital day number two, his mental status cleared and
patient was back to baseline.  His vent was weaned and the
patient was extubated.  He was discharged on vancomycin,
levofloxacin and Flagyl to cover for possible aspiration
pneumonia and line infection given an elevated white blood
cell count.  His abdomen was distended and tense, but
baseline, so no studies were pursued.

hematocrit 38.0, platelet count 257,000.  INR 1.5.  Sodium
140, potassium 6.9, chloride 98, BUN 78, creatinine 8.4,

Chest x-ray:  Subcutaneous emphysema on the left.  Increased

HOSPITAL COURSE:

Medical Intensive Care Unit course:  As noted in the history
of present illness, patient was initiated on vancomycin,
levofloxacin, Flagyl antibiotics for presumed aspiration
pneumonia and line infection.  Questionable line was
discontinued and central access was obtained.  He was
continued on Neo-Synephrine until his blood pressure
stabilized to his baseline with systolic blood pressure of
80-90.  He was weaned off the ventilator and was extubated on
[**2-8**].  His neurological improvement was miraculous from
his presentation with dilated fixed pupils to his
conversational alert and oriented status upon discharge.

Hospital course notable for:

1.  CVS:  Dilated cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction
20-30%.  He was not started on a beta-blocker and ACE
inhibitor because of his low systolic blood pressure.

2.  Coronary artery disease:  On enteric coated aspirin.
Laboratories revealed CKs 281, 357, 259, 294, with elevated
MB 16, 17, 26 and 20 with indices 7.1, 7.3, 6.6, 5.4 and
troponins less than 0.3 times four. The elevated CK-MB with
normal troponin was felt most likely secondary to CPR,
however, he does have known coronary artery disease.  Rate
and rhythm:  He was monitored on telemetry and had no events.

3.  Pulmonary:  He was extubated on [**2687-2-8**].  He was
doing well, saturating on room air in the high 90s.  He was
initially noted to have subcutaneous air in the anterior
chest wall and complained of significant right rib pain; felt
to be secondary to a rib fracture from the CPR.  He was given
Tylenol and Toradol for the pain.  He was treated for
presumed aspiration pneumonia given chest x-ray and elevated
white blood cell count with metronidazole 500 mg po q. 8
hours times a seven day course and levofloxacin 500 mg q. 48
hours for seven days.

4.  Renal:  Patient continued to receive hemodialysis for
volume overload.  Calcium acetate was added for an elevated
phosphate.  Hyperkalemia resolved.  He received his final
hemodialysis on the morning of discharge, Saturday, [**2687-2-12**] and will resume his outpatient Monday, Wednesday,
Friday hemodialysis upon discharge.

5.  Infectious Disease:  The patient was initially started on
vancomycin, levofloxacin and Flagyl to cover for both
aspiration pneumonia and femoral line infection given that
femoral line was placed in unsterile conditions.  However,
culture, a central line tip revealed no growth to date so
vancomycin was stopped.  Flagyl and levofloxacin were
continued for a seven day course.  Patient remained afebrile.
Blood cultures showing no growth to date and tip culture
showing no growth to date.

6.  Neurological:  Mental status cleared significantly but
patient still with confusion worse than baseline per his
wife.  [**Name (NI) **] was ordered for Haldol, however, while on the
floor, did not require any for agitation.  He was restarted
on Zoloft 100 mg po q.d. per home regimen.  Narcotics were
avoided given patient's history of confusion with them.

7.  Gastrointestinal:  Patient with ascites secondary to
congestive heart failure.  He has required paracentesis in
the past, however, he is currently without pain and is not
complaining of pain and, therefore, therapeutic tap was felt
to be not useful.

8.  Code status:  Family meeting occurred and patient was
made "Do Not Resuscitate, Do Not Intubate."  He was
discharged to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2687-2-12**] to complete
his course of antibiotics and to continue care.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  PEA arrest.
2.  Hyperkalemia, resolved.
3.  Intubation for respiratory failure.
4.  Aspiration pneumonia.
5.  Dilated cardiomyopathy.
6.  Right rib fracture.
7.  Coronary artery disease.
8.  Abdominal ascites.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to [**Hospital3 **].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Amiodarone 200 mg po q.d.
