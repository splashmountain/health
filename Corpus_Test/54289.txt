Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 5549**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 52**] on [**3-2**] preoperatively for
hemodialysis.  She was taken to the operating room with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**3-4**] and underwent AVR with 21mm St. [**Male First Name (un) **]
mechanical valve and MV repair with 26mm CE annuloplasty band.
Please see operative note for full details.  She was transferred
to the ICU in stable condition and required vasopressors to
maintain adequate blood pressure.  She was significantly volume
overloaded and required several hemodialysis treatments prior to
successful weaning from the ventilator.  She was extubated from
mechanical ventilation on POD#3, and started on heparin for
anticoagulation.  She continued to require lo dose vasopressor
support to maintain an adequate blood pressure.  This was weaned
to off by POD#4, she was started on Lopressor and transferred to
the regular floor on POD#5.  She was noted to have a flexion
deformity of her Left 3rd digit.  The patient reported the night
before her surgery she felt a "[**Doctor Last Name **]" in her finger.  The hand
surgery team surgery was consulted and it was felt that the
patient had a mallet deformity and it was recommended that the
patient have a splint applied to the dorsum of the L third
finger over the DIP joint leaving the PIP joint free.  This was
manufactured by occupational therapy and applied to the
patient's finger.  It was recommended that she follow up with
the hand clinic in 6 weeks.  On POD#6 the patient developed
rapid atrial fibrillation and was treated with IV Lopressor and
amiodarone.  She converted to sinus rhythm shortly after
treatment and had no further atrial fibrillation.  She continued
on heparin and Coumadin and on POD#11, her INR was >2.0 and her
heparin was discontinued and on POD#12, she was cleared for
discharge to home.
