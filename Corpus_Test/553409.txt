   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2840-1-10**], but
   re-intubated [**1-15**] at [**Hospital1 52**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**1-16**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**2-26**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**1-17**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -Continue steroids at prednisone 20 mg PO daily, taper tomorrow to 10
   mg PO daily
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - completed 8 day course of Vancomycin and meropenem
   - sputum cx [**1-17**] no growth
   For Cardiac optimization: Improved BP control. Metabolic alkalosis
   improved with IV diamox, and did have some diuresis with it earlier in
   the day.
   - cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **]
   - diltiazem to 15 QID
   - additional dose of diamox today. Goal -500 to -1 L negative.
   Ventilation:
   - Repeat VBG with SBT today and extubation if passes SBT.
   - IV nitroglycerin during extubation to prevent flash pulmonary edema
   with removal of PPV.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Cre stable at 0.9. Consider starting ACEI once
   extubated and hemodynamically stable.
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable at 28 x3 days.   No EGD only
   evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on admission. No scope
   indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding L upper leg.
   DIC labs negative.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping.
   - consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) if Hct remains
   stable.
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Possible antibiotics related. Stable in 70s.  PF4
   antibodies negative this admission.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - consider restarting anticoagulation for AF.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled  and hemodynamically
   stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed, but has been
   stable in Hct x3 days.
   - diltiazem 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider restarting coumadin tomorrow.
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**1-18**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**1-17**].
   - consider restarting ASA
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2833**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension: improved control (SBPs in 130s) with transient SBPs to
   150s-160s.
   -cont Coreg
   -cont dilt for now
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **].
   - Silvadene 1% cream to coccyx [**Hospital1 **]
   - wound care consulted

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  82 yo F with CAD s/p CABG/AVR c/b L
   diaphragm paralysis, a-fib, COPD on home O2 (chronic CO2 retainer)
   admitted initially to OSH with bradycardia, HOTN, unresponsiveness, ARF
   (atn), GIB and acute on chronic hypercarbic resp failure. Transferred
   to [**Hospital1 52**] for management of GIB.  Course has been c/b thrombocytopenia
   felt [**2-26**] medication (zosyn), failed extubation in setting of flash pulm
   edema and ? aspiration, and hypertension.  Family mtg with code status
   changed to DNR, considering trach, though will continue to
   reassess over next few days for repeat extubation.
   Has tolerated PS wean over 24 hrs.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.1 BP 128/50   HR 84, RR 13-48 (SBT) with sat 98%
   on PS 5/5 (35%)  -->  7.44/61/71
   Eldery F, intubated, awake and alert, slightly more somnolent, distant
   BS, [**Last Name (un) **] HR, dependent edema, diffuse echymosis back, groin and
   thighs--stable.
   Labs notable for WBC 8.5 HCT 28.5, plt 70, cr  0.9, na 147, INR 1.1,
   serum bicarb 39
   CXR
 lines and ETT in position, rotated, slight L vol shift, unchanged
   Primary issues include:
     * Resp failure
         Copd (co2 retention)
         pna
     * arf
     * anemia
         GIB
         Groin hematoma
     * a-fib/bradycardia/sinus pauses
     * thrombocytopenia (from zosyn?, hit neg)
     * hyperglycemia
   Difficult respiratory status with significant underlying copd and pHTN
   confounded by pulm edema and cardiac component with valvular ds,
   tachycardia/afib. Has failed extubation X 2 but is currently doing well
   on weaning trial.
   Agree with plan to repeat ABG/VBG this am.  If adequate, given
   excellent RSBi and improved BP/HR control will move toward extubation.
   Will give nitro and diamox prior to extubation. If fails--pt will need
   trach which we have discussed with family.
        BP and HR are better controlled with dilt and increased coreg
   dose. We continue to hold anticoag given thrombocytopenia and anemia.
   Will continue to taper prednisone, continue MDIs, sx, and pulm toilet.
   Has completed course of vanco/[**Last Name (un) 411**] for pna.
        Renal failure improving --> with good urine.
        Hct stable and suspect multifactorial etiology of anemia with
   probable slow GIB, hematoma, phlebotomy all factors.  GI without plans
   for scope. Continue to guiac stool.  Monitor hematoma on groin and
   back.  Follow h/h, keeping active T and C. IF hct drops again will scan
   for RP bleed (had fem linme at OSH)
        Thrombocytopenia --stable and likely [**2-26**] med effect.  Continue to
   monitor for improvement now off antibx.
        Continue ICU prophylaxis.  Has picc line for access. TFs on hold
   for extubation.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above. Continue to address goals of care.
   DNR.
   Patient is critically ill
   Total time: 40 min
   Addendum:
   Pt failed extubation
developing progressive hypercarbic resp failure.
   Son updated.  Pt reintubated.  Will procede with tracheostomy
   evaluation.
