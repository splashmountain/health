[**3396-7-27**] Endovascular repair of Thoracic aortic aneurysm with a
TAG modular [**Last Name (LF) 26357**], [**First Name3 (LF) 2914**] aortography and Right femoral
artery repair


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 26358**] is an 81 year old female found to have a newly
discovered thoracic aortic aneurysm during preoperative
evaluation for possible D&C for questionable uterine bleeding. A
CT scan in [**3396-3-16**] revealed two areas of fusiform aneurysmal
dilatation of descending thoracic aorta up to 6.6 centimeters.
The CT scan was also notable for an infrarenal abdominal aortic
aneurysm, measuring 6.7 centimeters. Given the above results,
she was referred to the cardiac and vascular services for
endovascular stent grafting. Of note, the etiology of her
bleeding turned out to be hemorrhoids, not uterine.

Brief Hospital Course:
On the day of admission, Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 19576**] performed
an endovascular repair of her thoracic aortic aneurysm.
Arteriography following stent placement revealed no endo leak at
the proximal attachment site, with a small endo leak seen at the
distal attachment site. The endo leak did not appear to
communicate with the aneurysm sac. The operation was otherwise
uneventful and there were no complications. She was brought to
the CSRU for invasive monitoring. On postoperative day one, she
experienced hypotension. Subsequent CT scan showed a moderate
amount retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Serial hematocrits remained
stable and she transiently required pressors for hemodynamic
support. Over the next 24 hours, her hemodynamics improved and
she successfully weaned from pressors without difficulty. She
was extubated without incident and the lumbar drain was removed
without complication. She made clinical improvements and
transferred to the SDU on postoperative day two. She was
intermittently transfused to maintain hematocrit near 30%. She
maintained stable hemodynamics and tolerated resumption of beta
blockade. She remained in a normal sinus rhythm. She had a
transient decline in renal function with creatinine peaking to
1.8 but by discharge, her renal function improved. Creatinine at
discharge was 1.5. Prior to discharge, a chest CTA was obtained
to re-evaluate the small endo leak at the distal attachement
site. The CTA was reviewed by both the vascular and cardiac
surgery services and it was determined that intervention was not
required at this time.  She was discharged in stable condition
to home.
