   Assessment and Plan
   60M with h/o ESLD due to EtOH cirrhosis now presents with acute onset
   altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy
   .
   #.  AMS - DDx includes hepatic encephalopathy, ingestion, CVA,
   toxic-metabolic abnormalities. Given current presentation and elevated
   ammonia, most likely hepatic encephalopathy.  Ultrasound finding of new
   portal vein thrombus.  No SPB based on ascites, urine and serum tox
   negative.
   -- lactulose 30cc q3h via NGT for PSE + enema.
   -- rifaximin 400mg tid
   -- no e/o PNA on CXR, but will panculture to r/o other sources of
   infection as precipitants
   -- Blood and ascites cxs negative to date
   -- CIWA scale
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - appears secondary to AMS
   -- wean down FiO2, change to PSV as tolerated, check ABGs prn
   -- titrate downs sedation as MS clears
   -- HOB elevation, VAP care/mouth hygiene
   -- will likely extubate today after CT-Abd/pelvis
   .
   #. ESLD - undergoing liver transplant evaluation
   -- lactulose/rifaximin
   -- trend LFTs
   -- MELD score 28
   -- surgery recs: to hydrate, f/u on ascites cx, and CT-Abd+ IV con, to
   eval for portal thrombus extent.
   -- Liver recs:  ?IgA nephropathy, challenge w/ 1g/kg Albumin.
   .
   # CRI - appears at his baseline
   -- trend creatinine
   -- renally dose meds
   .
   # Depression -
   -- continue sertraline
   .
   #. FEN - NPO for now, low Na diet when extubated
