   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old man with recent aortic aneurysm repair ([**1-/3480**]),
   complicated by ischemic bowel and sepsis with subsequent wound
   dehiscence, also with h/o CAD s/p CABG who is transferred from the
   medical floor for hypoxia and hypercapnia.
   # Hypoxic/Hypercarbic respiratory failure: with severe hypercapnia and
   significant respiratory acidosis requiring intubation at presentation.
   [**Month (only) 47**] be secondary to an acute on chronic process with hypoxic
   respiratory failure secondary to pleural effusions and compressive
   atelectasis, and hypercapnic respiratory failure with question of
   diaphragmatic weakness vs midbrain lesion. Also likely contribution
   from medical-related mental status changes (was on remeron) and
   abdominal wounds.  Off vancomycin, pip-tazo ([**Date range (1) 7814**]) given negative
   cultures to date.
   - ventilatory support: wean sedation as tolerated, SBP
   - plan for EMG study today by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1592**]
   - f/u bronch studies
   - f/u blood culture, sputum cx
   - Pleural effusion too small for [**Female First Name (un) 208**]
   # Hypotension: BP in 70s episodically with baseline in 90-100, likely
   in the setting of high PEEP (15), but has now resolved.  Baseline BP is
   SBP in 90s.  Concern for sepsis is low.
   - IVF as needed for MAP>60
   - s/p 1 pRBC transfusion
   # Leukocytosis:  improving, blood/sputum/stool/urine cx ngtd. Off
   vanc/zosyn [**6-7**]
   - monitor
   # Anuric renal failure: U/O at 20 cc/hr. Cre 2.9 from 2.4 yesterday.
   Thought to be [**2-9**] contrast nephropathy post CTA. Ddx includes
   hypovolemia/prerenal (supported by FeNa<1) vs ATN (in setting of
   hypoTN). Urine eos negative; U/A notable for 59 RBC and 19 WBC. Renal
   u/s without hydronephrosis.
   - F/u renal recs
   - Repeat U/A
   # CAD: ECG unchanged from prior. CABG in [**3463**]. Multiple PCI. No active
   issues or complaints.  ECHO with LVEF of 40%, global hypokinesis. Trop
   elevation likely in setting of renal failure; CK flat.
   - continue aspirin, statin
   - restart low-dose metoprolol given PVCs, hemodynamic stability
   # Recent AAA repair, colectomy, wound infections: being followed by
   surgery. Off vanc/zosyn as above.
   - f/u surgery recs
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue statin.
   # HTN:
   - restarted low-dose metoprolol with stable BP
   # Cervical Myelopathy: Baseline. Continue pain control

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   79-year-old man with recent aortic aneurysm repair ([**1-/3480**]),
   complicated by ischemic bowel and sepsis with subsequent wound
   dehiscence, also with h/o CAD s/p CABG. Echo demonstrates LV
   hypokinesis, pulm regurg, normal RV. Self-extubated [**6-6**]- failed in
   less than 1 hour due to resp failure with hypercapnia, hypopnea.
   Events
   Large volume purulent drainage of previously well-appearing left flank
   surgical wound.
   Exam: sedated, appears uncomforable with exam. PERRL, cta anterior,
   RRR, hypoactive BS. Left flank wound draining large volume purulent
   brown fluid. Area around wound indurated, tender. trace edema. no
   rashes or joint inflammation.
   Meds: hep sc, fent and versed bolus (approx 25mcg and 1mg q 2 hr,
   respectively), prevacid, mvi, zosyn d7.
   Data
   WBC decreased to 13, bicarb 16, AG 13, hyperchloremic met acidosis
   Cr 2.9 (rising from 1.3 [**6-4**]). Muddy brown casts on urine. Renal USG
   unremarkable.
   KEY ISSUES:
   1.       Resp failure. Multifactorial, due to pleural effusions,
   atelectasis, weakness, malnutrition.
          Wean PEEP and repeat SBT if appropriate. Extubation seems
   unlikely since we have not reversed underlying processes, and now
   compounded by metabolic NAG acidosis.
          Neuromuscular fellow, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1592**], to address possible
   component of diaphragmatic dysfunction or brain stem component to
   breathing pattern- EMG planned for today
   2.       Wound abscess. Cx pending. Starting vanc/zosyn. (Had been on
   vanc/zosyn [**6-1**]- [**6-7**] but stopped yesterday as BAL cx neg, no clear
   source of infection.) WBC 12--> 19--> 13. Rectal exam to evaluate
   purulent drainage from rectum as well. Vascular surgery aware.
   3.       Pleural effusions: albumin 2.4, cardiomyopathy with EF 40%.
   Optimize heart failure regimen.
   4.       ARF: contrast nephropathy, ATN. Renal USG showed no hydro. No
   indication for dialysis now.
   5.       Hypotension, near baseline, with h/o severe vasculopathy.
   6.       Sedation with fent/versed boluses
   Total time spent:  45 minutes.
   Patient is critically ill.
   Addendum: family meeting.
   Met with pt
s wife to discuss current status and answer all questions
   in detail.

   Family meeting:
   Met with pt
s wife as well as Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 81**] [**Name (NI) 7821**], family friend, to
   discuss very poor prognosis, multifactorial resp failure with profound
   weakness and malnutrition. I asked her to think about whether he would
   want to live for a long period on life support, and discuss it with her
   children, particularly if his outcome is uncertain and may include a
   poor functional status. I explained that he would not be able to
   tolerate any further complications and that cardiac resuscitation would
   be futile in his current state. She agreed to make him DNR. I told her
   I hope that his sedation is less over the next days so she might be
   able to discuss these issues directly with him.
