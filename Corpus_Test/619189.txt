   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**3068-5-24**]
   - Coughed up ~10ccs [**Known patient firstname **] red blood at 11pm.  Morning [**5-25**] coughing up
   small amount dark brown substance.  Larger amount aspirated from NG
   Tube  ? swallowed blood.
   .
   - CT Head obtained, preliminary read:  bilateral basal ganglion
   hypodensity concerning for acute infarction (confirmed with Radiology
   Fellow), bilateral involvement consistent with anoxic event, atleast
   3-4 hours post event; MRI would be helpful if patient stable
   - Given 2L D5 with 150mEq bicarbonate with only minimal improvement in
   urine output; able to wean dopamine significantly but patient became
   bradycardic with complete discontinuation
   - DNR status confirmed with family
   .
   - Thoracic Surgery consulted to manage chest tube, though appears port
   in chest wall, reportedly fine without air-leak; continue as we are
   - Neurology contact, will have formal consult on [**Name (NI) 486**] s/p re-warming
   but recommended EEG in interim
   - A-line placed for improved BP monitoring and weaning of pressors

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with h/o CABG 7 yrs ago, s/p [**Hospital3 **] ICD (5yrs ago), afib on
   coumadin, COPD presented with acute episode respiratory distress, PEA
   arrest s/p CPR/ACLS and now on pressors and cooling protocol.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial PEA
   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.  Now s/p  cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6
   hours warming (unclear start time per outside hospital records, given
   EMS records, will presume 0200, so cooled until [**3058**]).  Now rewarmed.
   - Q8H lytes now that pt has been rewarmed
   - cardiac arrest team involved, appreciate recs
   - wean down on pressors, starting with dopamine, keeping MAP>60
   - order for continuous 48hr bedside EEG per protocol
   - Formal Neuro consult this AM, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2156**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; will have formal
   consultation and recs RE: prognosis & clinical outcomes
   - SW consult for family coping
   - Pt enrolled in steroid clinical trial
   - Family meeting this morning
   .
   # Respiratory failure: s/p intubation initially difficult to ventilate
   with high auto PEEP, PIP.   Patient with h/o asthma and concern for
   bronchospasm on exam.  No h/o COPD per available records.  Improved
   with aggressive broncodilator therapy.
   - repeat CXR
   - Will move ETT down 3cm and repeat CXR afterwards
   - Adjust mech vent settings (? Increase TV)
   - Schedule Albuterol / Ipratroprium  &  PRN Albuterol
   .
   # CORONARIES: h/o CAD s/p CABG (unknown anatomy). No localized ischemia
   on ECGs, cardiac enzymes elevated but s/p compressions, however cannot
   exclude ischemic event
   - enzymes trending down, will recheck as needed
 none for now
   - Repeat EKG this AM and another tomorrow AM
   .
   # PUMP: EF 25% [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 74**] [**3067-4-21**] ETT.
   - order for TTE, can get emergently if any hemodynamic
   compromise/evidence of acute ischemia
   .
   # RHYTHM: V-paced, pacer interrogated showing oversensitivity leading
   to 2 episodes of inappropriate ICD firing at OSH, none since. Patient
   therapeutic on prior coumadin.  Discontinued Amiodarone gtt upon
   arrival to CCU.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - history of chronic atrial fibrillation; now with changing rhythm on
   telemetry, some AVIR
   .
   # s/p R chest tube for small R apical pneumothorax; now with some
   oozing.  Thoracics following.
   - CXR with side port in chest wall, fine by Thoracics unless develops
   airleak
   - repeat CXR; obtain daily CXR
   - follow chest tube output
   - monitor Hct as chest tube output bloody
   .
   # Asthma: Patient with reported h/o asthma, bronchospastic on exam.
   - aggressive standing neb treatment
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Baseline 1.2.  Likely some component of ATN
   given s/p PEA arrest x 2.  UOP poor.
   - Monitor uop / Cr
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis / Metabolic Acidosis: Patient with mixed acid
   [**Last Name 3231**] problem.  Lactic acidosis.  Also with h/o COPD.
   - Ventilator management with increased Vt
   - Will move ETT down 3cm and repeat CXR afterwards
   - Adjust mech vent settings (? Increase TV) to compensate for
   respiratory acidosis
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO; will start PPI and guaiac gastric contents

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   per housestaff
   nothing to add
   Physical Examination
   per housestaff
   nothing to add
   Medical Decision Making
   per housestaff
   nothing to add
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 21**] or health care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   no improvement other than some mild eeg improvement
   hemodynamically less stable - now requiring pressors for hypotension
   no arrhythmias
   continue supportive care including antibiotics and vasopressors
   if no meaningful neurological improvement will discuss withdrawal of
   care - have discussed this plan extensively with wife and son
