   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old man with history of DM, hypertension, status post CABG
   complicated by CVA and subglottic stenosis (after multiple
   intubations), CHF with the EF of 35%-40%, who presented to the ED with
   shortness of breath & stridor and was found to have a fluid collection
   in anterior neck s/p tracheal dilation two days prior as well as
   possible multi-focal PNA on CXR
   # Airway compromise/Anterior Neck Collection: H/o subglottic stenosis
   s/p multiple intubations.  Has h/o stridor.  Underwent tracheal
   dilation at Mass Eye & Ear on [**9-12**] w/ Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3004**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4246**].  Suspect acute
   compromise in airway is related to procedure; however, no clear
   findings on fiberoptic imaging while intubating.  Per ENT, pt's sridor
   could be rebound subglottic swelling from recent procedure, however
   this usually doesn't happen in this time frame.  Anterior neck
   collection may be related to airway compromise given its size.  Again,
   suspect that this collection is related to recent procedure.  [**Month (only) 56**] be
   early infectious collection vs. edema.  On exam neck is more swollen,
   tender
   - swelling discussed with ENT, obtained neck u/s with goal to drain any
   fluid collection, discussed with radiology who saw only small shallow
   11mm collection, did not look like abscess and was not amenable to
   draining, recommend following clinically and repeating u/s in [**2-3**] days
   to assess for evolving collection with possible future drainage.
   - Continue to treat with clinda and unasyn for 14 day course.
   - Discussed steroids with ENT team, no indication to continue high dose
   steroids.  Unclear indication for baseline 10mg daily prednisone pt is
   on.  Will plan to discuss with him and wife to determine why he is on
   these and to potentially begin tapering them if indication is not
   clear.
   - Monitor neck for increasing size of mass
   - ENT following, f/u daily recs.  Pt
s surgeon at [**Hospital 3345**] Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 4246**] is aware he is here.
   # Fevers: Has been having low grade temps, past 24 hour max 100.2,
   slightly elevated WBC. Elevated WBC could be in setting of steroid use.
   -unlikely pt has PNA in absence of symptoms, significant CXR findings
   and negative BAL.
   -will d/c empiric Vanc/Zosyn.
   -Continue to treat potential neck infection with clinda/unasyn as above
   -plan to repeat u/s in [**2-3**] days if neck swelling persists to look for
   fluid collection.
   # CAD: s/p 5 vessel CABG.  CE negative x2 since presentation.  No CP.
   - Restarted coreg, aspirin, will resume statin as well
   # CHF/Cardiomyopathy: last TTE in [**8-9**] w/ EF 35-40%.
   - restart lasix
   - Carvedilol, spironolactone, lisinopril
   #Afib/CVA: in sinus at present. Rate 70s. INR 1.4.  Coumadin had been
   on hold peri-procedure (trach dilation).
   - holding Coumadin for possible procedure, restart as soon as possible.
   Ok
d with ENT.
   - on decreased dose of Carvedilol
   # H/o postoperative polymorphic VT: has not received mexilitine x 6
   days.  No episodes VT. Discussed with pt
s outpatient cardiologist Dr
   [**First Name (STitle) 37**] and [**Doctor Last Name 4203**] who agree that mexilitine may be stopped.
   #DM II: RISS plus lantus (will increase lantus dose to home dose of 32u
   QHS)
