History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6097**] is a 72 y/o man with a three year history of MR
followed by serial echocardiograms at the [**Hospital6 6098**]. A
recent echocardiogram in [**Month (only) 528**] revealed severe MR with a
flail posterior leaflet. He was admitted to the VA and underwent
a TEE which was stopped due to NSVT vs. SVT. Cardiac
catheterization  in [**2748-1-4**] confirmed 4+ MR. Angiography
revealed a 70% lesion in the circumflex and a 50% lesion in the
LAD. Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6097**] was seen in clinic and now presents for surgical
management of his coronary artery disease and mitral
regurgitation.

Past Medical History:

History of severe nose bleeds, Lipoma, s/p Appendectomy, s/p
Tonsillectomy, s/p Umbilical Hernia repair

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6097**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 22**] on [**2748-3-8**] for surgical
management of his mitral valve and coronary artery disease. On
the day of admission, he was taken to the operating room where a
mitral valve replacement, coronary artery bypass grafting and a
MAZE procedure were performed. The operation was uneventful but
his operative course was complicated by traumatic foley
placement secondary to his BPH. For surgical details, please see
seperate operative note. He required flexibile cystoscopy for
placement of foley and was started on a [**Doctor Last Name **] drip for
hematuria. After the operation, he was brought to the CSRU for
invasive monitoring. Given his history of SVT and Maze
procedure, Amiodarone was resumed. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. Initially hypoxic, his
oxygenation improved with diuresis. On postoperative day two, he
transferred to the SDU. Low dose beta blockade was resumed and
diuresis was continued. On postoperative day five, he
experienced new onset slurred speech and left facial droop. His
systolic BP at the time of neurologic event was in the 90's to
low 100's. A stat head CT scan and MRI/MRA were obtained and the
neurology service was consulted. Head MR found no evidence of
acute infarction or abnormalities except slightly diminished
flow signal within the right Sylvian middle cerebral artery
branches compared to the left side,  while CT scan showed no
intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Carotid noninvasive
studies found no evidence of significant carotid stenoses and
showed appropriate antegrade flow in the vertebral arteries. All
afterload agents were temporarily discontinued including
Amiodarone in order to maintain cerebral perfusion and avoid
further hypotension. Warfarin anticoagulation was also
initiated. Based on the above studies, the neurology service
suspected a TIA secondary to decreased cerebral perfusion. His
neurological status improved and returned to baseline within 24
hours. Amiodarone and low dose betablockade were eventually
resumed. Warfarin was dosed daily for a goal INR between 2.0 -
2.5. He remained mostly in a normal sinus rhythm but
intermittent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation versus SVT were
noted on telemetry. The rest of his hospital course was
uneventful and he was medically cleared for discharge to home on
postoperative day eight. At discharge, his BP was 117/55 with a
HR of 84. His oxygen sat was 98% on room air and his chest x-ray
showed small bilateral pleural effusions. All surgical wounds
were clean, dry and intact. He was voiding without difficulty
and his hematuria had completely resolved. He will eventually
need to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient for
diagnostic EP study in the near future.
