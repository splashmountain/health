   Fluid analysis / Other labs: U/A with mod bact, [**4-4**] WBC.
   Serum and urine tox screens negative.
   Imaging: CXR: The ET tube has its tip approximately 45 mm from the
   carina. The NG tube has its tip projected over the stomach. There is
   apparent cardiomegaly which may partly be due to AP projection. The
   lungs are clear.
   .
   CT head: There is no evidence for edema, hemorrhage, mass effect, or
   territorial infarction. There is no shift of midline, and there is
   preservation of the normal [**Doctor Last Name 707**]-white matter differentiation. The
   ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber and configuration. There are
   no fractures. There is mucosal thickening of the left and right
   maxillary sinuses as well as the ethmoid sinuses and nasal passages,
   which could be related to patient's intubated status. Patient is status
   post right lens surgery. There are extensive vascular calcifications of
   the carotid and vertebral arteries. IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial
   process.
   Microbiology: Blood and urine cultures pending
   ECG: ECG: Sinus, 60bpm, LAD, no acute ST changes
   Assessment and Plan
   45M h/o diabetes, ?renal disease, ?seizure found unresponsive at home.
   .
   # Unresponsive: Most likely severe hypoglycemia, unclear what
   outpatient medications patient is on (?sulfonurea, insulin) but
   possibly renal failure could have been precipitant. Consider seizure
   (perhaps in setting of hypoglycemia) or infectious source (CNS or
   otherwise). Tox screens negative. Consider cardiac event as evidence
   vascular disease on CT head and diabetic, also with mildly elevated CK
   and TnT but which could be explained by immobilization and renal
   failure, respectively.
   - Continue rewarming
   - Q1H fingersticks
   - Vanc/CTX given in ED
   - f/u culture results
   - Check TSH, B12, RPR
   - EEG to r/o seizure
   - Consider LP and MR brain
   - Continue propofol gtt
   - Consider neuro consult should MS not improve
   - ROMI with serial enzymes
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection. Likely
   hypoventilating based on pre-intubation ABG. Wean vent as MS improves,
   may be able to relatively rapidly extubate if MS recovers with
   euglycemia and rewarming. ?airway edema and no cuff leak per
   respiratory. Allow to diurese overnight and revisit extubation in AM.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: ?Chronic renal disease. Cre 6.5 on admission
   with no baseline. UOP ~1L in the ED. ?obstruction due to prostate,
   bladder stone, mass, other. No acute dialysis need based on lytes and
   seems to be making urine. [**Month (only) 56**] have been down for some time so monitor
   for rhabdo although CK not significantly elevated at present.
   - Foley
   - Urine lytes, eos
   - Renal ultrasound
   - Follow UOP closely
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Consider renal consult
   .
   # Edema: Likely due to renal failure, although consider cardiogenic
   source and CXR read as clear although appears to have increased
   interstitial markings possibly consistent with CHF. Also consider
   anaphylactic type reaction however would be less consistent with
   presentation of hypoglycemia and hypothermia. Appears to be oxygenating
   well. Check cuff leak and consider ENT to eval airway prior to
   extubation. Appears to be autodiuresing, follow UOP.
   .
   # Diabetes: FS Q1h. Hold anti-hyperglycemic agents.
   .
   # ?Seizure history: Workup per above, attempt to contact family or
   physicians for past medical history.
   .
   # Anemia: Unclear baseline, currently ~25. If h/o renal failure could
   explain chronic anemia. No evidence of active bleeding presently.
   - Repeat Hct for stability
   - Guaiac all stools
   - 2x PIV, T&S
