   Assessment and Plan
   62M PMH CAD s/p CABG, DM2, HTN, CRF (baseline Cr 2.0), depression with
   past suicide attempt presenting with altered mental status.
   # Altered Mental Status: Unclear etiology and broad differential.
   Neurologic exam is nonfocal with somewhat improved mental status from
   presentation, now answering simple questions.  Low-grade temperature
   and leukocytosis suggest infection, although stress response is also
   possible.  Most likely etiology of infection would be intra-abdominal
   process versus cellulitis
 chest x-ray, urinalysis negative.  Unlikely
   to be meningitis.  Medication overdose also likely, intentional or
   unintentional
 tox screens positive for tricyclics, otherwise
   unrevealing.  Uremia and metabolic derangements contributing.  Patient
   is hyperglycemic but there is no indication of ketoacidosis or HONK.
   Calcium, liver function tests normal.
   - Continue vancomycin and start zosyn for now for empiric coverage of
   skin and abdominal pathogens
   - CT head and torso without contrast
   - Toxicology curbside
 monitor EKG for QRS widening which would
   suggest tricyclic overdose
   - Supportive care for metabolic derangements
   - Hold all sedating medications
   - NPO for now
   - Unclear medication regimen; will clarify regimen with home pharmacy
   in the morning
   - Continue to monitor
   - Consider HIV test when patient able to consent
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline creatinine is 2.0 and was
   4.0 on admission.  A Foley was placed and patient drained 1.7L.  Could
   represent post-obstructive physiology given history of BPH.  Urine
   electrolytes not indicative of a prerenal etiology.  Hyperkalemic on
   presentation but not hyperphosphatemic.
   - CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Urine eosinophils pending
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Treatment for hyperkalemia as needed
   - Continue to trend
   - Consider renal consult in the morning if no improvement
   # Acid base status: Patient has primary respiratory alkalosis with
   non-gap metabolic acidosis of unclear etiology.  Consider CNS lesion or
   medications for respiratory alkalosis
 unlikely hepatic failure or
   sepsis.  Most likely etiology of metabolic acidosis is early renal
   disease versus ingestion versus intra-abdominal process; no history of
   diarrhea.
   - D5 with 3 amps bicarbonate x 1 L
   - CT head and torso without contrast
   - Monitor closely
   # Left shoulder lesion:  Unclear etiology
 per patient
s partner,
   there is no history of trauma and the lesion has been progressively
   worsening over weeks.  He also has a number of smaller crusted popular
   lesions on his left arm.
   - Consider dermatology consult for further evaluation
   - Wound care
   # Elevated lipase: Normal amylase.  [**Month (only) 56**] be elevated in the setting of
   acute renal failure.  The patient does not clinically have
   pancreatitis.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Tachycardia: Mild, sinus.  Unclear etiology
 likely due to agitation
   versus volume depletion.  Afebrile, not in pain.  Hematocrit stable.
   - Fluids as above
   - Monitor
   # Type 2 diabetes: Currently not controlled.
   - Insulin gtt overnight
   #Hyperkalemia: In the setting of ARF.  No EKG changes.
   - Patient received kayexalate in the ED
   - Monitor
   # Coagulopathy: Unclear etiology
 likely due to nutritional deficiency
   since low albumin as well.  No signs or symptoms of active bleeding.
   - Consider vitamin K PO if mental status improves
   # Anemia: Microcytic, improved from previous baseline in our system
   after CABG.  No signs or symptoms of active bleeding.
   - Iron studies
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Monitor
   # Coronary artery disease: Status post CABG in [**3420**].  No ischemic
   changes on EKG.
   - Will give metoprolol IV overnight
   - Consider rectal aspirin in the morning if mental status not improved
   - Unclear regimen; will clarify regimen with home pharmacy in the
   morning
   # Hypertension: Currently hypertensive.  Unclear home regimen.
   - Metoprolol 10 mg IV Q6H
   - Will clarify regimen with home pharmacy in the morning
   # Depression: Unclear home regimen.
   - Would hold all medications in the setting of altered mental status,
   but will clarify regimen with home pharmacy in the morning
