   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 87 y/o male with cardiac history as well as squamous
   cell CA on face, admitted with SOB/DOE x 3 days w/ pink frothy sputum
   production and white out of left lung.
   .
   #. SHORTNESS OF BREATH: Patient with unilateral pulmonary infiltrate.
   Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though appears to have
   element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most likely, and
   would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which whole lung is
   affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four days ago at
   PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of hemotpysis, making
   mass and PE a possibility (especially with the hypoxia).  S/p
   thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to show loculated
   pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no pleural effusion
   or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular hypokinesis.  IP
   evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated pleural effusion,
   which the patient refused.  Re-evaluation of the CT while awaiting
   final read appears as though patient has dense, possibly
   post-obstructive pneumonia. Patient was initially on
   Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric treatment of CAP, but this was d/c
   [**11-6**] and patient was started on Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When patient
   becomes anxious, SpO2 decreases.
   -- Continue Vanc/Cefepime for HAP and azithromycin to cover atypicals
   -- f/u blood cultures, sputum cultures
   -- Given [**Hospital1 **]-v hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic
   dysfunction, monitor fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not
   go into flash pulmonary edema
   -- can repeat 20 IV lasix again today, goal -500cc today, given CXR,
   wheeze (?cardiac wheeze), pedal edema
   -- morphine for SOB and anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- consider haldol for anxiety (as anxiety was trigger for hypoxia)
   -- CPAP as needed
   -- daily CXR
   -- cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- nebs standing and prn (but cautious use of albuterol given
   tachycardia)
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with RVR.  Consider HF as a trigger given significant
   pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p diltiazem gtt for rate control.
   -- Change IV to PO metoprolol (metoprolol 50mg tid) as taking PO
   without difficulty now
   -- Lasix this AM, as above
   -- Not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.
   -- Continue ASA 325mg daily
   .
   #. Systolic and likely diastolic HF:  Given BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 10874**], weight gain,
   pitting edema b/l, and elevated Cr, patient appears he is in acute on
   chronic HF, though fluid status is difficult to assess in this
   patient.  Given patient
s age and tenuous health, hold Lasix diuresis
   today and instead attempt to rate control a fib with RVR to increase
   forward flow and promote auto-diuresis.
   - Lasix as above, diuresis
   - Monitor I/O to ensure patient does not go into fluid overload & go
   into flash pulmonary edema
   - Morphine PRN as above
   .
   # Agitation: Patient agitated when SpO2 decreases.
   - Consider haldol as needed for agitation as that was previously
   related to desats
   - Reorient frequently
   .
   # Disorientation: Patient, while hypoxic, felt vertical while was
   horizontal in bed. Consider hypoxic cerebral hypoperfusion, verus
   embolic phenomenom d/t afib without anticoagulation. Symptoms resolved
   now with improved SpO2.
   - Reorient
   - If clinical picture changes, consider CT head
   .
   # End of life care:
   - Palliative care c/s placed, f/u recs
   .
   #. DIABETES:
   -- will hold home PO meds; on SSI
   .
   # FEN:  Regular diet
   .
   #. PPX: home PPI, SQH, bowel regimen
 goal BM today
   .
   #. CONTACT: with patient, had friends who are [**Name (NI) 10876**] ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 15**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 464**] and
   [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10877**])
 they were updated yesterday ([**11-7**])
   .
   #. CODE: DNR/DNI.
   #. DISPO: in ICU, pending clinical improvement.
