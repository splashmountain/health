Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 835**]
Chief Complaint:
"Ventricular tachycardia with 3 shocks".

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia ablation
2. Thyroidectomy


History of Present Illness:
77 yr old pt with hx of large anterior wall infarct in [**3130**],
cardiac arrest [**3139**], s/p AICD, treated with Amiodarone over last
several years for VT. He is s/p upgrade to BIV ICD in [**3150**] and
s/p VT ablation at CMC several years ago and again this summer.
This summer, his amiodarone had to be stopped after he became
hyperthyroid. He was treated with steroids and Tapozole, however
free T4 is still 1.78, and TSH is 0.133. As a result, he has
been on Mexilitine since the summer. He presented this weekend
to St. [**Hospital 796**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 300**], NH after being shocked by
his AICD three times on [**Holiday 3759**]. The patient reports he
"felt different as if he might pass out" for a fleeting second.
He also notes lightheadedness right before his first shock. He
felt normal for 2 seconds, and then received two subsequent
shocks. He denies feeling chest pain or shortness of breath at
that time. He went to St. Josephs Hospital in [**Location (un) 300**]. At that
point, he was restarted on PO amiodarone. Since restarting
amiodarone, he has been stable with no recurrent episodes of VT.
He is currently on telemetry for monitoring. He is being
transferred for further management of VT, and evaluation for
possible VT Ablation. Also, of note the patient is on warfarin
for Low EF.
.
ROS: + BPH like symptoms
- He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. He sleeps on
two pillows at night.

pneumonia versus loculated pleural effusion versus pleural or

Right-sided pleural effusion.

[**3153-12-21**] CXR: 1. Stable opacification in the right lower lobe
likely represents loculated pleural effusion, but pneumonia or
mass cannot be excluded. CT is recommended for further
evaluation. 2. Stable free small right pleural effusion.

[**3153-12-21**] UENI: Nonocclusive thrombus expanding the basilic vein
of the right upper extremity. Patent deep venous system in the
right upper
extremity.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo male history of old anterior wall infarct, multiple
cardiac arrests s/p ICD, ischemic cardiomyopathy last EF 22% on
warfarin, hyperthyroidism [**2-17**] amio toxicity, stage 3 CKD and two
prior VT ablations admitted after three ICD shocks on
[**Holiday 3759**], now s/p VT ablation and thyroidectomy, back on
amiodarone.

#VT: Transferred from OSH for VT ablation.  Amiodarone started
at OSH, but stopped upon admission to [**Hospital1 4**] given possible VT
ablation.  Patient underwent VT mapping and ablation, during
which he was put on dopamine and neosynephrine.  He quickly
weaned off of these pressors and was extubated.   He was
transferred to the CCU for observation overnight.  He came back
to the medical floor the next morning.  He had further episodes
of VT the next day, the longest of which was 9 beats.  Inpatient
endocrinology was consulted and it was decided to proceed to
thyroidectomy after discussion of VT management with cardiology.
He continued to have runs of VT, but was able to be paced out of
them by his pacemaker.  He was restarted on amiodarone 200mg PO
TID x1month after thyroidectomy.  He will then transition down
to 300mg PO daily.  An appointment was made for him to follow up
with his outpatient cardiologist.

#Hyperthyroidism:  This is most likely secondary to amiodarone
toxicity, but not known if it is destructive thyroiditis or
autonomy.  Initially, this was thought to be conducive to
medical manangement.  As a diagnostic trial, his prednisone was
quickly tapered to 5mg daily for five days, and his methimazole
was increased to 20mg twice daily.  However, it became clear
that he needed thyroidectomy sooner than later given the
incidence of VT.  He underwent thyroidectomy without
complication.   Stress dose hydrocortisone was given prior to
surgery to avoid adrenal insufficiency.  It is possible that a
parathyroid gland was taken upon removal of the thyroid gland,
so calcium was monitored every 12 hours thereafter.  He was sent
home on calcium carbonate 1000mg daily and instructed to call
with any symptoms of hypocalcemia.  Synthroid was started at a
50mcg dose given recurrent VT.  Oxycodone was given for pain
control.

#LV aneurysm:  His INR was 1.6 prior to thyroidectomy so he was
maintained on a heparin drip until the day of surgery.  He was
continued on warfarin after surgery.  His dose was increased to
3mg daily given concommitant use of amiodarone.  He was
instructed to have his INR checked one week after discharge and
to follow this up with his cardiologist.

#Diabetes:  His sugars have been elevated during his prednisone
use.  He was maintained on his outpatient sliding scale, which
was initially 1:7 carb count.  This was titrated down to 1:5
when his prednisone was tapered down to 5mg daily.

#Right pleural effusion and mass: Noted on multiple chest xrays
during admission.  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 1444**] notes this was previously worked
up with biopsy and serial CT scans but they stopped surveillance
four years ago.  His PCP was notified of the persistent finding,
and a repeat CT scan was suggested for comparison.

#CORONARIES: He has a history of large anterior wall infarct
complicated by ischemic cardiomyopathy.  He did not have chest
pain or shortness of breath during admission.  He was maintained
on medical management of aspirin, carvedilol, and  valsartan.
His Crestor was increased to 20mg daily.  He will need need
repeat LFT's in 6 weeks.

#PUMP: Ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 22% on last Echo [**3147**] per
OSH records.  He was euvolemic on exam.   He was continued on
medical management with spironolactone, furosemide, carvedilol,
and warfarin.

#Left arm swelling:  An upper extremity ultrasound on the day of
discharge revealed a superficial vein thrombus. He was
recommended to use warm compresses.

#STAGE 3 CKD: His creatinine was at baseline 1.5.

#Anemia: Likely combination of iron deficiency, B12 deficiency,
and CKD. Hematocrit was stable throughout admission.  He was
continued on iron and B12 supplementation.

#BPH: Stable.  Polyuria during admission evident.  He was
continued on doxazosin and finasteride.

#COPD: Stable.  He was continued on albuterol and tiotropium
inhalers.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
1. Ventricular tachycardias status post ablation
2. Hyperthyroidism status post thyroidectomy
3. Superficial vein thrombus


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.
Patient is chest pain free.  He is having ventricular
tachycardia once per day but is paced out of it by his
pacemaker.  Thyroidectomy scar is clean, dry, and intact.


Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay here at
[**Hospital1 4**].

You were admitted for ventricular tachycardia refractory to
pacing.  You went for a ablation of a scar in your heart that
was causing this abnormal rhythm.  You are still experiencing
ventricular tachycardia from other scars, however, the pacemaker
is able to stop this rhythm.  In addition, you went for
thyroidectomy for your refractory hyperthyroidism.  Your
prednisone dose was decreased and you were started on
levothyroxine for thyroid supplementation.

The following changes have been made to your medication regimen:

START amiodarone
START levothyroxine
START valsartan
INCREASE rosuvastatin
INCREASE warfarin
DECREASE prednisone
STOP methimazole
START senna as needed for constipation
START miralax as needed for constipation
START oxycodone as needed for pain control

Please follow up with your PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] endocrinologist, your
cardiologist, and your surgeon as noted below. We also
recommended that you have a CT scan of your chest as an
outpatient to follow up fluid that was noted in the lungs. We
discussed this with your parimary care doctor's office and they
will assist you in scheduling this.

Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) **] MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs.
