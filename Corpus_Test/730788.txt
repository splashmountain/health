   Assessment and Plan
   63 year-old male with h/o alcoholism, gastritis, essential tremor, HTN,
   and St. [**Initials (NamePattern4) 6097**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4880**] on home Coumadin who presents with 2 days of
   melanotic stools and acute HCT drop in setting of supratherapeutic INR
   (7.1).
   #. GI Bleed: Hematemesis and maroon stools with h/o erosive gastritis,
   although NG lavage in ED negative. Heavy ETOH use and ongoing Coumadin
   may have both contributed to upper GI bleed. No hemodynamic
   instability; Hct increased with PRBC.
   - GI c/s with EGD this am
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Trend Hct, goal > 30
   - Holding anticoagulation, s/p Vit K and FFP
   #. ETOH abuse: Patient drinking abundance of beer daily. Last drink was
   Monday afternoon ([**5-15**]) so patient at high risk for withdrawal. New
   elevated T. bili likely [**2-28**] ETOH liver disease. HCV negative in past
   with [**Doctor First Name 1168**] + at 1:40.
   - CIWA scale
   - Thiamine, MVI, folate
   - SW consult
   - Trend bilis
   #. Mechanical [**Doctor First Name 4880**] [**2-28**] AS: Goal INR is 2.5-3.5 per ACC guidelines.
   - Await EGD and then start heparin gtt if no concerning findings
   #. HTN:
   - Holding all anti-hypertensives in setting of current GIB
   #. Dementia: Has been evaluated in past and thought [**2-28**] hypoxic or
   microembolic events during surgery or depression/ETOH abuse. A+O x 1 at
   baseline.
