   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTHERMIA
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
 OBESITY (INCLUDING OVERWEIGHT, MORBID OBESITY)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 HEART DISEASE, OTHER
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   78 y/o female with MMP including OSA requiring trach, d CHF, AFib,
   chronic C. diff infection presents from LTAC with worsening mental
   status and failure to improve.
   # Altered Mental Status
 improving, most likely etiology is infection
   - blood cx NGTD
   - sputum cx was done
 growing out pseudomonas, GNRs, GPRs but no
   evidence of pneumonia, may represent colonization
   - urine cx from [**7-8**] grew out citrobacter koseri and klebsiella pneumo.
   Urine cx from [**7-13**] grew yeast only
   - head CT
 no acute intracranial process
   - pt switched to cipro yesterday because it has better urine
   penetration
 will continue cipro for a 5 day course (day 1 = [**2913-7-13**])
   - Check blood Cx and mycolitic cx
   # Leukocytosis
likely stress response vs. infectious response
   - pt on cipro for urine cx with GNR
s - WBC 11.8
   - continue to monitor WBC
   # Hx of C.diff Infection
   - C diff negative x 2 here
   - [**Hospital1 696**] records
 C.diff + in [**Month (only) 1948**] and then [**2913-6-9**]
   - ID recs: PO vanc for 14 days after last dose of cipro, then stop and
   observe for recurrence of c.diff. If recurrence see ID note from
   [**2913-7-14**]
   # Respiratory Failure
 currently with trach; CMV 450 x 15, 12 PEEP and
   50% FIO2
   - oxygenating and ventilating well
   - sputum culture growing pseudomonas, and Pt has h/o pseudomonas in
   sputum.  No evidence of current PNA
   - pt was on diuretics but had no response in UOP; pt is on CVVH with a
   goal of maximum diuresis (has been -12L in 2 days)
   - However, it appears that we are affecting hemodynamics enough to slow
   down on cvvh, as her maps have been in the high 40s.  .
   - will try to wean once diuresis goal reached
   # Diastolic Heart Failure/volume overload
   - no response to lasix or zaroxylyn
   - On CVVH with goal of maximum fluid removal
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
   - creatinine is now 1.2
 improving with fluid removal
   - Baseline is 1.1-1.3
   - continue to monitor BUN, Cr, UOP
   # Anemia
   - Hct trending down and currently 22.5
   - guiac stools and can transfuse [**1-6**] U pRBC during CVVH session for Hct
   <21
   # A.fib/coagulopathy
   - was in AFib on transfer but converted to sinus;
   - Cont. trend INR. Given vitamin K and will check LFT
   - supratherapeutic INR likely due to poor absorption and poor
   production
   - rate control PRN
   # DM2
   - on ISS
   # GERD
   - pt off of PPI as it may interfere with PO vanc
   # Decubitus Ulcers
   - wound care consulted; following recommendations
