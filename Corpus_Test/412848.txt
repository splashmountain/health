TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:  Suicidal ideation
   Reason for MICU admisssion: Alcohol withdrawal
   HPI:
   49 yo man with h/o depression, prior admissions for EtOH withdrawal,
   and s/p nephrectomy who presented to to the ED today for suicidal
   ideation. He describes a longstanding history of EtOH abuse with
   increased intake of 1 quart of vodka and 1 quart of listerine daily
   over the past 2 weeks. In this setting, he developed suicidal ideation
   with a plan to stab himself yesterday night. However, he threw away the
   knife and instead presented to the ED. He reports that his last drink
   was at 6am. Review of OMR records reveals multiple prior presentations
   for suicidal ideation in the setting of vodka and listerine
   intoxication and at least [**5-30**] detox attempts in past. He also has a
   history of blackouts, withdrawal seizures, and delirium tremens.
   In the ED, initial VS were: T 98.1, HR 124, BP 115/68, RR 20, O2sat 99%
   RA. Physical exam notable for mild epigastric pain. Labs notable for
   mild renal failure with Cr 1.3, anion gap of 24, serum EtOH 346 but
   otherwise negative serum and urine tox screen, and ketonuria. He was
   started on a CIWA scale for EtOH withdrawal due to anxiety and tremor
   and subsequently required valium 10mg IV hourly, receiving 4 doses in
   the ED. He also received 1L banana bag and 2L NS, as well as
   ondansetron 2mg IV. Decision was made to admit to MICU for further
   management of EtOH withdrawal. Psych aware with plan to evaluate when
   stabilized. Prior to transfer, labs repeated with improvement in anion
   gap to 16 and decrease in serum EtOH to 98. Lactate 3.9. VS on
   transfer: T 99.2, HR 111, BP 105/54, RR 17, O2sat 99% RA.
   On the floor, pt reports feeling anxious and tremulous. Denies current
   suicidal ideation, visual or auditory hallucinations. Reports feeling
   hungry with last meal on Saturday. He has mild nausea but no abdominal
   pain. Of note, no urine output since presentation until foley placed on
   floor.

   Assessment and Plan
   49 yo man with a history of depression as well as multiple past
   presentations for suicidal ideation in the setting EtOH intoxication
   here again with same complaint and admitted for EtOH withdrawal.
   EtOH withdrawal: Pt with longstanding history of EtOH abuse as well as
   EtOH withdrawal including withdrawal seizures and delirium tremens. Now
   admitted for EtOH withdrawal with signs/symptoms of tremor and
   tachycardia approximately 18 hours since his last drink.
   - Valium 10mg IV prn to achieve light sedation, then q1h for CIWA > 10
   - Monitor electrolytes; replete K, Mg, Phos, Ca prn
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - Daily MVI, thiamine, folate
   - NPO for now
   - Social Work consult
   - Psych consult in AM: pt reports interest in detox
   Suicidal ideation: H/o depression with multiple prior presentations for
   suicidal ideation in the setting of EtOH intoxication. Pt currently
   denies SI/HI.
   - 1:1 sitter for now
   - H/o paxil but not currently taking meds
   - Psych to evaluate in AM
   Elevated anion gap: Likely multifactorial with ketosis from EtOH
   intoxication as well as likely starvation ketosis. Also with elevated
   lactate. Serum/urine tox screens otherwise negative. Now improving s/p
   2L IVF in ED.
   - Continue aggressive IV fluid resuscitation
   - Trend lactate
   - Repeat U/A
   - NPO for now but po diet in AM if alert
   Acute renal failure: S/p nephrectomy in past with baseline Cr of 1. Cr
   1.3 on admission but now improved to 1.1. Likely prerenal in the
   setting of decreased po intake given Hct suggestive of
   hemoconcentration and improvement in Cr with IV fluids.
   - Continue IV fluids as above
   - Monitor urine output and trend Cr
   - No further work-up for now given interval improvement on IV fluids
   Urinary retention: No h/o urinary retention. [**Month (only) 56**] be in setting of EtOH
   intoxication or valium.
   - Foley for now with voiding trial when acute issues stabilized
   Diffuse TWI: Nonspecific. Cardiac risk factors of HTN and
   hyperlipidemia but ACS unlikely in absence of chest pain.
   - Repeat ECG in AM; try to obtain more recent ECG for comparison
   Hypertension: BP currently controlled. Not currently taking meds. Will
   need outpatient follow-up.
   Hyperlipidemia: Not currently taking meds. Will need outpatient
   follow-up.
   Rash: Diffuse, papular and pustular lesions stable x 1 month. Ddx acne
   vulgaris v. folliculitis. No evidence of cellulitic superinfection.
   - Monitor
   Polycythemia: Hct 52 on admission. Likely represents hemoconcentration
   in setting of dehydration.
   - Hydrate overnight and trend Hct in AM
   Tobacco abuse:
   - Smoking cessation advised
   - Nicotine patch
