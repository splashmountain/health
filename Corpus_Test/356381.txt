   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7194**] is a 63 year old male with extensive cardiac history,
   admitted with pancreatitis complicated by ARDS and necrosis.
    #) Failure to Wean, Respiratory failure: ventilation and oxygenation
   ok; difficulty weaning with VS instability  & tachypnea with PSV.
   Resistance calculated at 4, compliance 48 this morning.  Poor
   compliance likely from chest wall edema, ? pancreatitis causing local
   inflammation and ARDS.  TG stable.
   -- continue sedation with propofol 75 cc/hr; decrease as tolerated
   -- fentanyl 50 patch for pain control; may need boluses.
   -- will keep I/O goal even today; renal function decreasing which is
   limiting further diuresis
   -- family meeting to discuss goals of care and possibility of trach
   (has been on the vent for 12 days now) is planned for afternoon of
   [**3088-12-28**]
    #) Ileus: + BS now with decreased NG tube output, though still no BM
   in over one week; KUB
s earlier in week were negative for
   obstruction.   Likely [**1-21**] pancreatitis.   Lots of biliary secretions
   above ET tube; aspiration risk.
   -- cont Reglan and PO narcan
    #) Hypotensive: [**Last Name **] problem; given bump in Cr and lowish CVP, starting
   to dry out now; PEEP likely impeding venous return causing hypotension
   -- no need for boluses at this point
   -- decrease PEEP
   #) ARF: Cr bumped from 1.3 to 1.7 overnight likely from
   contrast-induced nephropathy (CT performed on [**12-25**]) and volume
   contraction.  Possibly also med effect , possibly from vancomycin
   -- will run I/O
s even w/o goal negative; will hold on giving back IVF
   at this point
   -- monitor UOP; was good overnight w/ little concern for obstruction
   -- renally dose medicines.
   #) Necrotic Pancreatitis: Patient with severe, acute pancreatitis.
   Based on gallstones seen on CT from OSH (per surgery
s evaluation of
   this imaging), and based on improvement in LFT
s and CBD, story is most
   consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. No history of EtOH use or
   elevated triglycerides.   CT from [**12-25**] showed necrotic pancreas, but no
   drainable fluid collection to tap.  Will cont treating empirically for
   infected pancreatic necrosis given persistent fevers and rising WBC off
   abx, though no way to know for sure.
   -- supportive care; NPO
   -- cont insulin drip for glucose control
   -- will need cholecystitis in the long-term
   -- cont [**Last Name (un) 411**]
   #) Fevers: has been afebrile overnight; WBC stable with bandemia; vanco
   level high today
   -- hold today
s vanco dose; check in am
   -- cont [**Last Name (un) 411**] but renally dose
   #) Rising LFT
s: recent abd CT showed patent portal vein & ? small
   hepatic cysts; likely med effect (? Antibiotics)
   -- will cont to trend (somewhat higher on [**12-27**] though not increasing at
   same rate as earlier in week)
   -- will consider RUQ US if continues to increase; nothing seen on
   recent abd CT that is concerning for hepatic process
   #) Hypernatremia: stable now; cont to follow
