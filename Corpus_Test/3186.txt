Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2046**]
Chief Complaint:
palpitations at home

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
VT ablation [**7-16**]

History of Present Illness:
80 y/o woman with known CAD s/p 2 vessel CABG (10 yrs ago),
ischemic cardiomyopathy, CHF last echo [**5-11**] (EF 25%), moderate
to severe MR, LBBB, persistent Afib (s/p biventricular pacer and
atrioventricular nodal ablation, end of [**2504-5-7**]) and COPD,
now presents after palpitation episode at home.
Mid [**2504-5-7**], the pt presented to [**Hospital6 33**] with
significant heart failure, with Afib and LBBB.  She had an ICD
placed ([**1-9**] body habitus, comorbid conditions and age).  After
the ICD was placed, she underwent AV junction ablation, which
was successful.  She had intermittent episodes of palpitations
("couples of episodes over the last week") without chest pain,
diaphoresis, dizziness, lightheadedness or syncope.  No arm
numbness or shoulder pain.  One day PTA, she had 2 similar
episodes, one of which lasted a few minutes, and one which
persisted and prompted her to call EMS.  In the ambulance, she
was found to have a wide complex tachycardia (rate 180-200),
cycling 310 msec with superior axis morphology based on a 3 lead
rhythm strip in the ambulance.  This spontanceously converted.
She was given IV adenosine 6mg then 12mg, and 100mg lidocaine,
and then spontaneously reverted back to NSR.  In the ER, was in
NSR and loaded with 150mg amiodarone and then amiodarone gtt
then had another episode of tachyarrhythmia.  EP fellow put a
magnet over her which converted her to VOO, back to NSR.  She is
being v-paced in the 70s.  She was subsequently admitted to CCU
for further mgmt.  Initial CE negative.
.
Last echocardiogram was [**2504-5-31**]:
LV is significantly dilated.  Severe hypokinesis involving all
segments of the left ventricle though the apex is akinetic.
Left V fxn is severly reduced and estimated LVEF of 20-25%.
Aoric valve leaflets are mildly thickened without restriction to
flow.  4+MR [**First Name (Titles) 150**] [**Last Name (Titles) 13003**] of flow in the pulmonary veins.  Left
atrium is enlarged to 4.6cm.  RA nl. Right [**Last Name (Titles) 14774**] size is
nl. Moderately severe TR.  PA systolic pressure of 65mm Hg.


Past Medical History:
1.  CAD s/p CABG [**08**] years ago, says she has had a stent placed
since then (does not know exact date)
2.  severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, CHF with EF 20%
3.  severe MR, severe TR
4.  atrial fibrillation tx with biventricular pacer for
bradyarrhythmias ([**May 2504**]), and then with persistent Afib, had
an AV nodal ablation
5.  COPD
6.  Hypothyroidism

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression:  80y/o woman with history of CAD s/p 2 vessel CABG
[**08**] years ago, Afib s/p BiV pacer s/p ablation with persistent
paroxysmal Afib, COPD, now presents with palpitations,
tachyarrhythmia and CHF.
1.  Tachyarrhythmia, wide complex rate 180-200, currently
resolved:  The patient was begun on an amiodarone drip.  She was
without further tachyarrhythmia during her CCU admission.  She
was monitored on telemetry, with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**],
Electrophysiology, following her.  She underwent a successful VT
ablation by Electrophysiology.  Daily EKGs were completed.  She
was felt to be stable on her medication, and will be discharged
home on amiodarone with follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**].
2.  Congestive Heart Failure/Ischemic Cardiomyopathy:  Her
recent echo at OSH ([**5-11**]) shows EF: 20-25%.  Aoric valve
leaflets are mildly thickened without restriction to flow.
4+MR. [**First Name (Titles) 165**] [**Last Name (Titles) 14774**] size is nl. Moderately severe TR.  She
had flat cardiac enzymes.  We held her digoxin, and continued
her aldactone, lasix, ASA.  We also held her ACEI as she had low
blood pressures during her admission.  We diuresed her with IV
lasix for fluid goal -1L per day during her admission. Her
discharge CXR was read as "mild pulmonary edema which continues
to clear, small bilateral pleural effusions, partially fissural
on the right, improving. Severe cardiomegaly is stable."  She
will be discharged with a f/u appt with Cardiology to follow her
CHF.
3.  Coronaries:
ASA was continued, and a lipid panel was checked, with her
cholesterol being 182, Triglycerides 1121, HDL 66, and LDL 94.
She was started on a statin. Her beta blocker was continued.
4.  Pump: EF 20-25%  We initially held digoxin, then added it
back, diuresed her with fluid goal -1L per day.  Her digoxin
level at the OSH was 1.6.  Her pulmonary edema improved over her
hospital course.
5.  Electrical: as above tachyarrhythmia, h/o Afib
The patient was on coumadin on admission.  She was also started
on an amiodarone gtt for rhythm management during her stay, and
will be discharged on amiodarone with follow up with cardiology
and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**].
6.  Pulmonary: h/o COPD, using accessory muscles to breathe, but
family reports she has been breathing this way for months.  CXR
revealed pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions, which
continued to improve over her hospital stay as she was diuresed.
 She will be discharged on lasix.  Her ABG and sats were stable.
 We continued her advair diskus, initially holding her spiriva.
She can follow up with her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] cardiology to re-start
Spiriva.
7.  Hypothyroidism
Her TSH at OSH was normal.  Her TSH was rechecked here, and
found to be 1.2 (normal).  We continued her levothyroxine, home
dose.  She should follow up with her PCP for periodic checks on
her TSH.
8.  DNR/DNI- Had conversation which was documented.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 73**] was notified and this was documented online.
