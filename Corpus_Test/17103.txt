Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89-year-old
female with a history of hypertension who presented to an
outside hospital on [**3399-6-27**] with a complaint of central
chest pain lasting 30 minutes.

The pain was [**11-1**] in intensity, did not have any radiation,
and was not associated with any shortness of breath,
diaphoresis, or palpitations.  The patient was treated in the
Emergency Department with aspirin and nitroglycerin which did
not relieve the pain.

Electrocardiogram demonstrated ST elevations of 2 mm to 4 mm
in leads V1 through V5, a right bundle-branch block, and Q
waves in leads V1 through V3.  She was started on heparin, an
nitroglycerin drip, and then treated with TNK 30 mg
intravenously for thrombolysis.

A repeat electrocardiogram one hour later demonstrated
persistent ST elevations, and the patient continued to have
pain rating [**4-1**] in intensity.  The nitroglycerin drip was
increased to 90 mcg per minute prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 1205**] for intervention, and she was
then pain free.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension (on multiple medications).
2.  Bilateral cataracts.
3.  Status post cholecystectomy.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Aspirin.
2.  Atenolol 75 mg p.o. once per day.
3.  Diovan 80 mg p.o. once per day.
4.  Clonidine 0.1 mg p.o. once per day.
5.  Norvasc 5 mg p.o. once per day.
6.  Isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg p.o. two to three times per
day.
7.  Amitriptyline 10 mg p.o. q.h.s.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies any tobacco history.  She
lives at home alone.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history was noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   On physical
examination, the patient was afebrile with a temperature of
98.2, heart rate was 77, blood pressure was 150/70,
respiratory rate was 16, and oxygen saturation was 94% on 2
liters by nasal cannula.  In general, the patient was
pleasant and in no apparent distress.  Head and neck
examination revealed mucous membranes were dry.  The
oropharynx was clear.  No carotid bruits.  The lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.   Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a
systolic murmur and positive third heart sound.  The abdomen
was benign.  Extremities had trace edema bilaterally.
Neurologic examination revealed cranial nerves II through XII
were grossly intact and the patient had 5/5 strength.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Outside
hospital laboratories demonstrated white blood cell count was
13.1, hematocrit was 39.7, and platelets were 353.  A
Chemistry-7 panel was significant for a blood urea nitrogen
of 40 and a creatinine of 1.7.  Initial creatine kinase
levels at the outside hospital were negative.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray demonstrated no
acute process.

Upon left heart catheterization, the patient's left main
coronary artery was found to be normal.  The left anterior
descending artery had diffuse disease with a focal proximal
80% lesion.  The left circumflex had minimal irregularities.
The right coronary artery had a 60% to 70% mid lesion.  The
left anterior descending artery lesion was stented
successfully.  Right heart catheterization demonstrated right
atrial pressures of 10, right ventricular of 40/70, pulmonary
artery pressures of 38/19, and a pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure of 22.  Cardiac output and index were 3.06 and 1.99;
respectively.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient's repeat
electrocardiogram demonstrated resolution of the ST
elevations and large Q waves in leads V1 through V5.

She was treated with aspirin, Plavix, and a statin was
started.  Her creatine kinase peaked at 7400, and the MB peak
was 1075.

A repeat echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of
30% to 35%, and the patient experienced some mild heart
failure.  She was diuresed with Lasix and maintained good
oxygen saturations.  She was also started on her beta blocker
and ACE inhibitor as well as long-acting nitrates.

Due to her depressed ejection fraction and large anterior
wall myocardial infarction, the patient was at risk for
sudden cardiac death from arrhythmias.  The option of an
internal defibrillator was discussed with the patient, and
she wished to defer at this time.  Her right coronary artery
lesion may be addressed within six months.

Further monitoring on telemetry demonstrated no progressive
dysrhythmias.

2.  RENAL ISSUES:  Repeat laboratories demonstrated a normal
creatinine of 1.  She did not require any fluids for
rehydration, nor did she have any renal failure during her
hospitalization.

3.  HYPERTENSION ISSUES:  The patient's blood pressure was
maintained well with beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, and
continued calcium channel blocker.  Her clonidine was
discontinued.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient's condition on discharge
was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was to be discharged to
rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Anterior myocardial infarction.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Congestive heart failure (with an ejection fraction of
35%).

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once per day.
2.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. once per day (times nine months).
3.  Atenolol 75 mg p.o. once per day.
4.  Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. once per day.
5.  Norvasc 5 mg p.o. once per day.
6.  Imdur 30 mg p.o. once per day.
7.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. once per day.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was to follow up with her primary care
provider in one to two weeks.
2.  The patient was to follow up with her cardiologist in
several months and consider addressing her right coronary
artery lesion as well as placement of an automatic internal
cardioverter-defibrillator if she wishes.
