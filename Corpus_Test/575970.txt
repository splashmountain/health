   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o F with PMHx of biventricular heart failure and moderate pulm
   hypertension presents with pleuritic chest pain, hypoxia and DOE
   transferred to the MICU for hemoptysis following thoracentesis.  She is
   extubated now and doing well.
   # Hypoxia S/P Thoracentesis:  The patient is extubated and awake today,
   still requiring 5L O2 per NC.  Her Hct remains stable and her CXR is
   consistent with continued effusion and fluid overload.  She had a small
   response to lasix gtt overnight.
   -          Lasix 80mg IV BID goal net -1-2L today
   -          PM Electolytes
   -          Nebs PRN
   # Afib:  The patient was not anticoagulated previously secondary to
   recent Dx of Duodenal Ulcer.  Will not start anticoagulation in the
   setting of acute bleed.
   - Metoprolol 25mg PO TID, uptitrate as needed to control rate.
   # Ulcerative Colitis: currently asymptomatic, continue home regimen
   - Asacol 800mg TID
   # Hypotension:  Resolved with elevated CVP.
   # Chest pain:  Resolved. EKGs essentially unchanged, CE's ruled out and
   cardiac cath in [**11-13**] was normal.
   -          Hold Aspirin
   -          Restart metoprolol 25mg PO TID, uptitrated as needed.
   # Hypertension: Restart Metoprolol as above
   # FEN Discontinue tube feeds for SBT, replete lytes PRN
   # Access: Re-establish PIV or place PICC, D/C L IJ, right radial line
   # PPx: pneumoboots, bowel regimen, IV PPI
   # Code: FULL
   # Dispo: Call out to HMED
