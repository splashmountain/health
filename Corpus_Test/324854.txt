   BCx [**8-14**] and [**8-15**] pending
   UCx [**8-14**] pending
   TTE [**2668-8-15**]:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). There
   is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular free wall is
   hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed
   free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
   level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting
   structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The main pulmonary
   artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are dilated. There is
   no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2668-2-21**], the findings are similar.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known patient lastname 5051**] is a 73 yo female with PTLD s/p R-CHOP, s/p liver
   transplant in [**2660**] for cryptogenic cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis, type
   2 diabetes, and HTN admitted for constellation of non-specific symptoms
   such as fatigue, urinary incontinence, shortness of breath, and leg
   swelling.
   .
   1.  Dyspnea/fatigue.  Unclear if these symptoms truly represent a
   difference from baseline. Per patient she is at baseline dyspnea.  [**Month (only) 56**]
   be secondary to deconditioning. Currently being covered empirically
   with vanc/levofloxacin (day #2). Cultures pending. Also may be
   component to diastolic dysfunction and known pulmonary fibrosis and
   moderate pulmonary HTN (but not changed from prior per repeat TTE
   yesterday).  Patient weaned back to home O2 dose at 2L NC.
   Hemodynamically stable.
   - continue home prednisone at 40mg PO daily
   - continue vanc/levo (day#2 today) for now, but if cultures negative
   after 24 hours, can consider d/c abx
   .
   2.  s/p Tachycardia.  Patient had sinus tachycardia and then A. fib
   with RVR on day of admission.  HR has increased in recent months at
   outpatient visits.  Concern for ongoing A. fib with RVR with poor RV
   function and possible diastolic dysfunction.  Normal TSH.  No evidence
   of dehydration. Patient
s HR has been well controlled overnight HR
   70-80s on 25mg PO metoprolol. Patient
s BP transiently decreases to SBP
   80s after administration of metoprolol but patient mentating well and
   this is controlling her HR well.
   - continue metoprolol 25mg PO TID for rate control. Can switch to
   12.5mg PO QID if continues to have large transient BP drop after 25mg
   dosing
   - continue aspirin
   - determine why patient is not on anticoagulation
   - f/u with family and/or PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]: whether anticoagulation would be
   feasible for patient
   .
   3.  S/p liver transplant, on tacrolimus.
   - check tacrolimus level
   4.  IPF.  Patient requires 2-2.5L/NC at home, currently back on home
   dosing.  On Prednisone 40 mg daily.
   - continue steroids
   - continue supplemental oxygen to maintain O2 sats > 95
   .
   5.  DM. On NPH and RISS. NPH uptitrated overnight due to high BS and
   her sugars have been controlled in 100s so far today
   - follow fingersticks
   - continue NPH 30/10 and RISS. Uptitrate as needed.
   .
   6. Hypothyroidism
 TSH normal
   - continue home dose of levothyroxine
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Diabetic diet
   Glycemic Control:  Uncontrolled overnight with highest BS in 400s.
   Evening NPH was increased from 5 to 10 units overnight. Current control
   is good.
