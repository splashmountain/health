   Sputum Cx with 2+ GPC in pairs on gram stain, culture pending

   Assessment and Plan
   53F with obesity hypoventilation on home CPAP with multiple hospital
   admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure, OSA,
   panhypopituitarism, pulmonary HTN, diastolic CHF who presented with
   fatigue, and intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   #)Hypercarbic respiratory failure: ABGs overnight showed some
   overventilation with pCO2 in 50s. Being trialed on PSV this AM, goal to
   have pCO2 in high 60s. Patient with no complaints on admission, CXR
   without clear infiltrate, but will f/u on sputum Cx with GPCs in gram
   stain. Increased WBC difficult to separate from increase [**1-28**] to steroid
   dose in ED. If patient spikes fever, low threshold to start antibiotics
   to cover for PNA
   - wean down on vent with goal pCO2 60s, possible extubation today
   - continue to hold on sedation and allow patient to wake
   - f/u fever curve, add abx if spikes
   - continue home CPAP for OSA (16cm H2O)
   - resend sputum culture to r/o pneumonia but hold on any antibiotics
   .
   #) Facial swelling: Per daughter, patient without notable increase in
   facial swelling. Patient with no signs of anaphylaxis, acute allergic
   angiodema, no tongue swelling or urticaria. Had history of angioedema
   with ACEi, but has been on [**Last Name (un) 223**] with no medication changes recently to
   explain new facial swelling. Could also be [**1-28**] volume overload with
   morbid obesity and diastolic dysfunction. Also would want to rule out
   subclavian vein thrombosis or SVC syndrome in this patient with prior
   central line placement. Symptoms improved with steroids, benadyrl,
   pepcid in ED
   - assess for airway and tongue edema after intubation
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 223**]
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: patient has had episodes of hypernatremia in past,
   but is increased overnight
   - 500ml D5 bolus, recheck lytes in PM
   .
   #) LE edema/erythema: Unclear baseline. No white count of fever to
   indicate cellulitis. No history of diabetes or vascular disease, but
   likel chronic venous stasis changes. Received vanco/zosyn in ED.
   - hold on antibiotics for now
   - f/u blood cultures
   - follow exam, white count, fever curve off antibiotics
   .
   #) Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: On CPAP at home. Did not keep last
   appointment with outpatient sleep lab. Likely component of patient's
   hypercarbic respiratory failure
   - continue CPAP when extubated
   - set up patient with close follow up for sleep study and weight
   management
   .
   #)Diastolic CHF: Patient hypervolemic by CXR, JVD difficult to assess
   with body habitus, no LE edema. Patient not on lasix at home
   - allow patient to autodiurese and follow UOP and CXR
   .
   #)Panhypopituitarism: Thought to be secondary to "empty sella". No
   evidence of shock, hypotension.
   - continue on home dose of Prednisone 5mg, Levoxyl, and Desmopressin.
   .
   #)Hypertension:
   - hold diovan given facial edema
   - continue on home dose of metoprolol
   .
   #) Social issues: Patient was sent into ED for unclear reasons, patient
   lives at home with daughter but has had difficulty with caring for
   patient in addition to her children. Patient has had h/o noncompliance
   with appointments and meds. Upon discharge, will need to make sure case
   management helps with services at home, or possible need for SNIF
   placement.
