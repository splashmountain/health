   ascites. Since her admission, Pt was transferred to [**Doctor Last Name 2522**]-[**Doctor Last Name **]
   service and today to MICU. Reason for transfer is Pt's worsening
   respiratory status. At time of transfer Pt is maintaining 02 sats in
   90s on non-rebreather. Earlier Pt had episodes of hypoxia to 80s on
   while on 3l NC in setting of receiving methadone dose this morning.  Pt
   also still w/ [**Last Name (un) 2359**] to 2.0 due to hepatorenal syndrome.

   Assessment and Plan
 47 yo woman with a history of chronic Hep C cirrhosis complicatied by
   portal HTN and refractory ascites, DM, s/p failed TIPS procedure,
   presented with abdominal ascites, bilateral leg edema, and found to
   have an elevated creatinine and today transferred to MICU to due
   worsening respiratory status.
   .
   # Hypoxia - Patient with hypoxia overnight and new oxygen requirement.
   Currently on 15L rebreather and 4L NC maintaining 02 sats at 92-93%.
   Given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 prior to transfer.
   Acute hypoxic event earlier today likely due to decreasing respiratory
   drive from methadone in setting of increased pulmonary edema.
   - Continue 02 as tolerated on non-rebreather and nasal cannula. Will
   add BiPap as needed to maintain 02 Sats>92%
   - check daily weight
   - elevate head of bed >30 degrees.
   - follow clinically with serial chest exams
   - albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6h prn SOB or wheezing
   - sparing use of diuretics due to HRS
   - Will fluid restrict to 750 cc
   .
   # ARF: Pt w/ Cr of 2.7 on admission from baseline of 1.2 in early [**Month (only) 91**],
   now 2.0, from 1.9 yesterday. Currently undergoing treatment for HRS. No
   hypertension. Last paracentesis [**9-8**] ~3L. Urine Na 21 on [**9-5**], urine
   culture with contaminants. Potassium at time of transfer is 5.2.
   - Repeat serum lytes
   - Kayexalate PRN
   - low potassium diet
   - Continue [**Month (only) **]/mid/alb, goal creatinine 1.5, no diuretics at this time
   - monitor blood pressur
   - daily creatinine
   .
   # HCV cirrhosis and ascites: Pt w/ chronic HCV and cirrhosis (Grade 1
   varices and congestive gastropathy) that is usually managed by weekly
   parascentesis, s/p failed TIPS ([**7-15**]). SBP (-) on [**9-8**]. Also has elevated
   AFP=10.2. Para cx NG from [**9-8**]. Patent main portal vein and hepatic
   vasculature. MELD 20 today.
   - continue [**Month (only) **]/mild/albumin - patient appears to be benefitting
   - continue holding diuretics
   - continue lactulose
   - consider paracentsis today
   - TIPS to be done as outpatient.
   - f/u on calorie count.
   .
   # Diabetes. Patient reports that her diabetes is well controlled on
   insulin at home.
   - Continue Insulin.
