Brief Hospital Course:
After the preineal resection of his rectal prolapse, Dr. [**Known patient lastname 23852**]
was admitted to the surgical floor. He had an uncomplicated
immediate postoperative course and developed bowel function on
POD1. His incision was clean/dry and intact. Late on POD2 his
mental status declined and he was protectively intubated. He was
found to have a WBC of 1. He was transferred to the intensive
care unit where he became hypotensive over night. His blood
pressure was stabilized with several fluid boluses initially.
Then Levaphed was added to support his pressure. He was
pancultured and empirically started on broad spectrum anibiotics
as well as antifungal coverage. It was felt that he had a septic
reaction with unknown source. A CT scan of his body was obtained
and showed a small infiltrate in his right lower lobe. His
sputum cultures grew pansensitive Klebsiella as well as
nonspecified gram-positive cocci and yeast. His mental status
improved and he was able to comunicate with his family who was
at his bedside every day of his postoperative course. On POD5,
he was on minimal vent settings and only a small amount of
pressor. His family, who had changed his status to DNR/DNI
previously, requested in conjunction with Mr. [**Known patient lastname 23852**] to extubate
him to spend some time with him. The family and the patient were
well aware that there may be a need for re-intubation. He was
extubated and spent time with his family. During the course of
[**2573-11-6**], he tired out and had respiratory distress. The patient
and the family refused intubation according to his official DNI
status. Dr. [**Known patient lastname 23852**] expired peacefully with his family in the
room on [**2573-11-6**]. The family requested that no autopsy would be
performed.
