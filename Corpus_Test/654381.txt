TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:  fever and hypotension
   HPI:
   60 yo f with hx of MS, and recurrent UTIs, now presenting from NH to ER
   with fever and hypotension. She was discharged about 1 week about from
   [**Location (un) 76**] where she was treated for a UTI with ceftazidime. She was still
   on abx with her PICC, but today developed fever to 103.5 and her BP was
   in the 80s systolic (baseline is in 100s). She denies chills, cough,
   SOB, rash, diarrhea/constipation, or dysuria. She states she has had
   many UTIs, and has required a Foley for the last year due to [**Location (un) 3155**]
   bladder. Her urine has high amounts of sediment and she had been
   clogging off her Foley every 3 weeks until about a month ago when a
   larger 22 french Foley was placed. At her NH she was given Tylenol
   650mg before transfer. There her WBC was elevated to 19 and she had new
   renal failure with a Cr 2.12 and Na or 129. Pt reports some nausea with
   no emesis and poor PO intake for last few days with generalized
   fatigue.
   .
   In the ER, pt was afebrile with VS 99 85 82/57 12 /97%RA. She was given
   Zosyn and vancomycin and 3 liters of NS. BP improved to 90s before
   transfer to the MICU. CXR without acute process. Urine was very
   purulent. EKG WNL, despite elevated K.
   .
   Review of systems:
   (+) Per HPI
   (-) Denies chills, night sweats, headache, congestion. Denied cough,
   shortness of breath. Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
   Denied vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No recent

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo f with hx of MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 3155**] bladder with recent urosepsis,
   now admitted with fever and hypotension in likely setting of urinary
   tract infection.
   .
   # Sepsis/Hypotension/Leukocytosis: Pt with hypotension and fevers, WBC
   of 21. Urine appears infected. Pt has a chronic Foley and has a hx of a
   recent UTI. Also has a hx of urinary tract infections including renal
   abscess from nephrolithiasis. Also has a PICC line that was placed at
   least a week ago at an OSH, so at risk for line infection. CXR does not
   show evidence of a pulmonary process. Also has a risk of sepsis due to
   her sacral ulcer, which has recently worsened per pt. Had bacteremia
   earlier this year with MRSA and proteus.
   - aggressive IVF tonight
   - f/u on blood cx, urine cx
   - cx sacral wound
   - CT scan of abd/pelvis to look for renal stones and infection (no
   contrast due to ARF)
   - consider central line placement if needed for pressors
   - place second PIV
   - remove PICC line and culture tip
   - continue vanco/Zosyn for now due to prior sensitivities
   - replace Foley tonight
   - remove fentanyl patch for now due to hypotension
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Urine lytes FENa of 144, this is more consistent
   with renal or post renal failure, however, unclear how much IVF pt had
   been given by the time these labs were checked in the ER.  Pt likely
   also has a prerenal component due to her sepsis. Has a hx of
   nephrolithiasis and of high amount of urine sediment. Also appears to
   have an active UTI that is worsening the renal function
   - CT to look for hydronephrosis and stones
   - ren ally dose meds
   - monitor UO
   - f/u on urine lytes
   - consider a three way Foley if decreased UO, will need latex free
   .
   # Sacral ulcer: stage III vs stage IV ulcer on sacrum. [**Month (only) 11**] be
   contributing to her current sepsis
   - continue vanc and Zosyn for now
   - wound cx
   - wound nurse c/s
   - obtain air mattress for prevention of further worsening
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Na of 126 on admission, was likely having hypovolemia
   hyponatremia. Was 129 at NH earlier. Could be having SIADH vs sodium
   loss from renal damage.
   - getting NS IVF for now
   - monitor Na [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor mental status
   .
   # Multiple Sclerosis: progressive disease, advanced, limits pts
   mobility
   - monitor for change in sx
   - will c/s neuro if worsens
   .
   # Depression/Anxiety: stable
   - continue home Paxil and Ritalin
   - ativan PRN home dose
   .
   # Anemia: stable at baseline, per pt had recent transfusion a week ago
   - monitor hct
   - transfuse if <21
   .
   # Chronic pain:
   - removed fentanyl patch for now due to hypotension
   - will use PRN diluadid and tyelnol for pain
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: likely secondary to renal failure, no EKG changes
   - will give dose of Kayexalate
   - monitor K level
   - monitor on tele
