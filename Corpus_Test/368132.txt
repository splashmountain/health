MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   09:45
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. The ICU team note
   from today reflects my input.  I would add/emphasize that he is a 65
   y/o man OSA, COPD, PHTN, AF s/p AVJ ablation, and cirrhosis of unclear
   etiology.  He presented with profound coagulopathy (INR >20) and marked
   GIB. Intubated for endoscopy, which showed clean based DU. Extubated
   without events.  His Hct has been stable for 24 hours, without clinical
   bleeding.  On exam, he is comfortable and has basilar crackles and
   edema.  He is on 6L n/c.
   Assessment and Plan
   65 y/o man with GI bleed in the setting of profound coagulopathy.
   Bleed appears to have stabilized, with stable Hct and no clinical
   bleeding for 24 hours.  He is planned for colonoscopy once his prep is
   complete.  Will discuss with GI possibility of sedation by anesthesia
   during his colonoscopy. Has 18g and 20g PIV.  Will continue serial Hcts
   and PPI.
   His oxygen requirement has decreased.  He is on 6L n/c now, and uses 3L
   at home.
   Etiology of cirrhosis unclear; appreciate liver
s help with evaluation.
   Chronic diastolic CHF appears well controlled.
   He declined PAP rx for his OSA last night; will readdress tonight and
   continue O2 for now.
   Transfer to floor.
   Other issues as per the ICU team note from today.
