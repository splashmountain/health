Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3156**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension found at rehab

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right Internal Jugular central line was placed

History of Present Illness:
67 yo male with CAD s/p CABG, CHF EF 20%, HTN, DM2, h/o UTI, h/o
CoNS bacteremia, most recently admitted for ischemic bowel s/p
small bowel resection and anastomosis, now admitted for
hypotension and low grade temps. Patient had been at [**Hospital1 1121**] doing fairly well, when this AM his vitals were checked
and his SBPs were in the 70s. Patient tends to run in the high
90s/low 100s. He was given a 250 cc bolus, with improvement to
the 80s, and then transferred to [**Hospital1 4**] ED for further
evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 100.4, 64, 93/58, 15, 99%2L. He had an
initial CXR which was not too remarkable, but given his
persistent abdominal pain and his recent surgery, patient had a
CT torso which revealed RLL atelectasis, but no acute pathology
in the abdomen/pelvis. He was given vancomycin/zosyn to cover
for HAP as well as any abdominal pathology. UA was negative.
LFTs were WNL. Patient was given 1.5L IVFs in the ED, and given
his significant anemia, he was ordered for 2 units pRBCS which
were not given until after transfer. While he was in the ED, he
was again hypotensive to the low 80s, therefore a RIJ was
placed, and the patient was started on levophed to maintain
MAPs. Surgery was consulted in the ED, felt there was no acute
surgical issue. An ECG showed no acute ischemic changes, trop
was 0.03 and he was given ASA PR. He was then transferred to the
MICU for further evaluation. His vitals prior to transfer were
63, 93/50, 15, 100%2L.

Social History:
Lives in [**Location (un) **], though has been in rehab for much of the
past few months. Former cab driver. Social history is
significant for the current tobacco use of 40 pack years. There
is no history of alcohol abuse or recreational drug use. Lives
with common-law wife of 35 years who is a home health aid.


Family History:
No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or
sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.

Physical Exam:
Vs: T: 96.7 HR: 87  BP: 108/55 RR: 16 02 sats: 94% RA
GEN: Caucasian male in NAD
HEENT: Moist mucus membranes, anicteric
NECK: JVP
CV:: S1, S2 2/6 SEM,  mechanical S2, regular rhythm
RESP: bibasilar crackles
ABD: +bs, soft, NT, obese
Ext: L BKA, R c with chronic venous stasis2+ edema to knees.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate to severe global hypokinesis
(LVEF = 25 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with
normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. [The amount of regurgitation
present is normal for this prosthetic aortic valve.] The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2708-11-30**], the
left ventricular cavity is slightly smaller and global LVEF is
slightly improved. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension is now identified. Increased PCWP.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:

CXR [**12-20**]:

Comparison is made to the prior study from [**2708-12-20**] at 8:25
hours. There is no change in the appearance of the chest. There
is continued bibasilar
atelectasis, elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, small right
pleural
effusion. New right IJ catheter terminates in superior vena
cava. Right PICC is unchanged. The patient is status post
sternotomy.

CT ABDOMEN: [**12-20**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Fluid obstructing the right lower lobe bronchus, resulting in
lobar
atelectasis of the right lower lobe. This may be related to
aspiration.
2. Moderate right pleural effusion and small left pleural
effusion.
3. Patent small bowel anastomosis, without obstruction, fluid
collection, or
other abnormality.
4. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
5. No evidence of new mesenteric ischemia.
6. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
7. Extensive atherosclerotic disease


Brief Hospital Course:
67M with CAD s/p CABG, systolic CHF EF 20%, mechanical [**Month/Year (2) **] for
aortic insufficiency, s/p bental/chabral/AAA repair,  DM2, HTN,
h/o UTI, h/o CoNS bacteremia, recently admitted for ischemic
bowel s/p small bowel resection and primary anastomosis admitted
with hypotension and low grade temps.
.
# SIRS/Sepsis: He was noted to have low grade temperature,
hypotension with white count of 4. In the ED a central line was
placed and sepsis protocal initiated.
The source of infection was not immediately clear - UA negative,
CXR wtih RLL atelectasis vs. aspiration, CT abdomen without
definite pathology, C. diff negative, and no thrombus on echo.
He was started on Levophed, received 2U prbcs and pancultured.
He was started on broad coverage antibiotics including
vancomycin and zosyn for possible aspiration pneumonia and/or
abdominal source and admitted to the MICU.  He did well in the
MICU; was quickly weaned off of pressors and subsequently
required diuresis on the floor. He had a TTE which did not show
evidence of endocarditis. He also received daily EKG's to
evaluate for possible PR prolongation which could indicate
endocarditis. He completed a 10 day course of zosyn and
vancomycin.
.
# Chronic Systolic CHF (EF 20%). The diuretics, carvedilol, and
ACE-I were held on admission in the setting of hypotension. An
echo was done that showeed no change in global systolic function
compared to prior. His hospital course was complicated by flash
pulmonary edema in the setting of HTN during a bowel movement
requiring intubation. He was extubated the following day. He
received diuresis initially with lasix drip and then
subsequently was started on torsemide PO and spironolactone to
goal net negative fluid balance of 0.5-1L per day. He was still
felt to be volume overloaded at discharge so plan to continue
diuresis to net negative 500-1000cc/day with fliud restriction
of 1.5L/day.
.
#Heparin induced thrombocytopenia: Per Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 388**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 21433**], at
[**Hospital 10557**] Rehab, patient has positive HIT antibody test (unclear
optical density). We re-sent heparin dependent antibodies, which
were negative, although after discussion with the blood bank
there was still concern for re-introducting the patient to
heparin. An adverse reaction was added to the patient's
electronic chart pending the completion of these studies.
Patient should not be given heparin, including heparin flushes,
until these tests return.
.
# Anemia: patient had initial Hct drop to 22 in setting of
supratherapeutic INR; received transfusion of 2 U prbcs and
bumped appropriately. He was Guaiac negative in ED. CT without
any evidence of acute bleed. DIC and hemolysis labs did not show
any abnormalities.   Coumadin was held and no FFP given because
patients mechanical valve. Coumadin was reinitiated to maintain
his INR in the therapeutic range, his INR was monitored and he
had no further evidence of bleeding.
.
# Mechical [**Hospital **]: patient on warfarin; INR goal 2.5-3.5.He Arrived
with supratherapeutic INR so warfarin held. His warfarin was
subseqeuntly restarted at home dose with therapeutic INR
maintained between 2-2.5.
.
# Abdominal Pain: patient has chronic abd pain since surgery;
had ischemic bowel and is s/p anastamosis. CT torso without any
acute pathology noted. LFTs are WNL. patient reports that
current pain is consistent with pain he has been having since
discharge. Surgery was aware and saw patient without any new
recommendations made. C.diff was negative.
.
# HTN: During his hospitalization he was hypertensive to the
170s, experiencing flash pulmonary edema with subsequent
transfer to the ICU. He has at this point had several episodes
of flash pulmonary edema raising the question of why his HTN is
difficult to control, and why he flashes so easily. Renal artery
stenosis is a possible etiology of hypertension in the setting
of repeated flash pulmonary edema, however patient had aortogram
in [**2699**] which showed patent renal arteries. Repeat imaging may
be considered as an outpatient. He became hypotensive in the
setting of diuresis in the ICU and his antihypertensives were
initially held, and restarted judiciously, and he remained
normotensive.
.
#DIABETES: Blood sugar control was maintained on an insulin
sliding scale with glargine for basal coverage and humalog based
on finger-sticks three times a day.
