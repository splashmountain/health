Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 906**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD, colonoscopy

History of Present Illness:
70 year old male with DM, dialated ischemic cadiomyopathy
(EF=10%) s/p PCM/ICD, CAD s/p MI x 3 and CABG, aflutter s/p
cardioversion on dabigatran, Stage III CKD, and DM, PVD s/p
right 4th toe amputation on [**3202-7-21**].  He was most recently
admitted on [**3202-8-20**] debridement of his right foot for an
osteomyelitis from a right 4th digit ulcer.  He was discharged
on [**8-27**] to [**Hospital3 **] with a PICC and a 6 week course of
vancomycin.  On [**9-14**] the pt reportedly d/c'd his own PICC.  He
was discharged from Rehab on [**3202-9-16**] on PO vancomycin because he
had no IV access.  He left AMA.  He was doing well at home until
2 days prior to admission when he started to be more "altered"
according to his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] was not responding appropriately and
speaking less.  He had decreased PO intake.  According to his
wife, he "lives" for his food and so she always knows something
is wrong when he loses his appetite.  She denies fevers, sweats
in him.  She said his urine was very cloudy, but denies that he
had reported dysuria.  He did not have increased frequency.  She
was suspicious for a UTI because he had similar symptoms when he
had a previous UTI.  Patient also started having diarrhea 2 days
prior to admission.  He had an unspecified amount of diarrhea
and the wife thought it was secondary to the vancomycin.
.
Of note, the patient was seen in podiatry clinic on [**9-20**] the pt
was seen in podiatry clinic that notes that the right foot was
"friable" but had "no signs of infection".
.
Here in the ER the pt presented altered, and reportedly without
any localizing symptoms, just becoming increasingly altered with
decreased PO intake over the preceding 3-4 days.  The pt's wife
did report that the pt had abdominal pain, but the wife reported
that this was chronic.  In the ER, the pt was 99.4*F, p91,
90/56, r14, 100% on 3L, hypotensive, had "foul" urine, the pt's
right foot was erythematous, and had [**Last Name (un) 94**], and was administered
vancomycin, zosyn, and then D50, 10U regular insulin, calcium
gluconate, and 30mg kayexalate.  A CT head, abdomen, and pelvis
was performed which was unrevealing.  While in the ER, the pt
began to have "shaking".  Per the pt's wife, the shaking is near
baseline as the pt has a near constant tremor, and didn't
particularly notice that it was particularly worse.  Regardless,
a bedside EEG was performed, which revealed seizures.
.
On arrival to the MICU the pt was oriented only to person,
essentially non-verbal.  The wife was [**Name (NI) 221**] and the HPI was
reviewed.
.

Unable to assess given patient was not responding verbally to
most questions

.
EEG [**3202-9-24**]: This telemetry from [**9-25**] showed a
slow and encephalopathic background with some bursts of slowing
and additional generalized blunted sharp waves. Some of these
had a "triphasic" appearance. Early in the record, they could
recur almost once a second, but this was brief and only for five
to ten seconds at a time. After the first half an hour or so,
sharp waves were significantly less frequent and not
particularly rhythmic. They appeared likely to be part of the
encephalopathy. There were no clearly epileptiform features.
There were no focal abnormalities although it should be noted
that encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.
.
CXR (portable AP) [**3202-9-24**]: Cardiomegaly, no signs of CHF or
pneumonia.
.
CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**3202-9-24**]:
1. No evidence of acute intra-abdominal process.
2. Atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and branches.
3. Incidental left extrarenal pelvis; mildly thickened bladder
wall. Correlate for ladder infection.
.
CT Head [**3202-9-24**]: No acute intracranial process.
.
CT Head w/o constrast [**3202-9-27**]:
1. No acute intracranial process detected. If an acute infarct
is suspected, MRI is suggested for further evaluation.
2. Chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
.
EGD [**3202-10-1**]: Normal mucosa in the whole esophagus. Abnormal
mucosa in the stomach.  Normal mucosa in the whole duodenum.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
.
Colonoscopy [**3202-10-8**]: Normal mucosa in the whole colon. Normal
colonoscopy to cecum.
.
CXR (portable AP) [**3202-10-9**]: In comparison to prior examination,
there is now a new right-sided PICC line terminating in an
unclear location behind the ICD wires. It is at least seen up
until the mid SVC and is not seen in the right atrium. So we
assume it is somewhere in between there. The rest of the
examination is unchanged from prior study.

Brief Hospital Course:
70 yo man with a history of diabetes mellitus, systolic CHF
(EF=10%) s/p pacemaker/ICD, CAD s/p MI x 3 and CABG, aflutter
s/p cardioversion on dabigatran, Stage III CKD, PVD s/p right
4th toe amputation on [**3202-7-21**] who presented with altered mental
status, hypotension, and acute kidney injury and had a prolonged
hospital course complicated by GI bleed.
.
# Melena: The patient did not present with any GI symptoms but
in the midst of his hospital course he had multiple melanotic
stools, requiring 2 units PRBCs. EGD showed only gastritis but
no active bleeding. Colonoscopy was normal. Sedation during EGD
and colonoscopy were managed by anesthesia due to the patient's
history of intraoperative cardiac arrest. GI recommended capsule
endoscopy, but the patient declined this procedure. Serology for
H. pylori was negative.
.
The etiology of the patient's bleeding was thought to be related
to accumulation of dabigatran in the setting of severe acute on
chronic kidney injury. Aspirin was continued.  Plavix was
stopped and dabigatran was held. Cardiology was consulted, and
per cardiology and vascular surgery, Plavix is no longer needed.
Following stabilization of the patient's hematocrit and negative
EGD and colonoscopy, the risks and benefits of restarting
dabigatran were discussed with the patient and his wife. The
patient elected to restart dabigatran, which was restarted on
[**3202-10-9**]. The patient will need to continue pantoprazole for at
least 6-8 weeks.
.
# Hypotension: The patient presented with hypotension, which was
most likely related to hypovolemia. He had decreased PO intake
over the few days prior to admission, and his blood pressure
improved with fluid boluses. He was initially covered broadly
with vancomycin and Zosyn for possible urosepsis versus sepsis
from osteomyelitis; however, he rapidly improved without any
further evidence of sepsis.  CT abdomen/pelvis showed no
evidence of acute intra-abdominal process. As the pt was not
febrile, had no leukocytosis, no elevated lactate, and no
localizing symptoms, antibiotics were narrowed just to
vancomycin for the patient's osteomyelitis. Antihypertensives
were initially held, but were all restarted during the [**Hospital **]
hospital course, with the exception of torsemide, which was
held.
.
# Acute on chronic kidney Injury: The patient presented with
creatinine of 8.6 and signs of uremia. His creatnine improved
rapidly with fluid resuscitation and remained stable at 1.0
throughout the remainder of the [**Hospital **] hospital course.  The
patient's acute kidney injury was though to be pre-renal in
etiology, in the setting of poor PO intake, diuretics, and a
potential infectious process. The patient was discharged off of
torsemide, but this will need to be restarted in the future
given the patient's very low ejection fraction.
.
# Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy: The patient had multiple
reasons for altered mental status including sedating medications
and uremia. His mental status improved with resolution of his
renal failure, antibiotics, fluconazole for the yeast in his
urine, and minimizing sedating medications. CT head was
negative. 24hr EEG monitoring showed no clearly epileptiform
features or electrographic seizures and all anti-seizure
medications were stopped.
.
# Urinary Tract Infection: On admission, urine cultures grew
>100,000 colonies of yeast. The patient, was treated with a
7-day course of fluconazole with last dose given on [**10-4**]. The
patient subsequently developed dysuria on [**3202-10-9**], at which time
urinalysis was strongly suggestive of infection. The patient was
started on empiric ceftriaxone pending culture data, with a plan
to treat for 10 days (last day = [**3202-10-19**]). The patient's culture
data at [**Hospital1 4**] will need to be followed to tailor antibiotic
therapy and exclude resistent organisms. The phone number for
the microbiology lab is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7679**].
.
# Osteomyelitis, right foot: Prior to this admission, the
patient was found to have gangrene of his right 4th toe, which
was amputated on [**3202-7-21**]. This was complicated by osteomyelitis,
for which the patient was discharged on vancomycin,
ciprofloxacin, and Flagyl on [**3202-7-26**]. On [**3202-8-16**], he underwent
balloon angioplasty of his right tibioperoneal trunk and
anterior tibialis arteries. This was followed by operative
debridgement of the amputation site and placement of a VAC
device on [**3201-8-20**]. The patient was discharged on a 6-week course
of vancomycin. However, he removed his PICC at rehab on [**3202-9-14**],
and was without IV vancomycin until his current admission on
[**3202-9-24**].
.
During this admission, the patient was followed by podiatry, who
felt that the patient would benefit from an additional 2-3 weeks
of antibiotics, which will be complete on [**3202-10-25**]. For wound
care, the patient should continue daily silvadene dressing
changes. Outpatient infectious disease, vascular surgery, and
podiatry follow-up was arranged.
.
# Hyperkalemia: The patient presented with hyperkalemia in the
setting of acute renal failure. His EKG demonstrated peaked
T-waves. He was treated with insulin, calcium gluconate,
kayexalate, dextrose in the ED. The patient's hyperkalemia
improved with hydration and resolution of his renal failure.
.
# CAD, s/p multiple MIs, CABG ([**3192**]): The patient is s/p CABG
with SVG-PL, SVG-Diagonal and LIMA-LAD. He also has a history of
PTCA of the mid Cx with an Apex OTW 2.25x15 mm. He was continued
on aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily.  All
antihypertensives were initially held, but the patient was
subsequently restarted on isosorbide mononitrate, metoprolol,
and valsartan. In the setting of GI bleeding, Plavix was
stopped. Cardiology was consulted, and confirmed that there was
no coronary indication for Plavix at the present time. Per
cardiology, the patient had been on Plavix due to the recent
balloon angioplasy of his right lower extremity, and that per
vascular surgery, he had completed his course.
.
# Dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy: LVEF of 10%. Digoxin was held
initially because of acute kidney injury, and then resumed at
every other day [**Year (4 digits) **] because of interaction with fluconazole.
Digoxin was subsequently changed to daily [**Year (4 digits) **] at the time of
discharge. The patient will need a digoxin level checked 1 week
after discharge. Torsemide was held in the setting of acute
renal failure and then continued to be held because of GI bleed.
At the time of discharge, the patient appeared euvolemic, so
torsemide was not restarted. Consideration should be given to
restarting torsemide in the outpatient setting. The patient
needs his fluid status monitored closely, and need a strict,
low-sodium diet.
.
# Atrial flutter: Status post cardioversion [**3201-1-12**].
Dabigatran was held initially because of GI bleeding, which was
likely related to accumulated dabigatran in the setting of acute
kidney injury. Dabigatran was restarted on [**3202-10-9**] after
colonoscopy and EGD failed to identify a source of bleeding, and
the patient's Hct had been stable for several days.
.
# Dyslipidemia: Continued atorvastatin.
.
# Peripheral vascular disease: The patient is s/p angioplasty of
right tibioperoneal trunk and anterior tibialis artery on
[**3202-8-16**]. Per vascular surgery, he only needed plavix for 1st
month out from procedure. He will continue ASA 81mg daily.
Plavix was stopped. Vascular follow-up was arranged.
.
# Diabetes mellitus: The patient was managed with NPH and a
sliding scale. At the time of discharge, he had good glycemic
control.
.
# Anemia: The patient was anemic throughout his hospitalization.
There was an acute component from acute blood loss, requiring
transfusion of 2 units PRBCs. However, there also appeared to be
a chronic component that is likely due to chronic disease in the
setting of osteomyelitis, plus a possible component of iron
deficiency. The patient was started of ferrous sulfate 325 mg
daily.
.
# Medication reconciliation: Medications started during this
admission include pantoprazole, IV vancomycin, IV ceftriaxone,
senna, and multivitamin. Plavix, gabapentin, oxycodone,
oxycontin, and trazadone were stopped. The patient was also on
oral vancomycin prior to admission, but there was no indication
for this. He really needed IV vancomycin for his osteomyelitis.
.
# Code Status: FULL CODE.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
1. The patient was discharged off of torsemide. The patient's
volume status should be monitored closely. The patient has a
very low ejection fraction of 10% and diuretics should be
resumed at the earlier sign of fluid accumulation. The patient's
cardiologist can be [**Date Range 221**] at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 563**] if there are any
questions.
2. The patient will need to be treated with IV vancomycin until
[**3202-10-25**]. He will follow up with his infectious disease doctor
on [**3202-10-14**], at which time the antibiotic course may need to be
modified.
3. While on vancomycin, the patinet will need to have weekly
labs, including CBC/diff, BUN, Cr, vancomycin trough, ESR, CRP.
Fax results to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 164**], infectious disease, fax
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 48**].
4. The patient was diagnosed with a urine tract infection on the
day prior to discharge. His urine culture is still pending, and
he is being treated empirically with IV ceftriaxone for 10 days
(last day = [**3202-10-19**]). Please call the microbiology lab at [**Hospital1 4**]
on [**3202-10-11**] to find out the results of the culture. The micro lab
can be reached at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7679**].
5. Check digoxin level on [**3202-10-16**] and adjust digoxin dose if
necessary.
6. PICC line care. Please discontinue PICC after IV antibiotics
are complete.
7. Daily dressing changes with silvedene for osteomyelitis of
right 4th toe amputation site.

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or
wheelchair.


Discharge Instructions:
You were came to the hospital with a change in your mental
status, low blood pressures, and kidney failure. You were
treated with hydration and antibiotics, with improvement in your
kidney function and mental status.
.
Your course was also complicated by bleeding from your GI tract.
You had an upper endoscopy and colonoscopy which showed some
irritation of your stomach, but did not show why you were
bleeding. It was thought that your dabigatran reached toxic
levels due to your kidney failure, causing you to bleed.
Dabigatran was restarted when your bleeding had resolved, your
endoscopies were negative, and your kidney failure had improved.
