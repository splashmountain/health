History of Present Illness:
Mrs [**Known patient lastname 1395**] is a 66 yo woman with ESRD on HD, c/b calciphylaxis,
afib on [**Known patient lastname **], who c/o generalized weakness x2-3 wks now
presents with tarry stools and hypotension.  Pt states that she
had a large, black, tarry BM this morning, then went to [**Known patient lastname 3292**]
today and was feeling weaker than usual, requiring help with
ambulating.  She was hypotensive and INR was found to be
elevated to 19, therefore she was referred to the ED for further
evaluation.  Pt [**Known patient lastname 3564**] other symptoms including fever, however
does state that she has had watery diarrhea 4x/day for the last
several days, also c/o decreased appetite.  She has also been
feeling lightheaded.  She [**Known patient lastname 3564**] changes in her diet recently
and does not think that she could have accidentally overdosed on
her [**Known patient lastname **].
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: 97.5 104 80/23 18 100% 4L

.
STUDIES:
CXR [**2858-7-2**]:
FINDINGS: Hilar prominence and interstitial opacities likely
reflect a degree of volume overload in the setting of renal
dysfunction. Double-lumen left-sided central venous catheter is
seen with tips at the cavoatrial junction and well within the
right atrium. Cardiac size is top normal with normal
cardiomediastinal silhouette. Unchanged right lung granuloma
again seen.
IMPRESSION: Mild volume overload
.
EGD [**2858-7-4**]:
Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential
complications were explained to the patient, who indicated her
understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms. A
physical exam was performed. A physical exam was performed prior
to administering anesthesia. Supplemental oxygen was used. The
patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and an
endoscope was introduced through the mouth and advanced under
direct visualization until the second part of the duodenum was
reached. Careful visualization of the upper GI tract was
performed. The vocal cords were visualized. The Z-line was noted
at 39 centimeters.The diaphragmatic hiatus was noted at 40
centimeters.The procedure was not difficult. The patient
tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications.
Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach: Normal stomach.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
.
Bone Scan ([**2858-7-8**])
IMPRESSION: 1. Possible calciphylaxis vs. poor radionuclide
washout in the
bilateral distal lower extremities. 2. No evidence of
calciphylaxis in the
breasts. 3. Moderate increased uptake in the lesser trochanter
of the left femur of uncertain etiology. 4. Stable heterogenous
uptake in the thoracolumbar spine also consistent with
degenerative changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
History:
66 yo woman with hx ESRD on HD, afib, presenting with weakness,
hypotension and melena concerning for GIB. INR at admission
found to be >19. Pt was admitted to the ICU s/p 6U transfusion.
Bleeding resolved with IV PPI. UGI endoscopy normal. Hct stable
for 10days. Hospital course c/b with calciphylaxis (lower
extremity) on sodium thiosulphate and [**Month/Day/Year **] (breast). Pain
management has been challenging. She has been on IV dilaudid
PCA, fentanyl patch and standing tylenol. D/ced to rehab on
Lovenox for anticoagulation, sodium thiosulfate for
calciphlaxis, po dilaudid, fentanyl patch and acetaminophen for
pain.

#. Calciphylaxis and [**Month/Day/Year **] Necrosis: Breast lesions biopy c/w
[**Month/Day/Year **] necrosis. Lower extremity lesions c/w with
calciphylaxis based on previus biopsy and bone scan. [**Month/Day/Year **]
stopped upon admission. Calciphylaxis managed on sodium
thiosulfate. This may need to be continued for another 6 weeks
or more. *Please order this medication ahead of time as there is
a national shortage(

#. Chronic pain: Pain management had been challenging throughout
hospital course. Pt continues to have pain despite 0.25-0.36mg
dilaudid PCA q6mins, with 12.5-100mcg/hr fentanyl patch, and
standing 1000mg tylenol q8hr/prn. Pain service and palliative
care both involved in her care. We will continue her on
gabapentin, tylenol 1000mg q8hr/prn, fentanyl patch 25mcg/hr
q3days, and po dilaudid 2-4mg q3hrs upon discharge to rehab. She
had been monitor for mental status and respiratory depression
closely with medication adjustment. Please hold dilaudid if
repiratory rate <10 or changes in mentation, or somnolance.
.
#. Afib, coagulopathy:
Held [**Month/Day/Year **] on admission given GIB and supratherapeutic INR,
which was reversed. [**Month/Day/Year **] was not restarted given [**Month/Day/Year **]
necrosis on the breasts. Additionally, she reportedly had an
adverse reaction to Plavix in the past. After much discussion
with patient, family, pharmacy and renal, we decided to start
her on Lovenox. The pharmacokinetics of this medication are
unclear in [**Month/Day/Year 3292**] (and obesity). Accordingly, she will be
dosed 80mg q48hr with trough anti10a monitoring prior to each
dose. Goal anti10a level between 0.2-0.4. If there are problems
running this test, please send test to [**Hospital1 4**].

#. Acute Blood Loss anemia due to GI bleeding:
Pt Hct drop of 15 points below most recent baseline. NGL in ED
was negative. However, pt had reported melena, concerning for
upper source. Elevated INR likely a contributing factor as
supratherapeutic to 19 on admission. Her INR was reversed with
FFP and vitamin K. She was transfused 2 units of units PRBC's in
the ED and an additional 4 units while in the ICU. She was also
started on IV PPI. GI was consulted, and EGD showed no active
bleeding, presumed due to PPI therapy. She was started on
Omeprazole 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and. Her Hct stabilized without any repeat
bleeding throughout the rest of her course.

#ESRD
Hemodialysis was continued with consultation by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1518**],
her nephrologist. Medications were renally dosed.

#Constipation
She was markedly constipated during her admission, finally
having multiple BM's with large doses of PEG as well as colace,
senna. This was due to the high-dose opiates she was receiving.

TRANSFER OF CARE
1. Continue sodium thiosulfate 3x a week 25mg IV over 30mins
with Zofran after HD for treatment of calciphylaxis.
2. Continue wound care the skin lesions to prevent
superinfection. Pt is at high risk for bacteremia and sepsis.
3. AVOID caustic [**Doctor Last Name 47**] and aggressive debridement of skin
lesions given risk of bleeding from underlying arterial source.
4. Continue to follow pain and titrate pain medication.
5. CLOSE MONITORING for mental status changes and respiratory
depression closely with pain medication adjustment.
6. Continue to monitor for rebleeding from GI tract while on
Lovenox.
7. Continue PO omeprazole and transition to daily upon discharge
from rehab or at next PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
8. Please hold dilaudid if repiratory rate <10 or changes in
mentation, and somnolance.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known patient lastname 1395**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you when you were admitted to
[**Hospital1 4**] for gastrointestinal bleeding. At admission, we found that
your INR was elevated at >19 and that your labs indicated that
you had significant blood loss. We stopped your Warfarin
(coudmadin), gave you blood, and treated you with intravenous
proton pump inhibitor for a suspected gastric ulcer. An
endoscopy was performed to assess the upper portion of your
intestinal tract, but did not find any source of bleeding. You
did not show any signs of further blood loss during your
hospital course, and your labs showed a stable hematocrit for
the past 10days.

The second issue during your hospital course was your skin
lesions on your Right breast and thigh. You had a biopsy of the
lower extremity lesions from [**Month (only) 89**], which showed calciphylaxis.
We also did a bone scan which was consistent with this
diagnosis. Dermatology team biopsied your right breast lesion
and found that it was consistent with [**Month (only) **] necrosis. There
had been extensive discussion on which anticoagulation regimen
we will send you home with. Since you are no longer able
tolerate [**Month (only) **] and have a history of adverse reactions to
plavix, we will discharge you on Lovenox for your
anticoagulation. We treated you with sodium thiosulfate for your
calciphylaxis, and you will continue on this as an outpatient.
Pain management and palliative care were both involved for the
management of your pain. We will send you to rehab with a pain
management plan below, which may be adjusted and titrated
according to your pain.

The medication we stopped upon your admission was:
1. Warfarin ([**Month (only) **]): we stopped this medication due to a
elevated INR, as well as your skin lesions that were consistent
with Warfarin necrosis.

Upon discharge the new medication you will be continued on are:
1. Lovenox 80mg every other day: this is a medication for
anticoagulation. You will have your blood draw before getting
the next dose to ensure that anti-10a level is within 0.2-0.4.
2. Sodium Thiosulfate:  you will get 25mg of this medication
after hemodialysis over a 30mins infusion period. You will
receive Zofran during this infusion. This medication may cause
hypotension, and you blood pressure should be monitored during
this infusion.
3. Fentanyl patch: you will go to rehab on 25mcg/hr of fentanyl
patch that should be changed every 3 days. Please stop the patch
if you feel lethargic, confused, or if your feel that you are
not breathing well. This may be changed at rehab.
4. Hydromorphone 2-4mg every 3 hrs: Please stop using it if you
feel sleepy, woozy, lethargic or confused. You respiration and
oxygenation needs to be monitored while on this medication. This
may be changed at rehab. This dose may be readjusted at rehab.
5. Senna, colace, miralax: these three medications are to help
you move your bowel while on the pain medications.
6. Sarna lotion and fexofenadine to help control your itching.

Other medication changes:
1. Gapapentin: we decreased this medication for 300mg qday. They
may decided to restart you on your outpatient night-time dose.
