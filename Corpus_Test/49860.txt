Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 351**]
Chief Complaint:
64 year old with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
status post pulmonary vein isolation now with palpitations on
dofetilide admitted for re-do pulmonary vein isolation -
complicated by perforated left atrial appendage requiring
emergent evauation of cardiac tamponade/ exploration/Maze


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Emergent mediastinal exploration and evacuation of
    pericardial tamponade and control of hemorrhage.
 Pulmonary vein isolation using the AtriCure
    bipolar RF system with resection of left atrial
    appendage.


History of Present Illness:
 This patient is a  64 year old
female with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation status post pulmonary
vein isolation by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9540**] at [**Doctor Last Name 3024**]Hospital on
[**2637-6-7**].
She has been doing well until recently when she was hospitalized
in [**Month (only) 201**] and [**Month (only) 51**] with episodes of symptomatic atrial
fibrillation.  During her [**Month (only) 51**] admission she was started on
dofetilide.  She continues to have intermittent palpitations on
dofetilide, but no prolonged episodes.  She was referred for
re-do pulmonary vein isolation.  On admission she complained of
palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigued, and feels clammy
when in atrial fibrillation with occasional lightheadedness.
Denies claudication, edema, orthopnea, PND

PA AND LATERAL CXR

Widened mediastinum has improved. Cardiomegaly is stable.
Pulmonary edema
has almost resolved. Bibasilar atelectasis, larger on the right
side, have
improved. Small bilateral pleural effusions have improved.
Sternal wires are
aligned. There is no evident pneumothorax

TEE
PRE-BYPASS: A small right-to-left shunt across the interatrial
septum is seen at rest which may represent the site of
transseptal puncture from the patient's pulmonary vein isolation
procedure.
There is mild-to-moderate ([**12-9**]+) tricuspid regurgitation.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. Mitral inflow velocity profile demonstrates
little to no respiratory variation.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion
appears circumferential. A catheter is seen within the effusion
with a thrombus at the tip.
There is sustained right atrial collapse, consistent with low
filling pressures or early tamponade. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified
in person of the results at time of surgery.

POST-BYPASS: The patient is on no inotropes. Biventricular
function is good.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is trivial mitral regurgitation.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation which is
unchanged from pre-bypass.
The aorta appears intact after removal of the aortic cannula.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 yr old female admitted s/p emergent repair of LAA perforation
(due to perforated left atial appendage in the cath lab during
redo pulmonary vein isolation) and MAZE on [**7-31**]. The surgery was
performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] please see intraop note for further
details. She arrived from the OR intubated on proprofol. She
weaned and extubated without difficulty by POD#1. Awoke
neurologically intact. She remained hemodynamically stable her
1st night, on POD#1 she had burst of a-fib and was restarted on
dofetilide. On POD #2 she transferred to floor in stable
condition. She was started on lopressor and lasix. Pacing wires
and chest tubes were removed in timely fashion. She had recieved
multiple blood products intraop and postop she was mildly
throbocytopenic. Her platlets have rebounded and she was
restarted on coumadin, her INR goal 2-2.5. She has been followed
by the EP service, her QTC has remained stable and at their
request she is to remain on protonix for one month post-op. She
was started on lasix and gently diuresed, her renal function has
remained stable. Her blood sugars were within normal range on
her preoperative dose of glucophage. She was seen by the PT
service and deem safe for discharge to home. ON POD#5 she was
cleared for discharge to home. All follow-up appointments were
arranged.
