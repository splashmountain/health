   Imaging: [**2-3**] CXR - portable AP CHEST: A faint outline of a peripheral
   line is visualized in the
   region of the right lower neck. The tip of the line likely projects
   over the
   right internal jugular vein although this is difficult to assess
   radiographically. Compared to the examination from three days prior
   there has
   been marked improvement in pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette
   remains
   mildly enlarged. The pulmonary vasculature is mildly prominent. There
   is no
   consolidation. Incidental note is made of the outline of a stent
   projecting
   over the left upper arm.
   Microbiology: Blood Cx [**2-3**] - NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 73F with PMH of ESRD on HD, PVD s/p bilateral BKA,
   DM, diastolic CHF presenting with hypotension.
   .
   #. Hypotension - Differential for hypotension includes hypovolemia vs.
   sepsis vs. primary cardiac event.  Of note, she is s/p recent
   hospitalization for volume overload with aggressive fluid removal;
   thus, most likely explanation is related to aggressive BP regimen and
   volume depletion.  She has no clear infectious source by lab data,
   imaging, or clinical exam.  AM labs, however, are notable for elevated
   troponin.
   - cycle cardiac enzymes.
   - Hold BP meds for now
   - IVF bolus as needed for MAP<65, currently stable
   - f/u micro
   - further antibiotics deferred for now
   # Elevated troponin:  Likely demand ischemia, but also must consider
   NSTEMI.  Patient had cath in [**12-26**] without obstructive disease.
   - TTE today to evaluate for wall motion abnormality
   - ASA 325 mg daily
   - continue Simvastatin
   - no indication for heparin as patient is currently anticoagulated with
   therapeutic INR on coumadin
   - resume beta-blocker in PM if tolerated by BP
   # CKD, stage V - Continued calcium acetate, sevelamer per home regimen.
   - Continue MWF schedule as outpatient
   - Goal for 1.5 L negative at HD today
   - appreciate Renal recs
   # DM2 - Continue home regimen of NPH 4U [**Hospital1 **] + sliding scale insulin
   # HTN:  BP meds (metoprolol, verapamil, valsartan, isosorbide)
   currently held following episode of hypotension.
   - Consider resuming beta-blocker if tolerated by BP.
   # Chronic diastolic CHF (LVEF >75%) - No evidence of volume overload
   - beta-blocker and [**Last Name (un) 223**] held
   - TTE today
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia  - continue simvastatin
   # Paroxysmal a-flutter s/p failed ablation with subsequent atrial
   fibrillation; on warfarin
   - Continue coumdain with goal INR [**1-21**]
   - Continue amiodarone for rate control
   - Resume CCB, beta-blocker for rate control once tolerated by BP
   # FEN - monitor lytes, cardiac/renal diet, bowel regimen
   #. PPx: Coumadin, PPI, bowel regimen
   # Access - REJ, R femoral line
   - d/c femoral line today
