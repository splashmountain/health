   IMPRESSION:
   1. Extensive bilateral consolidations, right more than left, of high
   density
   that might be consistent with multifocal hemorrhage. The differential
   diagnosis in the presence of renal failure might include vasculitis.
   Hemorrhagic pneumonia might be considered in appropriate clinical
   setup.
   2. Small left apical pneumothorax, most likely unchanged compared to
   prior
   chest radiograph.
   3. Bilateral grossly unchanged pleural effusions, high in density that
   might
   also contain an element of hemorrhage.
   4. Extensive coronary calcifications.
   5. Still present contrast enhancement of kidneys and vicarious
   excretion of
   contrast the gallbladder consistent with known renal failure.
   85 year old woman with history of CAD s/p prior PCI, PVD, DM2
