   Assessment and Plan
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Assessment and Plan
   69 yo m with hx of sCHF, MVR, and Tricuspid ring, PAF, admitted to [**Hospital1 2208**]
   with elevated INR and acute exacerbation of systolic heart failure with
   lasix driven diuresis limited by persistent hypotension. Was initially
   admitted to CCU for ionotrope assisted diuresis but diuresed 7.8 L
   during his ICU stay on lasix gtt alone. Now, having further problems
   with diuresis on the floor and being transferred to the CCU again from
   inotrope-assisted diuresis.
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient is in the midst
   of a prolonged hospitalization for acute on chronic systolic heart
   failure. Clinically, he appears volume overloaded, with pitting edema
   in the lower extremities and elevated JVP. Of note, his lungs are
   relatively clear on exam. His most recent echo shows an EF of <20%. His
   current weight is 157 lbs, which is up from his self-reported dry
   weight of 135 lbs. He is currently being transferred to the CCU for
   intotrope-assisted diuresis.
   - will continue current regimen of 20mg/hr lasix gtt as has had
   favorable response.
   - consider adding milrinone for inotropic support if UOP does not
   improve with lasix
 no need for inotropy thus far
   - consider adding pressors for BP support if necessary
   - continue digoxin to further augment contractility
   - continue metolazone [**Hospital1 **] to help with diuresis
   - continue captopril
   - strict I/O's and daily weights, with goal of maximum diuresis as BP
   will allow
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while diuresing, repleting aggressively given ectopy
   - Low sodium diet with 1L fluid restriction
   - no ICD, per patient wishes
   - consider viability study this week to look for any treatable
   ischemia; will d/w with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   - consulting Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to come evaluate the pt today
   # Runs of Vtach: Per signout from cardiology floor team, the patient
   has been having frequent runs of nonsustained Vtach. Of note, the
   patient has expressed that he does not wish to have an ICD, as he
   requires frequent MRI's because of his h/o pancreatic cysts.
   - Monitor telemetry
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while diuresing
   - Aggressive K repletion with IV and PO
   # Paroxysmal AFib: Patient currently in atrial fibrillation.
   Uncontrolled rate could place a role in HF exacerbation; however, pt
   currently with normal HR. Beta blocker on hold [**3-19**] bradycardia.
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   - metoprolol on hold, as above
   - digoxin for rate control
   - continue coumadin for INR goal of [**3-20**]
   - repeat ECG
   # Acute Renal Failure: Recent baseline Cr has been ~1.2 to 1.5. Pt
   presented this hospitalization with a Cr of 2.2, likely from poor
   forward flow. With diuresis, the patient's Cr improved to 1.1, now
   increased to 1.6 - poor forward flow vs. ATN. FeUrea of 27 is
   suggestive of a prerenal etiology
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - will obtain urine lytes
 FeUrea 27
   - Add on sediment/eos
   # Hyponatremia: ? hypervolemic hyponatremia in the setting of fluid
   overload.
   - diuresis as above
   - fluid restriction as above
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Microcytic Anemia: Per primary team notes, patient with falling Hct
   from admission. Source not clear. Pt has reportedly been guaiac
   negative. Hct recently has been stable.
   - continue to guaiac stools and trend Hct
   - maintain active type and screen
   # Thrombocytopoenia: Stable. Per primary team notes, HIT and ITP ruled
   out; might be due to marrow suppression.
   - continue to trend platelets
   - platelet count not low enough for bleeding complications at this
   point but will be cautious of complications if platelet count continues
   to drop
   # Bioprosthetic Mitral Valve: Goal INR [**3-20**]. Currrently at goal (INR =
   2.6.
   - continue coumadin
   - continue to trends coags
   # Cholestatic Transaminitis: likely due to hepatic congestion.
   Improving. Benign abdominal exam.
   - continue to trend LFT's
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue home atorvastatin
   Diet: Low salt, cardiac heart healthy
   PIV: PICC, 20 guage.
   Code status: Full, confirmed with patient
   Dispo: CCU for now
