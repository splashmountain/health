Pertinent Results:
[**2704-7-18**] Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography in this right
dominant system demonstrated three vessel coronary artery
disease.  The LMCA was without angiographic evidence of
stenosis.  The LAD was a long vessel that wrapped around the
aped.  There was a long 70% stenosis in the proximal and mid
LAD.  The LCX had a 90% occlusion prior to a small caliber LPL
branch.  The RCA was of anterior origin and had diffuse 80% mid
and distal stenosis. 2. Resting hemodynamics limited to the
central aortic pressure revealed normotension (130/70mmHg).
There was no evidence of gradient across the aortic valve on
carefull pullback of the angled pigtail catheter from the left
ventricle to the ascending aorta. 3. Left ventriculography
revealed no mitral regurgitation.  The LVEF was calculated to be
65% with no evidence of wall motion abnormalities.
[**2704-7-21**] Echo: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen
in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body
of the right atrium/right atrial appendage. A patent foramen
ovale is present. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size,
and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with normal free wall contractility.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. After
coronary graft was placed, there were no gignificant changes
noted. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results
in the operating room at the time of the study.

Conclusions
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is
present. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. with normal free wall contractility. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. Trivial mitral

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was brought to the cath lab on
[**7-18**] where he was found to have multi-vessel coronary artery
disease. Cardiac surgery was consulted as was appropriately
worked-up for minimally invasive bypass surgery. On [**7-21**] he was
brought to the operating room where he underwent a minimally
invasive coronary artery bypass graft x 1. Please see operative
report for surgical details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24
hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated. On post-operative day one he was transferred to
the telemetry floor for further care. Chest tube was removed per
protocol.  The patient made excellent progress post-operatively.
 On Monday, [**2704-7-25**] he was taken to the cath lab where he
received a stent to the right coronary artery.  He was observed
overnight without incident.  He was discharged to home with VNA
services on POD 5.
