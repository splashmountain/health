   TTE-The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is
   seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
   normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %)
   with global hypokinesis and akinesis the infero-lateral wall. There is
   no ventricular septal defect. with moderate global free wall
   hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. A bioprosthetic
   aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears
   well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
   gradients. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but
   cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
