TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:  SOB
   HPI:
   Please see [**Hospital1 11616**] admission note for full details.
   Ms. [**Known patient lastname 749**] is a 68F with a PMH s/f COPD (frequent exacerbations), who
   presents with one week of worsening cough and shortness of breath. The
   patient reports that she has a chronic cough, of seven months duration
   since her valve surgery, which is usually a dry hacking cough. This
   cough, she states, has been evaluated at length without clear etiology.
   Since Monday (~4 days ago), she has had new onset, gradually worsening
   dyspnea, described as a feeling that "I can't catch my breath", and a
   more productive cough. She states sputum is clear/black. ROS is notably
   positive for congestion, wheezing, occasional paroxysmal nocturnal
   dyspnea, and new three pillow orthopnea (over the past week). Her ROS
   is notably negative for myalgias, sore throat, chest pain, LE edema,
   nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. She does note improvement in symptoms
   after nebulizers at home and felt her Cough improved after antibiotics
   were started. She has had sick contacts in her grandchildren, but
   thinks that they did not have the flu (they were all vaccinated for
   both seasonal and H1N1). Her PCP started her on moxifloxacin on one day
   prior to admission for "bronchitis".
   .
   In the emergency department presenting vital signs were T=101.2,
   BP=153/71, HR=134, RR=31, O2sat=83%RA. On exam, the ED resident reports
   that she had diffuse wheezes. She was treated with albuterol/ipatropium
   nebs, 125mg IV solumedrol, and levofloxacin. Her O2 sats improved to
   100% on 2L and she appeared more comfortable. Labs were notable for a
   creatinine of 1.6 (baseline 0.9), and a leukocytosis of 16.6. Urine and
   blood cultures were not sent. A CXR showed no consolidation, though the
   film was of poor quality.
   .
   On the floor, the patient was continued on levaquin to treat a RUL
   pneumonia, and was started on IV Methylprednisolone and had a 2-3L NC
   oxygen requirement.  Patient had continued to improve through the
   morning of [**12-5**], but soon became tachypneic to the mid-30s, and was
   placed on NRB.  ABG obtained was 7.49/40/69/31.  Patient had difficulty
   speaking in complete sentences and was transferred to the MICU for
   further management.
   .
   On arrival to the MICU, patient was breathing more comfortably and was
   able to speak in full sentences.  The patient was weaned to 2L NC and
   was started on Nebs and IV Methylprednisolone.  The patient denied any
   Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain, shortness of breath.  ROS
   otherwise negative.

   Assessment and Plan
   68F with h/o COPD who presents with COPD exacerbation and RUL
   Pneumonia.
   .
   #. Respiratory distress:  Acute Decompensated COPD Exacerbation with
   RUL Pneumonia.  In the acute setting, the patient received Lasix 20mg
   IV (unclear how much she diuresed to this), but was breathing
   comfortably on transfer to the ICU.  The patient was treated for two
   days with tamiflu, but was discontinued after a negative DFA for
   Influenza.  The patient is able to complete full sentences and does not
   appear to be labored in her breathing.  Repeat ABG shows
   7.44/43/87/30.
   - Solumedrol 125mg IV q8hrs
   - Broaden coverage to Vanc/Ceftaz/Azithro
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium nebs
   .
   # RUL Pneumonia:  Likely community acquired PNA.  Patient with
   worsening RUL infiltrate on quinalone antibiotic.  As patient has
   failed therapy, will broaden coverage.
   - Switch to Vanc/Ceftaz
   - Start Azithro for atypical coverage
   - Send Sputum culture
   .
   #. Acute kidney injury- Likely pre-renal etiology.  Cr 1.5, b/l
   1.3-1.5.
   - Patient has been improving with fluids, will monitor for now.
   .
   #. H/o paroxsymal atrial fibrillation:  Currently in NSR.  The patient
   had previously been anticoagulated, but was discontinued 3 months ago,
   unclear reason why.  CHADS2 score is 2.
   - Continue metoprolol and diltiazem
   - Continue ASA 325mg daily
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia - continue simvastatin
   .
   #. Hyperthyroid- toxic multinodular goiter- continue methimazole
   .
   FEN: NPO for now, will restart cardiac diet if patient is stable this
   evening
