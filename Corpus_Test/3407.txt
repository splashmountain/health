1) N/V/D -- likely viral gastroenteritis, resolved with
supportive care.  Unfortunately, iatrogenic CHF exacerbation
after aggressive fluid resucitation.  See the following course.

2)Respiratory Distress: Transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] from the floor
for acute worsingin hypoxia.  Acute pulmonary edema s/p fluid
hydration for viral gastroenteritis in baseline severe pulmonary
HTN (worse on ECHO from [**6-6**], 75 to 90 mm Hg), +/- worsening pulm
HTN, +/- PNEUMONIA.  Improved over several days with diuresis
and BIPAP use.  Transferred back to 11 [**Hospital Ward Name 1804**] when she became
stable on nasal canula.  Slowly weaned to baseline home oxygen
requirement of 4 liters.  Additionally treated with Zosyn for
concern of hospital acquired pneumonia, but unconvincing
clinical picture without fever or elevated WBC.  Zosyn was
discontinued 24 hours prior to discharge without event.  The
pulmonary team consulted regarding her pulmonary hypertension,
and recommended avoiding afterload reduction and possible future
evaluation for OSA.  Pt refused BiPAP repeatedly and an
evaluation was deferred until she may be more compliant with the
treatment.

3)CHF EXACERBATION [**Hospital 15578**] transfer to the ICU, was diuresed
with a lasix gtt with improvement in symptoms. 02 sats 91-95% on
6L, up from her 4Lbaseline.
-spent several days in the unit getting diuresed.  Lasix was
held for about three days as patient creatine increased. her
respiratory status remained stable, bubble study was negative
for shunt. Ultimately patient was transferred back to the floor,
with pulmonary consult for consideration of interventions or
other treatments for her severe pulm HTN.
.
.
-creatine stabilized, home dose lasix was restarted without
event.
.
.
4)CKD: baseline cr 1.8 ~2.1, peaked at 2.4 after diuresis.
diuresis was held, patient continued to have good urine output.
cr returned to baseline, was 1.7 on discharge.
.

5)ATRIAL FIBRILLATION -rate controlled in 60s. metoprolol and
amiodarone was continued per her home dosing.  The ICU team
inquired about her [**Hospital **] status, and after discussion
with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] it was deemed [**Name10 (NameIs) **] is
contraindicated due to her past history of hemorrhagic stroke.
.
7)Hypothyroidism: levothyroxine continued.
