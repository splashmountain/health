   Assessment and Plan
   81M with significant heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP and possible femoral line
   infection.
   .
   PLAN:
   ====
   Septic Shock/Hypotension: Resolved hypotension. Pneumonia as probable
   source with concurrent hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  Patient was
   addressed with River
s Early Goal Directed Therapy. Admisison lactate
   was not obtained in ED. APACHE IV score was  114 with a predicted
   mortality of 77%.  Legionella urinary Ag negative. Sputum culture gram
   negative rods and gram positive cocci in pairs. Patient was volume
   resuscitated and came off pressors on [**3-14**]. Completed course of
   azytromycin.  C diff negative, no diarrhea. Patient was zosyn for 9
   days until got VAP.
   - patient to complete 14 day course of vancomycin on [**3-24**].
   .
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: from VAP from retained partial dentures.
   Likely due to pulmonary infiltrates.  Patient with elevated WBC counts
   and infiltrates on CXR. ARDS secondary to PNA. Initially improving and
   now worsening because of possible VAP. Zosyn and meropenem stopped
   [**3-19**]. restarted meropenem on [**3-21**] bc worsening hypotension and sepsis
   -Patient has been on Vancomycin. Tobramycin was discontinued on [**3-19**]
   but given worsening of patient, tobra restarted [**3-20**] for likely VAP.
   VAP grew out citrobacter freundii sensitive to tobra/meropenem. Repeat
   cultures same citrobacter. Differential includes leukocytosis caused by
   infected HD line in femoral vein. Will complete 8 day course of
   tobra/meropenem.
    - cont tobra/meropenem, will continue until [**3-27**].
   - cont PSV 12/5 trials, currently on PSV 17/5
   - IP will trach/PEG on Tuesday ( will notify of severe anemia and
   complication in transfusion)
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia.
   -          will notify IR for line placement and IP for [**Female First Name (un) 1120**] placement
   -          will give iron now
   Mental Status: awake, following commands. Initially, mental status did
   not immediately return once sedation removed because of shock liver and
   decreased metabolism of sedatives on initial presentation.
   .
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platlets stable, no evidence of DIC.
   - following daily
   - stool guaiac negative
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   - will con
t to monitor
   CV: this does not appear to be ACS, although CK markedly elevated.
   Most likely due to strain in setting of hypovolemia.  Patient without
   EKG changes and anticipate increased Tn.
   CAD: CABG [**2501**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, hold BB given
   sepsis.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors.
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2515**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   Anuric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Patient was
   given CVVH through L femoral line then HD. Renal pulled fem HD line
   with resolution of leukocytosis, tip culture pending, but could suggest
   line infection.
           - Last HD [**3-21**]
   - place IR HD line on Tuesday with VIP port, non-tunnelled since still
   spiking ( will notify of severe anemia and complication in transfusion)
   - renal given a dose of EPO, will discuss with renal re additional EPO
   given transfusion problems and severe and worsening anemia
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Tube feeds at 70cc/hr, at goal
   FEN
 tube feeds through OG tube
