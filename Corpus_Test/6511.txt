Reports:
[**3253-5-30**] Echo: Large pericardial effusion with invagination of
right atrial wall and no doppler signs of suggestive of
tamponade effects. These ar early signs of pericardial
tamponade. Post pericardial window, small effusion with normal
biventricular systolic function.
.
[**3253-6-1**]: No pneumothorax.  Previously noted possible
pneumothorax was
likely artifact.  Worsening atelectasis of retrocardiac left
lower lobe and a small left pleural effusion.  Right lung clear.

.
[**3253-6-4**] Liver: 1) No discrete hepatic lesion identified.  Biopsy
therefore not performed. 2)  Right pleural effusion.
.
Bronchial Washing:
Pleural Fluid: ATYPICAL. Rare atypical epithelioid cells -
cannot exclude carcinoma; numerous pulmonary macrophages,
bronchial epithelial cells, and squamous cells.
Bronchial Brushing:
Bronchial brush: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Numerous
bronchial epithelial cells, squamous cells, and some pulmonary
macrophages.
.
[**3253-6-5**] MRI,MRA head/neck: 1.  Evolving subacute infarction in
the left posterior cerebral artery territory.  Small regions of
hemorrhagic transformation.
2.  No aneurysm, significant stenosis, or occlusion of the major
vessels of the head and neck.
.
[**3253-6-5**] MR thoracic spine:1.  Likely metastatic lesion in the
right side of the T12 vertebral body extending into the pedicle
and lamina, as well as extending into the epidural space.  No
evidence of signal abnormality in the thoracic cord.
2.  Areas of signal abnormality in the T3, T7, and T10 vertebral
bodies are most consistent with hemangiomas when correlated with
the bone scan and CT findings.
3.  Bilateral kidney cysts.  Please correlate with abdominal
imaging.
4.  Incompletely visualized left-sided lung masses, and
reference should also be made to the CT of the torso for further
evaluation of these.
.
[**3253-6-10**] CT Chest:
CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Non-dependent loculated left
pleural effusion has evolved in the interval. Another area of
loculated effusion is seen anteriorly in the left lung as well.
In the left lower lobe, there are multiple peripheral masses.
These are unchanged from the prior study. One of these has a
small calcification (3, 32). These measure up to 1.8 x 1.7 cm
(3, 34). In the left upper lobe, there are two nodules measuring
1.4 x 1.6 cm, and a larger mass measuring 2.1 x 2.6 cm (3, 16).
New areas of ground-glass rounded opacities are seen in the
right upper lobe (3, 24) measuring up to 11 mm in size. Multiple
smaller nodules are seen bilaterally measuring 2-3 mm in size.
Nodule in the right lower lobe measures 9 mm (3, 45). Large
pericardial effusion is unchanged.
Evaluation for mediastinal and hilar adenopathy is limited on
this non- contrast study. No enlarged hilar nodes are seen.
There is no pneumothorax.
CT ABDOMEN: Evaluation of intra-abdominal organs is limited due
to the lack of intravenous contrast. Given this limitation,
there is no renal stone seen on either side. The spleen,
gallbladder, pancreas, and loops of bowel are grossly normal. No
enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph nodes are present.
Small areas of low density in the liver are incompletely
characterized but present in the left [**Last Name (un) **] (6 mm [**3-/3197**]) and in
the right lobe ([**3-/3200**] two small lesions and a small lesion on
[**3-/3202**]). Small low density lesions in the interpolar region of the
right kidney are simple cysts.
CT PELVIS: The bladder is not distended. There is no free fluid
in the pelvis. Sigmoid colon is collapsed.
BONE WINDOWS: Destruction of the vertebral body at T12 is again
noted, as seen on a recent thoracic MR study of [**3253-6-5**].
REFORMATTED IMAGES: Multiplanar reformatted images in the
coronal and sagittal planes confirm the above findings.
IMPRESSION: Multiple pulmonary masses and nodules in this
patient with prior history of breast cancer and destructive
lesion of right T12 vertebral body extending into the foramen
and spinal canal at this level.
.
[**3253-6-10**] Echo: Conclusions:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is a small to moderate sized circumferential pericardial
effusion without evidence of
hemodynamic compromise.
.
[**3253-6-11**] CT Head: FINDINGS:
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Evolving left posterior cerebral territory infarct, in the
subacute stage, is noted with gyriform enhancement.
No abnormal foci of enhancement are noted in the brain
parenchyma elsewhere, to suggest metastatic disease. The
visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses are clear.
No osseous lytic or sclerotic lesions are noted.
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Evolving left PCA territory subacute infarct.
.
[**3253-6-12**] T12 biopsy:
FNA, T12 Vertebral Body:
POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent with metastatic
poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma.
.
[**3253-6-19**] CXR: The right internal jugular line was inserted with
its tip terminating about 1 cm below the cavoatrial junction.
The heart size is enlarged due to known pericardial effusion,
unchanged compared to the recent previous study. The left lower
lobe atelectasis and known left upper lung masses and nodules
are unchanged. The chronic left fourth rib fracture is again
noted.




Brief Hospital Course:
Discharge Summary:
# Pericardial Effusion: As mentioned in the HPI, Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] was
transferred from OSH with a pericardial effusion. Upon admission
she had an Echocardiogram which showed a large pericardial
effusion with early tamponade physiology. She was then
emergently taken to the operating room where she underwent a
pericardial window. Please see operative report for surgical
details. Following surgery she was transferred to the CSRU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours she was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
On post-operative day one she required transfusion of pRBC d/t
low HCT. She was started on beta blockers in the setting of new
onset Atrial Flutter and gentle diuresis was initiated. Oncology
was also consulted for possible metastatic disease vs primary
lung cancer.  On post-op day three her chest tube was removed
and she was transferred to the telemetry floor for further care.
On post-operative day four she was transferred to the medical
service for continued care.  Pericardial window tissue culture-
no growth, cytology: No malignancy identified.  However, on CT
Torso done on [**6-10**], pericardial effusion was noted and reported
as unchanged.  A stat bedside echo was done which showed a small
to moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion without
evidence of hemodynamic compromise.  Pulsus remained between
[**8-22**] and she was monitored closely.  Repeat echocardiogram on
[**6-16**] showed stable pericardial effusion.  No signs/symptoms of
tamponade on exam.
.
# Metastases: On the medical floor, pt had an extensive work up
of her metastatic disease without a known primary. The CT scans
at the OSH show multiple metastic lesions in lungs,
spine(T6/11/12), and small lesion in liver. The heme/onc service
was consulted and recommended bone scan, tumor markers, and a
biopsy of tissue for diagnosis. Pt had tumor markers checked -
CA 27.29: 43, CEA: 13.  Pt had Bone scan [**3253-6-4**] which showed
lesions in L1 vertebral body and right posterior 5th rib
concerning for metastatic disease. She had an MR thoracic spine
shows T 12 met which does not break into cord, no conus or cord
involvement seen. The interventional pulmonology service was
consulted and attempted a biopsy of her lung mass. However the
pathology results were indeterminate.  Bronchial washings did
show Rare atypical epithelioid cells - carcinoma could not be
excluded. Interventional radiology was consulted for CT guided
transthoracic biopsy, however, when the patient went down for
the procedure she was noted to be tachycardic and had INR of
1.5.  Due to risk of PTX in unstable patient, the procedure was
deferred.  Imaging of the T spine was reviewed with
Neuroradiology who felt that tissue could be obtained from the
T12 lesion.  On [**6-12**], neuroradiology performed biopsy of T12
lesion.  Tissue was sent for receptor staining.  Receptor
staining did not reveal the primary.  Oncology was involved
throughout and based on the patient's other illnesses there were
no available treatment options.  A family meeting was held on
[**3253-6-19**] to discuss goals of care.  The patient was made DNR/DNI
and expressed that she would like to be moved to a nursing home
facility/hospice for further care.  Palliative care has also
been involved while in house.
.
# s/p CVA: On the medical floor, pt was noted to have visual
field defects. Pt had a CT of her head with a subacute infarct
in the region of PCA- 4x6cm left occipital lobe. No metastasis
were noted on CT.  The neurology service was consulted and
recommended MRI/MRA of her head which showed vessels in the neck
without stenoses, subacute infarct again visualized in region of
PCA.  Pt had had recent TEE without signs of endocarditis and a
repeat TTE which did not show clots. Pt had a lipid panel which
showed LDL <70 without medications, ASA 325mg was continued.
The issue of anticoagulation came up with regard to atrial
fibrillation as well as discovery of segmental PEs.  A repeat CT
head showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage and an evolving
left PCA territory subacute infarct.  Per neurology
recommendations, heparin gtt was started with low goal and close
monitoring of mental status.  Neuro exam remained unchanged.

# Optic neuropathy: Ophthalmology service was also consulted,
possible retinal metastasis was visualized and it was determined
that pt needed further retinal evaluation.  She was seen in
house by Ophthomology.  An MRI orbit was done.  Report attached.
.
# C. diff: With regard to her C.difficile colitis- pt was
initially continued on Flagyl, however, her white count
continued to trend up. PO Vancomycin was added to her antibiotic
regimen and her white count remained stable.  Diarrhea improved
on abx.  Antibiotics were continued for C. diff as she remained
on abx for pneumonia.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: With regard to her paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation she had episodes of RVR in the 140's. She was
initally rate controlled with Metoprolol but continued to have
episodes. PO diltiazem was added to her regimen.  On [**6-10**], she
was started on a diltiazem drip with minimal improvement in
rate.  Cardiology was consulted on [**6-11**] and recommended starting
amiodarone drip.  She converted to normal sinus rhythm on [**6-11**].
Medications were changed to PO.  She remained on PO amiodarone
(weaned from 400 [**Hospital1 **] to 200 [**Hospital1 **]) and beta blockers (weaned to
25mg TID [**2-14**] low BP) with heart rates in the 100s-110s.  She was
asymptomatic with rapid heart rates.
.
# Pleural effusion: With regard to her Left pleural effusion-
lasix IV prn was used for diuresis.  She underwent thoracentesis
in an effort to help tachypnea - but removing fluid did not
improve RR or O2 sat.  She continued to require 4-5L O2.

# PNA: Due to some fevers and elevated white count, there was
concern for PNA.  Ground glass opacities were seen in RUL
representing possible infection so she was started on
Zosyn/Vancomycin, switched to Unasyn from Zosyn on [**6-12**].
