 ARTERIAL LINE - START [**3057-11-25**] 03:30 PM
   Neurology service was consulted yesterday and pt was started on
   propofol per their recommendations.  They will return to complete full
   neuro exam off propofol.
   Pt had EEG this morning to assess for subclinical seizures and
   encephalopathy.
   Aspirin was stopped and A-line placed yesterday.  Pt was able to be
   weaned from vent and was on PS yesterday, switched to AC to rest
   overnight, then back to PS this morning.  Pt is currently agitated off
   propofol.

   Echo [**3057-11-24**]: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to severe
   global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %) with somre preserved
   contraction of the basal inferolateral and anterolateral walls. Tissue
   Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are
   consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
   structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
   moderate ([**12-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most
   likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Global left ventricular cardiomyopathy. Moderate diastolic
   dysfunction with elevated filling pressures. Mild to moderate mitral
   regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
   Assessment and Plan
   64F with history of idiopathic CM presenting on transfer after vfib
   arrest.  Now with difficulty extubating.  Neurologic status appears
   unchanged; pt sometimes follows commands and at times does not.
   # CORONARIES:  No known CAD with cardiac cath in [**7-29**] showing no flow
   limiting lesions.   Given this will likely not require catheterization.
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   - no aspirin because coronaries are clean
   # PUMP:  Echo is consistent with both diastolic and systolic heart
   failure with an EF of 30%.    Per OP provider, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has Class II HF at
   baseline, thus no BiV pacer needed.   Etiology of heart failure is
   unknown. No indication for spironolactone.  Digoxin was considered but
   pt was felt to be in compensated HF at this time and no need to start
   at this point.
   - Losartan 50mg PO qday
   - Lasix 20mg QD maintenance
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   - Will get ICD before d/c pending Neuro evaluation
   # RHYTHM:  Vfib noted on EMS tracings.  Shocked back into sinus.  Now
   on carvedilol, sinus.
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   - ICD as above.
   # Pulmonary.  Failed RSBI yesterday, this morning with copious
   secretions, agitation.  Concern that pt will not be able to protect
   airway if extubated.  Discussed with family, and they would like her to
   be reintubated if extubation fails.
   - Continue Zosyn for now, given concern for PNA with GNR in sputum
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - does not appear to be in pulmonary edema, will continue with home
   Lasix of 20mg PO qday
   - scopolamine patch
   - stop propofol prior to neuro exams
   # NEURO:  Improved significantly since arrival (see above for exam
   findings), but is unchanged from yesterday.  Contact[**Name (NI) **] Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 282**] to further evaluate anoxic brain injury, Neurology will see.
   - f/u neuro consult
   - f/u EEG
   # ANEMIA:  Known to have iron deficiency anemia; recieved one unit of
   pRBC at OSH.   HCT stable, pt asymptomatic, since unlikely ischemic in
   origin will not transfuse.  Retic hypoproliferative.  Fe studies as OP
   to w/ up further.
   - Guaiac stools
   - will hold on transfusion as pt does not have ischemic cardiac
   disease, hemodynamics stable.  Continue to monitor
   FEN: 1.5L fluid restriction; start tube feeds today with IVF for
   maintenance (D5 1/2NS)
   ACCESS: PIV X 1, arterial line
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   CODE: Full code for now, continued discussion with family
   DISPO: CCU until extubation.
