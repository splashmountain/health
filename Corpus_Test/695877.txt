   - GI push enteroscopy: A mass of malignant appearance was found at the
   lower third of the esophagus. The mass was friable and bleeding
   spontaneously on contact. The scope traversed the lesion. Normal mucosa
   was noted in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum up to 120 cm from the
   incisors, likely in distal jejunum. No evidence of bleeding was noted.

   63 y/o F w/ decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted
   diuresis, with ICU course c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, superimposed sepsis, GI bleeding requiring transfusion,
   persistent pressor requirement now found to have likely malignancy on
   push enteroscopy.
   .
   GI malignancy: Pt  continues to have persistent [**Last Name (LF) 7332**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   esophagus as well as evidence of GI malignancy. Transfused 9 units so
   far, last on 19^th. Discuss goals of care with family given new
   diagnosis.
   Plan for EGD for biopsy once acute bleeding stopped.
   In interim continue to trend crit. Currently stable. Daily Crit checks,
   transfuse for falling blood volume.
   Guiac all stools
   -hold anticoagulants if possible., currently on hep SC BID, with small
   amount of [**First Name3 (LF) 7332**] per flexiseal.
   Follow up GI recs
   Continue PPI
   .
   # Fluid overload/Congestive heart failure: Fluid overload likely
   multifactorial, related to hypoalbuminemia in addition to heart failure
   with EF worse.  Seems that most of the patient
s fluid is in the
   peripheral tissues secondary to low oncotic pressure. Was receiving
   fluid for hypernatremia. Albumin improved from 1.9 to 2.2
   -continue to address nutrition, replace NGT.
   - lasix GTT currently at 7.5, continue to diurese with lasix GTT
   Continue to diurese, goal negative 1-2L/day, with BP monitoring.
   -[**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Mental status has been persistently altered
   throughout patient
s admission. Non-contrast CT head [**3094-3-20**] showed
   extensive paranasal sinus disease, ?NP hydrocephalus, small radiolucent
   focus in left frontal bone. Consulted neuro on [**4-6**],  LP performed,
   pressure normal
possible NPH, elevated protein otherwise unremarkable.
   Gram stain negative, f/u cx, cytology
   - f/u neuro recs
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Due to inability to take PO and inadequate access to
   free water. Sodium currently wnl.
   Continue to trend.
   .
   .
   # S/p Dental Extraction: The patient presented with poor dentition. She
   underwent extraction of 24 teeth on [**3094-4-2**]. Culture of surgical
   specimen showing VRE and [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - continue to follow micro data/path for surgical specimens
   - routine post-operative mouth care
   - RTC Tylenol with morphine for breakthrough (morphine may be
   contributing to pt
s hypotension and AMS, so will try to avoid)
   .
   # MRSA Bacteremia; MRSA/Proteus in sputum: Pt treated with vanc as well
   as cefepime/flagyl. ID recommended 15 day course of cefepime/flagyl,
   which is complete. Recommending 21-day course of vanc for MRSA
   bacteremia.
   -  vanc x 21 day course (ended [**4-9**])
   .
   # CORONARIES:  CTO of proximal LAD.  CE's negative at OSH.
   - continue aspirin 81mg daily
   - continue zocor
   - holding on beta blocker and ACEi due to pressor requirement
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, occasional accelerated narrow complex rhythm w/o
   p-waves (?junctional), and NSVT. Pt did have VT/?VF last weekend and
   was shocked out of it by her ICD.
   - Continue amiodarone 200 mg TID for total 3
   weeks
   - continue
   telemetry
   - electrolyte repletion PRN, [**Hospital1 7**] electrolyte checks
   - contact her [**Name2 (NI) 254**] cardiologist ([**Name (NI) 1197**] [**Name (NI) 10046**]) to get more details
   re: her defibrillator and systolic function
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH elevated; however free T4 WNL.
