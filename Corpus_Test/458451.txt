   Assessment and Plan
   81 yom with h/o of ischemic heart disease, and CMY EF 15% with BiV
   pacer and ICD, p/w VT storm.
   # CORONARIES: H/o ischemic disease with multiple stents.  No
   revascularabile disease as of [**3450-1-3**]. Pt not having ischemic sx
   currently or recently.
   - ASA, BB, ACEI
   - continue exetemibe, lipitor
   - Trend CE
   # PUMP:  Pt has h/o generally well controlled cardiomyopathy.  He
   appears to be mildly volume overloaded based on pulmonary edema, but
   not requiring oxygen.  Will hold off on diuresis in acute setting given
   ectopy and risk of VT.
   - diurese in AM, follow I/Os
   # RHYTHM:  Pt has been in and out of NSVT with ATPs and or ICD
   cardioversion.  Cannot appreciate afib in setting of ectopy.  He
   continues to have significant ectopy since arrival, but is
   hemodynamically stable and has not rquired AT pacing.  He has begun
   bolus with amio at OSH and should continue with it.  He will likely
   require ablation tx in EP lab on Monday.
   - Continue Amio at 1mg/kg and reduce to 0.5mg/kg per standard bolus
   - baseline TSH, liver enzymes
   - replete electrolytes aggressively
   - ICD in place and functioning appropriately, pads in place
   - EP following
   - for afib, continue BB, coumadin, dig, follow dig levels
   #Chronic renal insufficiency - baseline Cr 1.6
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose medications
   # Htn: as above, continue BB, ACEI, can up titrate as needed
   # DM - hold glyburide, ISS
   # GERD: Cont PPI
   # Arthritis - Tylenol
   FEN: Cardiac, low sodium diet
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx, therapeutic on coumadin
   -Pain management with Tylenol
   -Bowel regimen with colace, senna.
