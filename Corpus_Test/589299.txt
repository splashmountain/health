   ABG: 7.44 / 33 / 137 /  / 0   Values as of [**2788-2-5**] 04:27 AM
   Tests
   ECG: (Date: [**2788-2-4**]), Sinus rhythm with atrial sensing and ventricular
   pacing. Compared to the
   previous tracing of [**2788-1-31**] heart rate is somewhat reduced. Otherwise,
   no major change.
   Echocardiogram: Carotids:
   Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid arteries.
   There is no significant plaque seen bilaterally.
   On the right peak velocities are 92, 95 and 98 cm/sec in the ICA, CCA
   and ECA
   respectively. This is consistent with no stenosis.
   On the left peak velocities are 84, 95 and 106 cm/sec in the ICA, CCA
   and ECA
   respectively. This is consistent with no stenosis.
   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes
   mellitus, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft [**9-19**], and AVR
   with abscess repair at aortic root [**3-20**], CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B
   Strep Endocarditis.
   .
   # Group B Strep Endocarditis, Prosthetic Aortic Valve
   - Does not appear that root is infected as this could be all
   postoperative change, though cannot be certain.
   - Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin for
   synergy. Switch to daily gent.
   - OSH Isolates pending for checking MIC
   - Bone Scan today to eval for osteomyelitis
   - For now pursuing with medical therapy as no hemodynamic compromise at
   present.
   # Infected Pacer Leads
   - Given large vegetations might be difficult to remove immediately.
   - Appreciate EP following, adjustment made to sensing to determine if
   temp wires would be needed if pacer wires removed.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 Resolved, on nasal cannula
   - Appreciate pulm recs
   - Consider CPAP given possibility of OSA if needed
   .
   # Anemia
 Likely BLOOD LOSS and INFLAMMATION as dual contributors
   - Gastroocult + NGT secretions, now on [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - Tranfusion support as needed
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 -
   - Transition to lantus and HISS pre-meal
   .
   # Septic Shock
 Shock resolved.
   .
   # B/L Foot Ulcers
 Bone Scan pending for today.
   .
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Improved
   .
   # FEN
 PO diet with modifications per speech & swallow service
   .
   # Access - R IJ and A line, can pull A line today.
   .
   # PPX - Heparin SC, PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Code - Full
   .
   # Dispo - Pending clinical improvement.
