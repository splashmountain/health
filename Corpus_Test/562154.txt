   Assessment and Plan
   68 year old female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy s/p
   resolution, htn, DM2 who presents with shortness of breath.
   .
   # SOB: Multifactorial. Given her presentation of acute shortness of
   breath, and recent weight gain w/increasing edema, the main concernf
   for etiology included DVT/PE, worsening heart failure secondary to
   ischemic event or pulmonary infection. On exam there is no evidence of
   infection other than in her urine. Cardiac enzymes are negative. On
   LENIs appears to have chronic DVT in popliteal vein on R. Started
   heparin drip night of admission.  CTA shows R lung PE and evidence of R
   heart strain.  Echo with preserved EF, NL RV size and free wall motion.
   Trival MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] evidence of right heart strain. Theory is that PE is
   subacute given increasing edema over last month. Increased heart
   strain, possible UTI exacerbated strain on heart causing development of
   new arrithymia and worsening SOB.
   - f/u CTA final read
   - supplemental O2, continue heparin and monitor coags
   - started coumadin 5 mg today, trend INR
   - hold antihypertensives given transient hypotension
   - treat heart block as below
   - d/ced azithro yesterday once clear lung process [**1-6**] PE. No longer
   feel PNA likely
   - cont CPAP at night
   .
   # hypotension: Known PE as above likely contributing. Sepsis from UTI
   unlikely given no other SIRS physiology. Cardiac event unlikely given
   neg CE.. Very unlikely to be secondary to sepsis given lack of white
   count, fever and clinically stable. Also this could be somehow related
   to her bradycardia and newly diagnosed 2^nd degree heart
   block/Wenkeboch.
   - treat possible CHF as above. Diuresis limited by low BP
   - On CTX for possible UTI but U cult NG so far, asymptomatic. Check
   Urine sediment today given overnight R flank pain (responded to
   Tylenol), if neg d/c CTX as completing 3 day course anyway
   - f/u sputum and urine cultures and f/u blood cultures
   - hold BP meds for now
   - IVF prn to maintain adequate MAPS, very preload dependent given PE.
   .
   # bradycardia/heart block: new Weinkeboch on ECG with 5:4 conduction,
   3:2 this AM. Differential of new heart block includes progression of
   calcific conduction system disease, ischemic event, valve abscess
   (which seems unlikely), and medications. If she is asymptomatic, she
   may not need further treatment for this. However if her current
   symptoms can be attributed to her bradycardia, then she may be a
   candidate for pacemaker. At this point, would work on ruling out other
   etiologies of her presenting symptoms before considering pacer.
   - tele monitoring
   - hold metoprolol and amitiptyline
   - if persistent, can consider EP consult
   .
   # UTI: evidence of UTI on U/A.  However, no leukocytosis or left shift.
   Has complained of urinary frequency.  U culture NG to date
   - ceftriaxone to be stoped after neg urine sediment.
   - f/u urine culture
   .
   # ARF: patient in mild ARF with slight increase in Cr and elevated BUN.
   Potential etiologies include worsening CHF due to bradycardia or other
   etiology, hypotension in setting of infection. Creatinine improved
   since admit with hydration overnight.
   -PO intake to avoid fluid overload
   - trend Cr
   - once BP, she may need lasix given her edema
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitis: on glipizide, raloxifene as outpt.
   - hold oral meds
   - ISS
   .
   # Obstructive sleep apnea: has been noncompliant in past with CPAP due
   to poorly fitting mask.

   assessment and plan.  She is therapeutic on heparin and we are starting
   coumadin. I think there are good reasons to consider life long anticoag
