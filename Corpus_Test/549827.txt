   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 50 year old male with recently diagnosed pilocytic
   astrocytoma s/p recent suboccipital carniotomy on [**10-5**] now with
   massive PE.
   .
   #) Elevated INR
   -          Due to overcorrection with warfarin combined with potential
   impaired metabolism with phenytoin recently discontinued. Suspect that
   effect of direct thrombin inhibitor has passed.
   -          Will treat with 5mg of PO vitamin K x1 to target INR <9
   given recent surgery and marked elevation
   -          As INR falls, will need to restart warfarin, consider
   restarting direct thrombin inhibitor if INR falls <3.
   -          Q8h coags
   -          Continue neuro checks q2h
   -          Appreciate heme following
   .
   #) PE: Bilateral PEs presumably from DVT and HITT, anticoagulated with
   argatroban gtt and transitioned to warfarin 2 days later with overlap.
   - covered by elevated protime now, follow closely.
   #) Generalized Pruritis:
   -          Witih excoriations, papules/uritcaria/dermatographia,
   temporally associated with argatroban. Primary team considering contact
   dermatitis
   -          Continue Antihistamine therapy
   # Thrombocytopenia: PLTs recovering into 300s
   .
   #)Pilocytic astrocytoma: Stable postoperatively.
   - Continue keppra
   - cont tylenol and oxycodone for pain control
   - recieved PT [**10-25**] and [**10-26**]. continue to have PT follow and prep for
   transfer to rehab
   #)Dry right eye/corneal abration. Per primary team: Continued inability
   to close R eye S/p repeat craniotomy. Using home Rx erythromycin
   ointment and artificial tears prn for dryness and itching. Wife bought
   eye patch [**10-27**] and pt using for diplopia prn (NOTE: patch ordered [**10-24**]
   but pt never received).
   - continue eye drops PRN for pain/dryness
   - continue eye patch PRN diplopia, changing sides periodically
   (~Q1-3H).
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: bowel meds prn, on heparin gtt, on PPI
   .
   #) FEN: p.o. diet as tolerated, aspiration precautions, ground solids
   with nectar thickened liquids, supervision with feedings, head turn to
   right with swallowing all liquids (see Sp/Swallow note);
   - continue aspiration precautions
   .
   #) Access: PIVs
