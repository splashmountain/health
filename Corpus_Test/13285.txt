Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 15230**]
Chief Complaint:
Generalized Tonic Clonic Seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left femoral venous line insertion.
Left PICC insertion via interventional radiology (twice).


History of Present Illness:
39 year old with [**Doctor Last Name **] encephalitis s/p partial L
hemispherectomy, refractory epilepsy s/p [**Doctor Last Name 15228**] placement, mental
retardation, s/p tracheostomy, who is transferred from her group
home for seizures. History excerpted from available OSH ED
records and telephone conversation with group home and Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **], her outpatient epileptologist.
.
Group home reports that pt. had a 1 minute generalized tonic
seizure at 7:30pm the day PTA, broken by swiping the vagal nerve
stimulator. At 8PM she had a 5 minute GTC, which also stopped
when they swiped her
[**First Name (STitle) 15228**]. Several minutes later she had a third GTC (3 minutes long),
and they gave a dose Phenobarbital. This was effective until 11
PM, when she started having her normal partial seizures (R eye
and R face twitching, R arm and leg tremors). She continued to
have these every 10 minutes overnight. They did not intervene on
these. This morning she had a fever of 99.6 axillary, and they
decided to transfer her to the ED in [**Hospital1 909**].
.
At [**Hospital1 909**] she had [**11-28**] brief episodes of R face and eye
twitching. She was given 15 mg PR Valium, and these episodes
ceased. She had no GTC there. She was noted to have a fever
there, so she was given CTX and Vancomycin. Dilantin level was
checked and was 4.4, so she was given 500 mg Fosphenytoin. Her
[**Month/Year (2) 15228**] magnet was swiped. She was transferred here for further
care.
.
Of note, she had been admitted at [**Hospital1 909**] recently after a
flurryof seizures. Her Dilantin was checked and was 35, and Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] felt that Dilantin toxicity, with pro-convulsant effects,
may be contributing, so her dose was lowered. It was rechecked
in follow up and was actually subtherapeutic, so dose was
increased again. It has not been rechecked since the last dose
change.

EEG Study Date of [**2742-9-29**]
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured three pushbutton
activations.
Along with the pushbutton activations, routine sampling and
spike and
seizure detection programs continued to show persistent and
frequent
spike and slow wave epileptiform discharges arising from the
entire left
hemisphere in a multifocal fashion. Rarely, these discharges can
be
repetitive and rhythmic and sustained for several seconds. In
addition,
there was persistent mixed theta and delta frequency slowing
seen over
the entire left hemisphere suggestive of an underlying
subcortical and
cortical dysfunction in that region.

EEG Study Date of [**2742-9-24**]
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured 10 pushbutton activations.
In
addition to the pushbutton activations, routine sampling and
spike and
seizure detection programs showed the presence of frequent spike
and
slow wave epileptiform discharges arising from the left
hemisphere in a
multifocal fashion. At times, these discharges were repetitive,
rhythmic, and sustained suggestive of ongoing electrographic
seizure
activity. In addition, there was persistent mixed theta and
delta
frequency slowing seen over the entire left hemisphere on top of
the
otherwise slow and disorganized background rhythm. The slowing
on the
left is indicative of cortical and subcortical dysfunction in
this
region likely due to structural or destructive process. The slow
and
disorganized background rhythm is consistent with
encephalopathy.

Echo [**2742-9-22**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5mmHg.  Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size  is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).  Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic  valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No  masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. There are filamentous strands on the aortic
leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.

EEG Study Date of [**2742-9-16**]
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence
of
frequent sharp and slow wave epileptiform discharges arising
from the
L>R temporal regions independently. In addition, there is
persistent
theta frequency slowing seen over the entire left hemisphere on
top of a
slow and disorganized background rhythm. Findings suggest
multifocal
potential areas for epileptogenesis. The focal slowing on the
left is
indicative of cortical and subcortical dysfunction in this
region. The
slow and disorganized background rhythm is consistent with
encephalopathy. There were no repetitive or rhythmic discharges
seen.
There were no electrographic seizures noted.

FDG BRAIN  [**2742-9-29**]
INTERPRETATION:
There is relatively increased [**Name (NI) 15231**] throughout the right
cerebral
hemisphere. The left hemisphere and cerebellum appear relatively
decreased in terms of FDG avidity. No focal areas of increased
uptake of FDG are present. There is a left parietal craniotomy
defect and evidence of a left
temporoparietal lobe resection. Ex-vacuo dilatation of the left
lateral
ventricle is consistent with remote resection. Mild shift of
normally midline structures to the left is also noted.
Physiologic FDG activity is present within the rectus muscles
bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: Unusual FDG brain scan showing asymmetric
hemispheric activity with the right cerebral hemisphere
significantly more active compared to the cerebellum and
remaining left cerebral hemisphere.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 39 year old woman with history of [**Doctor Last Name **]
encephalitis as a child who is status post partial L
hemispherectomy and now with longstanding refractory epilepsy,
s/p vagal nerve stimulator placement, mental retardation, s/p
tracheostomy, who was transferred from her group home with
episode of generalized tonic clonic seizure.

1) Seizure:
EEG revealed predominately left sided spike and wave discharges
with some evidence for improvement with addition and titration
of antiepileptic drugs. She continues to have right sided facial
trwitching, but does not have spread to her right arm. Trigger
was likely UTI, for which she initially received ceftriaxone.
She was then loaded with dilantin 1gm, and given additional
dosing for goal corrected level of 20. She was re-loaded with
phenobarbital for goal levels of 40-50. Zonegran was added with
evidence for clinical improvement in her episodes of
unresponsiveness. Continued control of her seizures may proceed
with the written protocol at her group home. Right facial
twitching may continue, however right arm twitching should be
treated with a swipe of her vagal nerve stmilator, and if no
resolution given an extra dose of valium, then consider
additional dose of phenobarbital. Given elevations in her serum
levels of epilepsy drugs and addition of zonegran she may have
transient alterations in her level of consciousness. Should
sedation become a long term problem, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] should be
contact[**Name (NI) **] to adjust her regimen accordingly.

She underwent PET/CT for further characterization of brain
function for consideration of further resection in the future
should secondary generalization continue to be refractory to
medical therapies.

2) Line sepsis:
Given difficult IV access and hypotension in the ED a femoral
venous catheter was placed on admission. She later developed
hypothermia and hypotension, with coagulase negative staph
growing from blood cultures taken from femoral line. She was
transferred back to the MICU and started on Vancomycin and
Cefepime. Sputum obtained via deep suction grew pseudomonas, but
this was not thought to be pathogenic. Echocardiogram did not
reveal any valvular vegetations or effusion. Her blood pressures
remained labile for 1 week following initial infection. There
was considerable variation in measurements- an arterial line was
attempted for invasive monitoring without success. Non-invasive
measurements were at times consistent and did improve with
stimulation such as deep suctioning of her tracheostomy. She did
not require IV fluid boluses for four days prior to discharge.
Her PICC line was discontinued prior to discharge.

3) Urinary Tract infection-
On admission UA weakly positive. Started on ceftriaxone, then
changed to cefpodoxime per G tube. She later was treated with
Cefepime and Vancomycin for her line infection, which is
excellent coverage for her UTI.
