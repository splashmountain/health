   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo male with COPD, MS, DM, CAD s/p ankle repair with post-op
   hypotension from acute blood loss anemia and UTI/SIRS
   1. Hypotension/anemia: still requiring resuscitation with fluids and
   blood
   *Transfuse an additional 2 units blood and continue to monitor hct
   *Hold lasix and BP medicines
   *Ortho to re-look at ankle
   2. Afib: Rapid rate improved with fluid/blood support
   3. Hypoxia: appears improved. Inaccurate [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 3937**] [**Location (un) **] may have
   explained his preivous low readings
