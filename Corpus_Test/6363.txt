Brief Hospital Course:
[**2777-8-12**]: Admitted to thoracic surgery service after
tracheobrochoplasty for tracheobronchomalacia. Was slightly
tachycardic in the PACU to 105, but asymptomatic and BP normal.
Admitted to ICU for respiratory status monitoring.  Thoracic
epidural function declined, likely paramedian. Epidural split to
bupivicaine with dilaudid PCA.

[**2777-8-13**]: Improved pain control with addition of Toradol.
Epidural with minimal effect. Patient stable and out of bed to
chair. No acute events. Right chest tube removed.

[**2777-8-14**]: No acute events, tolerating clears, epidural removed,
PCA dilaudid switched to intermittent IV dilaudid as patient was
highly sedated and had questionable respiratory drive.

[**2777-8-15**]: Foley catheter removed and IV fluids were stopped.
Tolerated full liquid diet. Given oxycontin for pain. Begun on
toradol for a 3 day period.  Dilaudid PCA restarted, and
lidocaine patch over the incision site was applied.  Given lasix
for diuresis, recent CXR showed mild fluid overload with a small
left sided pleural effusion.

[**2777-8-16**]: Continue diruesis given >3L positive yesterday -> lasix
20mg x1.  Transferred from the ICU to the floor.  Begun on a
regular diet, which she tolerated well.

[**2777-8-17**]: Has not taken topiramate during this admission.
Developed nausea after going down for a CXR.  Upon questioning,
pt sts she is somewhat dizzy and that this exact same problem
occured on her previous post surgical admission.  Likely
withdrawal from topiramate.  Begun on standing topiramate.
Morphine PCA stopped and oral morphine begun, with better pain
control.

[**2777-8-18**]: Mild pleuritic pain, O2 sat's stable, tolerating PO's
well, and pain is well controlled.  Was made NPO and placed on
IVF in preparation for bronchoscopy on [**2777-8-19**].

[**2777-8-19**] - Patient underwent flexible bronchoscopy, which was
within normal limits. She is alert, oriented, and ambulating
independently.

[**2777-8-20**]- Patient was afebrile, saturating 98% on room air, and
