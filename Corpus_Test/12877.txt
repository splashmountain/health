AGE:  57.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57-year-old
Caucasian female with past medical history significant for
coronary artery disease status post angioplasty of the LAD in
[**3321**], who now presents with acute chest pain consistent with
acute inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction.  The
patient reports being in good health until the morning of
[**7-1**], when she developed a headache and slight
discomfort between her shoulder blades.  This pain was
transient in nature and relieved by Advil.  Around 8 PM that
same day she developed crushing substernal chest pain,
nonradiating in nature, 10 out of 10 in intensity, more
severe then any chest pain she had had in [**3321**], associated
with diaphoresis, nausea, and arm heaviness bilaterally.  She
was taken to [**Hospital3 **] via ambulance and EKG there
revealed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 53 with normal axis
and intervals.  There was 1-mm ST elevations in all her
inferior leads, reciprocal ST depressions and T-wave
inversions in 1 and AVL.  As a result, she was given IV
nitroglycerin, heparin, morphine, and Aspirin and she was
immediately given [**Location (un) 2045**] to [**Hospital1 1499**] for emergent catheterization.  Cardiac catheterization
demonstrated total occlusion of her distal right coronary
artery and three stents were placed without any
complications.  She was then admitted to the Coronary Care
Unit for overnight observation.  She arrived on the unit in
stable condition and without any complaints.  She denied any
chest pain, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath,
diaphoresis, jaw pain, arm pain, lightheadedness, or
dizziness.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History revealed coronary artery
disease status post angioplasty in [**3321**] of an LAD lesion,
diagnosed via nuclear scan.  She denies any history of
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or hypercholesterolemia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Aspirin.
2.  Atenolol.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to ERYTHROMYCIN,
PENICILLIN, both resulting in hives; MORPHINE RESULTS IN
NAUSEA/VOMITING.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The maternal grandfather died of a
myocardial infarction at the age of 49.  Father died of a
myocardial infarction at the age of 62.  Mother had a
coronary artery bypass graft times three in her early 60s.
Brother had an angioplasty of his LAD in his early 50s.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a ten pack per year tobacco
history.  She quit in [**3321**].  She drinks alcohol occasionally
and denies any history of intravenous drug abuse.  She is a
former nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital3 **].  She is divorced currently
with one daughter who is 37 weeks pregnant at the moment,
hospitalized at [**Name (NI) **] with preeclampsia.  She is scheduled
for a cesarean section later on this week.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems revealed the following:
The patient is positive for mild diarrhea, poor appetite, and
increased amount of stress secondary to her daughter's
current health.  Otherwise, review of systems is
unremarkable.

Examination on admission:  Temperature 96.3, blood pressure
99/51, pulse 88, respirations 18, 98% oxygen saturation on
two liters nasal cannula.  GENERAL:  The patient is a
pleasant, middle-aged Caucasian female, who is comfortable,
pain free, talkative, but tired in no acute distress.  Pupils
equal, round, and reactive to light.  EOMI.  Sclerae were
anicteric.  Nares patent.  Oropharynx clear without any
exudate or lesions.  Mucous membranes are slightly dry.
NECK:  Revealed no JVD, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly.
Neck was supple and nontender.  LUNGS:  Lungs were clear to
auscultation anteriorly, bilaterally.  CARDIOVASCULAR:
Regular rate and rhythm with no audible rubs, murmurs, or
gallops.  ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with normal
bowel sounds.  There are no palpable masses and no
hepatosplenomegaly.  EXTREMITIES:  Extremities are without
any clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Toes are cool bilaterally
with Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  There is
no evidence of calf tenderness.  The calf site of the right
groin is without any hematoma or oozing of blood.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission revealed the following:
White count 10, hemoglobin 12, hematocrit 36, platelet count
405,000, sodium 140, potassium 4.1, chloride 106, bicarbonate
23, BUN 11, creatinine 0.9, glucose 117.  CK 107, LDH 631,
troponin negative.  Post cardiac catheterization EKG reveals
ST elevations in the inferior leads with ST depressions in 1
and AVL, normal sinus rhythm at 92, normal axis, and normal
intervals.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] was brought up from the
cardiac catheterization laboratory to the Coronary Care Unit
for overnight observation.  She was immediately started on
aspirin, Plavix, Pravachol, Metoprolol 25 t.i.d. and an
Integrilin drip for a total duration of 18 hours.  The
cardiac enzymes were cycled every eight hours.  CK was found
to peak at 1673 at 10 am on [**7-2**].  Similarly, the MB
peaked at 307 at the same time.  Echocardiogram was performed
on [**7-3**] and revealed hypokinetic basilar inferolateral
walls with EF of 45%, 1+ mitral regurgitation, no pericardial
effusion and normal size of all [**Doctor Last Name 1749**].

With the exception of her blood pressure running a little on
the low side and occasional beats of nonsustained V tach on
telemetry, Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] remained stable throughout the night,
status post the catheterization.  It was decided to transfer
her to the Cardiac Stepdown Unit during the morning of
[**7-2**].  As soon as she reached the floor, she had a
large episode of coffee-ground and bright red blood emesis.
As a result, the Integrilin drip was immediately discontinued
and because the blood pressure dropped further, the
Metoprolol was also discontinued.  GI consultation was called
and it was decided to perform an emergent endoscopy only if
further emesis occurred.  The thought was that Ms. [**Known patient lastname 14006**]
use of chronic aspirin had resulted in an underlying
gastritis/ulcer, which had been exacerbated by recent
anticoagulation therapies.  Because she had no further
episodes of emesis, she was managed medically throughout the
hospital stay.  She was kept NPO for 24 hours and serial
hematocrits were checked every six hours.  The lowest the
hematocrit dropped was to 27.9 and as a result, she was
transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.  She was
started on IV Protonix 40 b.i.d. as well as IV fluids at
75  cc an hour.  Electrolytes were checked on a daily basis
and the potassium was kept above 4.  The magnesium was kept
above 2.  Fortunately, she had no further episodes of emesis
and the hematocrit remained stable, hovering around 30 to 31
status post one unit transfusion.  She was advanced to clears
on the night of [**7-3**] and then to a full cardiac diet on
[**7-4**].  The IV Protonix was changed to PO.  The
Metoprolol was restarted at 25 b.i.d.  Because she remained a
little on the hypotensive side with blood pressure running in
the 100s/70s, it was decided not to start an ACE inhibitor at
this point in time.  She was completely asymptomatic with
this blood pressure.  Orthostatics were checked and negative.

Because the random glucose level was elevated on [**7-2**],
a hemoglobin A1c level was checked.  This level is currently
pending.  The creatinine remained stable throughout her stay
at 0.6 and the urine output remained excellent.  She remained
afebrile throughout her stay, but with a leukocytosis most
likely secondary to trauma in the cardiac catheterization
lab/recent myocardial infarction.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Protonix 40 mg PO b.i.d.
2.  Folic acid 1 mg PO b.i.d.
3.  Pravachol 20 mg PO b.i.d.
4.  Plavix 75 mg PO q.d.
5.  Aspirin 325 mg PO q.d.
6.  Metoprolol 25 mg PO b.i.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Acute ST elevation inferior myocardial infarction status
post three stents in the right coronary artery.
2.  Upper GI bleed most likely secondary to gastritis/ulcer.
3.  Anemia.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  The patient is to be transferred on [**7-4**], to [**Hospital3 8246**].  She is to have a bed on the regular medicine floor
with telemetry monitoring.  The reason for this transfer is
that her daughter recently gave birth to twin boys under
emergent cesarean section at [**Hospital3 **] and the patient
wishes to be closer to her daughter at this time.

Attending at [**Hospital1 **] will be Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], a physician who
knows her personally and has followed her on an outpatient
basis.  She is to have a full upper endoscopy study in six to
eight weeks to evaluate gastric/peptic ulcer.  If she is to
have further episodes of gross emesis, emergent endoscopy may
be done.  She is to remain at [**Hospital3 **] until necessary
for post MI observation and titration of her cardiac
medications.
