   Assessment and Plan
   81M with history of coronary artery disease and depressed EF,
   presenting after respiratory failure, found to have EF of 10% with
   3+MR.
   # CORONARIES:  Known 3VD with most recent cath showing in-stent
   restenosis of SVG to OM.  ECG difficult to interpret with RBBB though
   anterior ST changes are suspicious.  Carvedilol stopped this am.
   - Continue with aspirin and plavix
   - Started Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   # PUMP:  Severely depressed EF of 10%.  At this point, currently on
   norepi which is not optimal choice for patient with questionable
   cardiogenic shock.  His severe MR may be worsened with his current
   dilated LV.  At this point, his CXR does not show significant
   congestion (though he is vented) and his saturations are 98% on FiO2 of
   0.4.  Weaned off levo, BPs appropriate.
   - As the patient appears volume overloaded and required reintubation, a
   lasix gtt was restarted at 5 mg/hr
   - Will start beta-blocker as tolerated, then ACEI
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation at transfer.  Unclear if he has been in
   this rhythm in the past.  Currently rate controlled.
   - Beta-blocker, as above
   - Heparin IV
   # PULM:  Respiratory failure likely due to CHF though was treated for
   PNA at OSH.  CXR a large heart with prominent right hilum but no
   obvious infiltrate.  The patient was extubated in the am yesterday,
   however became hypoxic by night and was reintubated.  CXR was
   concerning for developing PNA.  Patient was started on vanc and
   pip-tazo.
   - Continue vanc and pip-tazo for likely PNA
   - Continue on the ventilator for now.
   # Ucler, stage II.  Documented on arrival to CCU.  No signs of
   infection.  Wound consult.
   - f/u wound recs.
   # ANEMIA:  HCT low but stable, this am it decreased to 22, but on
   recheck was 25.8.  Drop noted at the OSH.  Baseline is unclear though
   most likely in the low 30s.  Fe studies consistent w/ combination of Fe
   difficiency and ACD.
   - Will give 1 unit PRBC today and recheck a post transfusion Hct.
   # RENAL FAILURE:  ARF on CKD.  Based on old labs, appears to have CKD
   with baseline SCr in the high 1s.  Currently stable at 2.3.
   -          Will be careful if adding ACEI
   -          Will monitor Cr
   -          Urine lytes
   FEN:  NPO
   ACCESS: Right subclavian
 will pull today.
