   [**3-14**] Events:
   -tachypnea and wheezing with position changes, was initially called out
   to floor but sent back after triggering for above tachypnea to 40
s and
   50
   Per previous MICU admission note:
   76 YO M w/history of parkinson's disease, COPD, afib, hearing loss,
   urinary retention w/indwelling foley, and recent admission for
   aspiration pneumonia admitted today w/complaint of worsening cough and
   low grade temp. Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 17**] [**2-20**] - [**2-24**] and treated w/a
   2 week course of linezolid and zosyn which ended on [**3-5**]. Since then
   patient has had a worsening cough but reports no fever (NH reports temp
   - unclear how high). Patient denies SOB, chest pain, or any other
   symptoms. Patient given Vanco and Zosyn in ED.
   .
   In the emergency department he was found to have low grade temp - 100,
   100.2, tachycardic to 110, tachypnic to 40 and 93% on 3L. He was given
   vanc and zosyn as well as nebs in the ED and admitted to the medical
   floor. On the floor, he was being treated for viral pneumonia.
   Antibiotics were held and he was ordered for q6 nebs. He subsequently
   triggered this evening for tachypnea to the 40s, though has maintained
   his sats in the high 90s on 4L nasal cannula. ABG was 7.43/44/192. He
   was given solumedrol 125mg IV, zosyn, vanco, nebs x 2. Transfer to MICU
   was requested for closer monitoring.
   .
   On arrival to the MICU, the patient denies respiratory distress. Per
   report, he has been having diarrhea recently. His main concern is
   locating his call bell and having the light turned out. He denies LH,
   dizziness, chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain.

   Imaging: [**3-13**] CXR #1: Marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm as
   well as persistent moderate left pleural effusion and associated
   atelectasis remain. There is slightly improved aeration of the left
   upper lobe. The right lung remains clear. The cardiomediastinal
   silhouette is stable. Severe rightward scoliosis limits evaluation.
   Gas-filled loops of colon are again noted.
   IMPRESSION: Slightly improved aeration at the left lung apex with
   decreased pleural effusion. No definite evidence of pneumonia.
   .
   [**3-13**] CXR #2: my read: difficult to interpret [**12-22**] marked elevation of L
   hemidiaphragm, no obvious significant change
   .
   [**3-13**] CT chest:
   1) Persisting dependent consolidation in the left lower lobe, likely
   from aspiration.
   2) Prominent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm without diaphragmatic
   defect.
   3) Two small 4- to 5-mm ground-glass nodules in the right middle lobe
   (3:32) which appear likely unchanged compared to the CT torso of
   [**3079-8-7**], however followup in one year by CT is recommended.
   4) Only partially imaged on today's study is a approximately 4 cm
   apparent cystic mass anterior to the IVC at the level of the filter
   placement. This lesion is not well characterized on this study, though
   is most suggestive of a GI duplication cyst. It has not changed
   significantly from the CT of [**3079-8-23**].
   6) 2 cm indeterminate left renal lesion which is not well characterized
   by non-contrast CT. Evaluation by MR is recommended if the patient is a
   potiental surgical candidate. Otherwise, a 6 month follow-up CT could
   be performed.
   7) Severe scoliosis.
