   Assessment and Plan
   85M presenting with chest pain, found to have left main disease on
   cath, complicated by a Rt ACA CVA and multiple other small infarcts,
   likely embolic.
   # CVA.  Likely embolic secondary to plaque embolus from his aorta
   during the cardiac cath.  Official MRI reports show an acute Rt ACA
   infarct and multiple small infarcts in his right parietal, right medial
   occipital, left parietal, and left frontal regions.  Neuro feels that
   he has completed his stroke.  His left-sided hemiparesis has improved
   significantly, however he still remains weaker on his left side.
   Carotid U/S scheduled for today
   - F/u carotid U/S read.
   - BG < 150, HISS
   - Appreciate neuro recs, will f/u.
   - PT/OT
   - Will start lovenox bridge to coumadin, pt will need coumadin for at
   least 3 months given the embolic nature of his stoke.
   - Will have the patient patient f/u in the outpatient stroke clinic in
   3 months (appt already made).
   # CORONARIES: He initially presented with concern for unstable angina
   and was ruled out by cardiac enzymes; ECG difficult to interpret in
   setting of LBBB.  Cardiac cath showed LMCA disease.   CABG was
   considered however given his recent stroke and the risk of open-heart
   surgery both the surgeons and the family feel it would be better to
   proceed with medical management at this time.
   - Continue ASA 81mg
   - Increase Metoprolol to 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] and up-tightrate as tolerated by
   BPs.
   - Continue high dose statin
   - Restart ACEI as tolerated by BPs, likely tomorrow.
   - Once he recovers from the acute event, can consider continue medical
   management vs CABG for his left main stem partial blockage.
   # PUMP: Echo with low-normal EF 50-55% and LVH.  Patient with lower
   extremity edema on exam, but JVP is 7.  Likely [**1-22**] venous
   insufficiency.
   - Will have the patient wear compression stockings to decrease his
   lower extremity edema.
   - Gentle diuresis, 20mg IV lasix, for now and f/u lytes.
   # RHYTHM: Sinus bradycardia on telemetry, however the patient has a
   reported history of PAF (patient denies).
   - Continue telemetry.
   - Patient with need 2 week long monitor as an outpatient to monitor for
   a.fib (per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2767**] as this would change the length of treatment
   with coumadin.  If the patient is found to have a.fib, will need
   lifelong coumadin therapy.
   # ANEMIA: Hct stable today at 35.4
   - Follow daily Hct
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA: 130s-140s. Low before heparin.  Continue to
   monitor.
   # SPINAL STENOSIS:
   - Pain control with acetaminophen
   # HYPERTENSION:  Patient currently having low SBP
   - Holding  ACE, CCB,
   - continue decreased dose of Metoprolol as above.
   # LUNG NODULE: Seen on CXR as incidental finding, no priors for
   comparison.
   - Will need CT for further eval but will hold off for now, will need
   f/u as OP.
   # RIGHT BUTTOCK PRIOR DECUB ULCER SITE: Patient reports this is site of
   prior decub which occured during hip fracture surgery.  Per his report,
   was difficult to heal.
   - Skin care; if worsens, wound consult
   ICU Care
   Nutrition:  Cardiac healthy reg. diet.
