History of Present Illness:
81 year old man with HTN, PUD, DM and CRI presented on [**2671-7-10**] to
[**Hospital3 **] with progressive shortness of breath, epigastric
fullness, chest pain and dysuria. His EKG showed Q waves V1-4
and STD laterally and initial Troponin-I was 0.85, which
subsequently bumped to 70.93 on next draw and then trended down
to 55.28 prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 22**]. His CXR and exam were also
found to be consistent with pulmonary edema (pt O2 sat 95% 3L)
and pt was diuresed with 40 mg IV Lasix. He was noted to have a
UTI (+ E.Coli with unknown antimicrobial sensitivities) and
treated with a dose of 500 mg IV Levoquin (remained afebrile).
Also, his Cr on admission 2.5 (recent baseline apparently 1.6)
with a K 6.9. These were treated with Kayexalate, insulin,
calcium gluoncate and Lasix. The pt's home ACEi was held and his
repeat SCr this morning was 2.1.
.
Pt was reportedly loaded with 600 mg clopidogrel and started on
heparing and nitroglycerin gtts. Arrangments were made for
transfer to [**Hospital1 22**] for cardiac catheterization.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 22**], the patient was comfortable with stable
vitals, but was noted to have persistent wet crackles on lung
exam with a 4L NC oxygen requirement. Repeat CE were CK: 459
MB:19 MBI:4.1 Trop-T:5.27. As the nitro infusion rate was very
low, this was stopped and he was continued on heparin.
Integrelin was not started due to renal failure.
.
After several hours on the floor, the patient reported
experiencing recurrent [**3-14**] right chest pain (achy, pressure
sensation) while eating. This pain was identical to this
discomfort that caused him to present initially. An ECG was
remarkable for new 2 mm STE in V1 and 1 mm STE in V2, as well as
new inferior Q waves. A nitroglycerin gtt was restarted with
rapid resolution in the patient's symptoms. Repeat ECG once pain
free was remarkable for a new RBBB. Given the patient's
recurrent CP and dynamic ECG changes he was transferred to the
CCU for ongoing monitoring.

[**7-12**] Cardiac Cath
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominanat system

revealed severe LM and 3 vessel coronary artery disease. The
LMCA had
diffues 90% stenosis involving the proximal LAD. Poor distal
filling of
the LAD was noted with R to L collaterals. The LCX was noted to
have
poor filling with one reasonable sized OM with a diffuse 80%
proximal
stenosis. The RCA was a large vessel with a proximal PDA 70%
stenosis in
a notably small vessel. The RPL had a 60% stenosis.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic blood pressure.
There
was elevated right sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 16
mmHg. There
were elevated estimated left sided filling pressures with mean
PCWP of
18 mmHg. There was mild pulmonary hypertension with PASP of 30
mmHg.
3. Successful IABP placement.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Left main and Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful IABP placement.

[**7-13**] Cardiac Cath
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed 3 vessel coronary
artery
disease. The LMCA had a 90% stenosis. The proximal LAD had a 90%

stenosis and was diffusely diseased distally. The LCX was
diffusely
disease and the OM2 had an 80% mid vessel stenosis. The RCA was
not
engaged.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
pressures with
good diastolic augmentation from the IABP.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the LMCA with a 3.0 x 28 mm
XIENCE
DES which was post dilated with a 4.0 x 12 mm NC balloon at 14
ATM.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the stent, no

dissection and TIMI III flow. (See PTCA comments)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful stenting of the LMCA.

[**7-12**] TTE
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30
%) with globbal hypokinesis and regioanl akinesis of the
inferior wall, distal septum and apex (multivessel CAD?). RV
with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Carotid U/S
IMPRESSION: Mild plaque in the internal carotid arteries
bilaterally with
less than 40% stenosis on both sides. This is a baseline
examination at the
[**Hospital1 22**].

[**2671-7-11**]:
Repeat CE trending down: CK:327 MB:14 MBI:4.3 Trop-T:4.15

81 yo male with history of HTN and diabetes who presented to OSH
with SOB/CP found to have NSTEMI, transferred to [**Hospital1 22**] for
cardiac cath and to CCU for ongoing monitoring in setting of
recurrent CP and new RBBB.
.
#. CAD: Patient was found to have an NSTEMI at an OSH.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 22**] for cardiac cath and further monitoring.
His EKG showed Q waves V1-4 and STD laterally and initial
Troponin-I was 0.85, which subsequently bumped to 70.93 on next
draw and then trended down to 55.28 prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 22**].
.
Pt was reportedly loaded with 600 mg clopidogrel and started on
heparin and nitroglycerin gtts. On arrival to [**Hospital1 22**], the patient
was comfortable with stable vitals, but was noted to have
persistent wet crackles on lung exam with a 4L NC oxygen
requirement. Repeat CE were CK: 459 MB:19 MBI:4.1 Trop-T:5.27.
As the nitro infusion rate was very low, this was stopped and he
was continued on heparin. Integrelin was not started due to
renal failure.
.
After several hours on the floor, the patient reported
experiencing recurrent [**3-14**] right chest pain (achy, pressure
sensation) while eating. This pain was identical to this
discomfort that caused him to present initially. An ECG was
remarkable for new 2 mm STE in V1 and 1 mm STE in V2, as well as
new inferior Q waves. A nitroglycerin gtt was restarted with
rapid resolution in the patient's symptoms. Repeat ECG once pain
free was remarkable for a new RBBB. Given the patient's
recurrent CP and dynamic ECG changes he was transferred to the
CCU for ongoing monitoring.
Pt with multiple risk factors for CAD, including HTN and
diabetes.  The patient underwent cardiac cath on that showed
severe LM and 3 vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had
diffues 90% stenosis involving the proximal LAD, OM with a
diffuse 80% proximal stenosis. The RCA was a large vessel with a
proximal PDA 70% stenosis and RPL with 60% stenosis.
Additionally, an IABP was successfully placed.  Given the
patient's disease a discussion occured regarding CABG, but the
patient declined surgery and opted for stenting.  The patient
then underwent successful stenting of his LMCA with a 3.0 x 28
mm DES on [**2671-7-13**].  The patient tolerated the procedure well and
his IABP was weaned and successfully removed on [**7-14**].  The
patient remained chest pain free.  He was continued on aspirin,
plavix, metoprolol, and atorvastatin.  His ACE-I was held
secondary to his renal failure.

#. Pump: At the OSH the patient's CXR and exam were consistent
with pulmonary edema (pt O2 sat 95% 3L) and pt was diuresed with
40 mg IV Lasix. Pt initially with evidence of mild failure on
exam by report, although in the CCU the patient appeared
improved.  The patient was on Lasix as an outpatient. An ECHO
performed on [**7-12**] showed EF 25-30% with global hypokinesis and
regioanl akinesis of the inferior wall, distal septum and apex.
Likely suspect ischemia as major contributing etiology to his
failure.  The patient was given lasix 20mg IV for diuresis and
restarted on his home dose of 40mg po.

#. Rhythm: NSR per OSH EKGs, with RBBB initally on ECG.  On
repeat [**7-13**] the bundle branch had resolved.

#. [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: By report pt had some urinary retention at OSH
and improved s/p Foley catheter placement. Also, his Cr on
admission 2.5 (recent baseline apparently 1.6) with a K 6.9.
These were treated with Kayexalate, insulin, calcium gluoncate
and Lasix at the OSH. The pt's home ACEi was held and his repeat
SCr this morning was 2.1. The patient's creatine did trend up to
2.3 after his two cardiac catheterizations.  Prior to each
procedure he was given mucomyst and pre-cath hydration.  His
ACE-I was held secondary to his rising creatinine. On discharge
hos creatine was improving and was 2.0 on discharge.
.
#. Urinary Tract Infection: At the OSH he was noted to have a
UTI (+ E.Coli that was pansensitive). He was treated at the OSH
with a dose of 500 mg IV Levoquin.  He reamined afebrile.  On
admission he was treated with Ciprofloxacin 500 mg Q24H x 6 days
(total 7 day course). His repeat urine culture here was no
growth.
.
#. Urinary Retention: The patient was found to have retention at
the OSH and foley catheter was placed.  During his admission his
foley was removed, but the patient was unable to void. A foley
was placed again and speaking with Urology recommended leaving
the foley in place for 1 week with urology follow-up as an
outpatient.  He was arranged with outpatient follow-up on [**7-20**].
He was also restarted on doxazosin.

#. GERD: Was on PPI at home and at OSH. Due to interaction with
clopidogrel he was changed to H2 blocker (Ranitidine 150 mg
[**Hospital1 **]).
.
#. Diabetes: His home medications of metformin, glimepiride,
rosiglitazone were held. He was continued on ISS and diabetic
diet.  He was discharged on his home regimen.
.
# Anemia: The patient was found to be iron deficient and low
B12.  He was started on iron supplements and given an IM dose of
Vit B12.  His Hct remained stable and discharge Hct was 28.4.
He did not receive blood products durng his admission.
