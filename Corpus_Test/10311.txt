HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old gentleman
with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral
vascular disease, hypercholesterolemia, admitted to [**Hospital6 1900**] for cardiac catheterization
on [**2845-10-31**].  The patient had a two-month history of
dizziness and light-headedness.  Electrocardiogram at his
primary care physician's office showed a [**Street Address(2) 1747**] depression
in leads V4 and V5.  The patient had a Persantine Thallium
test which revealed moderate to severe reversible apical
perfusion defect.  During this test, the patient developed ST
depressions in leads V3-V6, as well as chest pressure and arm
discomfort.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Coronary artery disease.  2.  Type
2 diabetes mellitus.  3.  Chronic renal insufficiency.  4.
Peripheral vascular disease.  5.  Status post left femoral to
pedal bypass.  6.  History of nephrolithiasis.  7.  Status
post bladder surgery.  8.  Status post transmetatarsal
amputation of the left third through fifth toes.  9.
Hypercholesterolemia.

ALLERGIES:  PERCOCET.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.,
Metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. q.d., Avandia 8 mg p.o. q.d.,
Glucotrol XL 10 mg p.o. q.d., Captopril 12.5 mg, Colace 100
mg p.o. b.i.d., Glucophage.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 6.6, hematocrit
27.6, platelet count 195; potassium 4.2, BUN 30, creatinine
1.3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Cardiac
Catheterization Lab on [**2845-10-31**].  The patient was
found to have borderline left ventricular ejection fraction,
80% mid left anterior descending, 80% proximal left
circumflex, 90% ostial RPDA.  The patient was referred to Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 4689**] for bypass surgery.

The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2845-11-2**], by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4689**] for coronary artery bypass grafting
times four, LIMA to proximal to left anterior descending,
saphenous vein graft to distal left anterior descending,
saphenous vein graft to OM1, saphenous vein graft to OM2.

Please see operative note for further details.  The patient
was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in stable
condition.

The patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical
ventilation on his first postoperative night.  The patient
required Neo-Synephrine to maintain adequate blood pressure,
as well as an Insulin drip.  The patient required
Neo-Synephrine infusion to maintain his blood pressure
through postoperative day #2.  He was weaned to off.  The
patient also had periods of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
and was begun on Amiodarone oral load.

The patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day
#2.  The patient was noted to have elevated blood glucose
levels and was ordered for his oral agents and Insulin
sliding scale; however, the patient on postoperative day #3,
received his full sliding scale coverage.  The patient
continued to have blood glucose levels.  The patient was
preoperatively followed by the [**Hospital 124**] Clinic.  Per the
physician orders, the patient was to be restarted on his full
oral agents and regular Insulin sliding scale.  The patient
eventually agreed.

The patient began working with Physical Therapy to increase
ambulation and tolerated this well.  On postoperative day #5,
the patient was cleared for discharge to a rehabilitation
facility.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Vital signs:  T-max 97.7??????, pulse 77,
sinus rhythm, blood pressure 133/76, respirations 18, room
air oxygen saturation 93%, blood sugars ranged from 117-358
(358 was while the patient was still refusing his full
Insulin coverage).  Neurological:  The patient is
neurologically intact in no apparent distress.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate and rhythm.  Respiratory:
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Breath sounds
decreased at bilateral bases.  Abdomen:  Soft and nontender.
Extremities:  Warm and well perfused.  Incisions were clean,
dry and intact.  Sternum was stable.

DISCHARGE LABORATORY DATA:  CBC revealed a white blood cell
count of 10.7, hematocrit 26.9, platelet count 208; CHEM7
showed a sodium of 139, potassium 4.4, chloride 101, bicarb
39, BUN 28, creatinine 1.2, glucose 179, magnesium 2.0,
phosphate 2.8, ionized calcium 1.13.

Chest x-ray from [**2845-11-5**], showed small bilateral
pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.

The patient had undergone carotid ultrasound prior to going
to the Operating Room which showed minimal plaques involving
both internal carotid arteries without associated stenosis.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post coronary artery bypass grafting.
2.  Postoperative atrial fibrillation.
3.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
4.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
5.  Peripheral vascular disease.
6.  Status post left femoral pedal bypass.
7.  History of nephrolithiasis.
8.  Status post bladder surgery.
9.  Status post transmetatarsal amputation of the left third
through fifth toes.
10. Hypercholesterolemia.
