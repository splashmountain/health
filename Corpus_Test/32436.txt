Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1735**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, Bilateral arm pain and palpitations


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Peripheral arterial Catheterization
Left brachial artery exploration and thrombus removal
Left Lung thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 75 year old female who presented to an outside
hospital on [**2903-11-3**] with complaints of feeling her heart
racing and pain running down both arms for about 1-2 hours prior
to admission. She had associated nausea and vomiting at that
time, and mild shortness of breath. She denied any chest pain,
fevers, chills, back pain, abdominal pain, or diaphoresis. Her
son had called 911 and en route to the hospital, she was given
sublingual nitroglycerine x1 with good effect. Upon arrival to
the emergency room she was found to be in atrial fibbrilation
with rapid ventricular response to 153bpm. EKG was reported to
have no ST segment elevations, but was notable for ST segment
changes consistant with digitalis in the inferior leads.
Patient's chest X-ray showed increased vascular markings
consistant with congestive heart failure. She was given 325mg of
ASA and dosed with Cardizem drip. Total CK was normal at 25,
Troponin I of 0.1, BNP of 647. She was started on a heparin drip
and admitted.

During her admission, she developed some ST elevation which was
thought to be related to demand ischemia. Her heart rate was
well controlled on the Cardizem drip and she was loaded with
digoxin. On [**11-5**] she developed a white count of 22.5k and
worsening renal function (Creat 0.8->2.1), and steadly
increasing tropoins (0.1 -> 1.75 -> 2.37 -> 2.53). Urinalysis
showed brown granular casts with + blood, 10-25 WBCs and 2+
bacteria for which she was given one dose of Levoquin 500mg on
day of transfer. Echocardiogram showed an EF of 20% with all
segments being akinetic except the base and inferior-lateral
wall. She had a normal ECHO on [**2901-3-25**].  On day prior to
admission at [**Hospital1 22**], patient was developing worsening renal
failure, increasing O2 requirement, and impression was for
cardiogenic shock.  She was started on dopamine and transfered
to [**Hospital1 22**] for further management of her condition on [**2903-11-5**].
.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock
or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2903-11-5**]:
1. Severely depressed left ventricular systolic function
consistent with Takotsubo type of cardiomyopathy with severe
hypokinesis/akinesis of the mid to apical left ventricle.
Elevated filling pressures.
2. Apical thrombus maybe present.
3. Apical to mid severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the RV.
4. Small to moderate anterior echodense pericardial effusion.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the
presence of elevated right sided pressures.
5. Mild to moderate MR.
6. Moderate TR.
7. Moderate elevations of estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure.

ECHO [**2903-11-7**]:
The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate
to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
near akinesis of the distal half of the inferior wall, septum
and anterior wall. The apex is mildly aneurysmal and akinetic.
The basal segments contract best (LVEF = 25 %). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. There is focal akinesis of the apical
half of the free wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2903-11-5**],
the severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are now
reduced. Biventricular systolic function is similar. These
findings are most c/w coronary artery disease (mid-LAD
infarction).
The previously noted pericardial effusion is likely epicardial
fat. No intraventricular thrombus is seen on review of the prior
study.

ECHO [**2903-11-20**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely
more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral
valve chordae. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate to severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an echo dense
mass adherent to the apical visceral pericardium that may
represent hematoma (was not apparent in the prior study). There
is a small pericardial effusion. The pericardium may be
thickened. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the
presence of elevated right sided pressures.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2903-11-7**],
left ventricular systolic function appears markedly improved
(consistent with possible stress induced (Takotsubo)
cardiomyopathy). Tricuspid regurgitation is now more prominent.
Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now much higher
(raising concern for a possible intercurrent process such as
pulmonary embolus).

CTA [**2903-11-25**]:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.  Large bilateral pleural effusions with associated bibasilar
atelectasis.
3.  [**Hospital1 8**]-apical scarring.
4.  5-mm right lung nodule which may be inflammatory or
infectious. Attention
should be paid to this area on follow-up exams.

LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS DOPPLER: BILATERAL- NO DVT

PLEURAL FLUID (LEFT LUNG)- TRANSUDATIVE.  CYTOLOGY PENDING UPON
DISCHARGE, PLEASE FOLLOW UP IN [**12-26**] WEEKS POST DISCHARGE.

CT HEAD [**11-23**]: No evidence of hemorrhage or major vascular
territorial
infarction.

CT C-SPINE [**11-20**]: Limited study due to patient motion.  No large
fracture is identified.  No definite dislocation is present.
Multilevel degenerative changes particularly at the C4/C5, C5/C6
and C6/C7 levels.  Mild anterolisthesis of C4 over C5.  If there
is high clinical suspicion for cervical spine fracture consider
a repeat cervical spine CT scan.

HIP X RAY: No acute fractures or dislocations.

EKG: [**2903-11-8**] Atrial fibrillation with mean ventricular rate
111. Low QRS voltage in the limb leads. Diffuse non-diagnostic
repolarization abnormalities. Compared to previous tracing of
[**2903-11-7**] multiple abnormalities persist without major change.

[**2903-11-26**]: Atrial fibrillation, mean ventricular rate 95. Low QRS
voltage in the limb leads. Diffuse non-diagnostic repolarization
abnormalities. Compared to previous tracing of [**2903-11-23**] multiple
abnormalities persist without major change.

[**11-14**] Peripheral Arterial Cath:
1. Successful PTCA of the 100% occluded left CFA, SFA and
profunda femoral artery vir 4 french left brachial approach with
a
4.0x40mm baloon with restoration of good flow in the left cfa,
profunda
and sfa with slow flow to the shin. [**Name (NI) 844**] PT pulse at the
end of
the case.
2. Left brachial artery thrombosis despite act 250 at sheath
pull with
loss of left radial pulse; patient going to OR now for left
brachail
exploration and thrombus removal.

[**11-14**] Cardiac Cath:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

revealed no angiographically apparent significant coronary
artery
disease.  The LMCA had no angiographically apparent significant
stenoses.  The LAD had a proximal 30% lesion.  The LCX and RCA
were
without angiographically apparent flow-limiting stenoses.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mild systemic arterial

hypotension of 85/43 mm Hg.  Left sided filling pressures were
mildly
elevated with LVEDp of 20 mm Hg.  There was no transvalvular
gradient
upon pullback of the catheter from LV to aorta.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Arterial access was difficult to obtain on bilateral femoral
arteries, even after multiple attempts under ultrasound and
doppler
guidance.  Arterial flow was obtained in the left femoral artery
on
multiple occassions with good arterial flow, but a wire could
not
successfully be passed into the iliac arteries.  Access was
finally
obtained on the left via the femoral artery.
5. Distal aortagram revealed diffuse atherosclerotic disease of
bilateral aortoiliac systems, with complete occlusion of the
right iliac
artery.  Distal vessels filled via collaterals.

[**2903-11-11**] Renal Ultrasound:
1.  No evidence of renal calculi or hydronephrosis bilaterally.
2.  Hyperechoic interpolar lateral right renal lesion with
vascular flow
within it.  Ultrasound characteristics may be suggestive of a
benign
angiomyolipoma, however, a neoplasm cannot be excluded given
internal
vascularity. Further evaluation with dedicated MR examination is
recommended if patient can tolerate.  Otherwise, non-contrast
and contrast-enhanced CT examination can be considered.
3.  Moderate left pleural effusion.

[**2903-12-8**] Chest CT
1. Collapse of the left lung with a very large pleural effusion.
Large right pleural effusion with partial collapse of the right
lower lobe. Collapsed left main stem bronchus with tracheal and
bronchial secretions.

2. 1 cm right lower lobe pulmonary artery aneurysm seen on the
[**2903-11-25**] study is not well evaluated on this study.

3. Multiple low-density lesions in the spleen, likely cysts from
remote trauma or infarct.


Brief Hospital Course:
OVERALL SUMMARY OF COURSE OF ILLNESS
78 year old woman with history of CAD, afib, smoking,
alcoholism, GERD w/esophageal strictures, osteoporosis s/p hip
fracture ([**2890**]), poor nutritional intake, presents as transfer
from CCU after prolonged hospitalization at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1864**]
Hospital and [**Hospital1 **] for chest pain that included
cardiac catherization (complicated by brachial artery
thrombosis), heart failure, remeron-induced delirium, iatrogenic
renal failure, and finding of an incidental mass of kidney.
.
The patient was in the midst of a 1-month long program
supervised by her primary care doctor to improve her nutritional
intake when, one morning in early [**Month (only) 528**] she developed nausea
and pain up and down her arms.  Her son called an ambulance and
the patient received nitroglycerin in transit with some relief
of her symptoms.  Upon admission to the OSH, patient was in Afib
with RVR and reported ST changes concerning for digitalis
toxicity. She was started on aspirin, diltiazem drip, and
heparin drip. She developed ST elevations thought secondary to
demand ischemia. Her HR improved with diltiazem drip and she was
loaded with digoxin.  She was felt to be in heart failure with
and was aggressively diuresed with furosemide.
.
Shortly after admission to OSH, her WBC increased to 22,
creatinine increased from .8 to 2.1, and troponins increased
from .1 to 2.53. The patient was admitted to the ICU for her
renal failure.  UA demonstrated 10-25 WBCs with 2+ bacteria and
she was started on levofloxacin. Additionally, an echo
demonstrated EF 20%, akinesis except base and inferior-lateral
wall. She also became hypotensive and was started on dopamine.
During the course of her stay, she pulled out her nasogastric
tube and IVs, possibly representing alcohol withdrawal.
.
Per the patient's son's request, she was trasnferred via med
flight to the [**Hospital1 22**] on [**11-5**] for further management.  She was
transferred to the CCU team for further management of her CHF
and likely cardiogenic shock. Her initial echo demonstrated a
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Subsequent echos have demonstrated
improvement in EF. She also underwent catheterization which
demonstrated clean coronaries. She was transitioned from
dopamine to dobutamine with the addition of a lasix gtt. She had
a moderate diuresis with improvement in both her blood pressures
and her creatinine. She has had occasional episodes of
hypotension with low urine output for unclear reasons.
Differential includes persistent CHF and poor PO intake.
Regarding her atrial fibrillation, she was started initially on
diltiazem gtt and was transitioned to oral metoprolol. Her vital
signs have remained stable.

As a complication of the catheterization, she developed a
femoral thombus.  She underwent emergent thrombectomy and as a
complication developed brachial thrombus as well.  She underwent
a thrombectomy for the brachial thrombus.  Following surgical
thrombectomy, the patient complained of pain her abdomen and was
found to incidentally have a growth on her kidney on renal
ultrasound.
.
While the abdominal pain resolved, the patient was felt to have
a depressed appetite and was started on a trial of the
antibiotic Remeron.  The single dose of remeron pushed the
patient into a "demented state" and the patient has gradually
improved back to baseline after withdrawal of the remeron. The
patient's hospitalization was further complicated by a fall for
which she had head imaging that was not concerning for an acute
bleed.
.
Over the past week, the patient and family underwent
consultation with palliative care physicians because of her
overall failure to thrive and the patient was awaiting placement
to a rehabiliation facility when she develoepd an elevated white
count (13).  A chest x-ray showed a question of a consolidation
and she was started on treatment for a presumed hospital
acquired pneumonia.  The patient was transferred from the CCU
team to the medicine service for continuing management.
OTHER ISSUES DURING ADMISSION
-Apical Thrombus Her echo on admission demonstrated a possible
apical thrombus and she was maintained on anticoagulation for
this (in addition to her atrial fibrillation)
- E.coli UTI and possible pyelo - she was started levofloxacin
on [**2903-11-5**] for an E.coli UTI and then transitioned to cipro.
The patient developed abdominal pain and an elevated WBC on
[**2903-11-1**] raising the concern for pyelonephritis; however her pain
and leukocytosis improved. She received 10 day course of
levo/cipro ([**2818-11-4**])
- Nutrition assessment - Patient has been followed closely with
nutrition and geriatrics regarding her decreased PO intake.
Initial nutrition assessment on [**11-8**] recommended NGT with tube
feeds, supplements, and a bedside speech and swallow on [**11-8**]
demonstrated no aspiration but concerns of stricture causing her
poor intake.  She received a short course of TPN ([**Date range (1) 7120**])
for poor PO intake but after she pulled her NGT. This was
discontinued and patient has been on a PO diet.
- Acute renal failure - Patient was admitted with elevated
creatinine. Her creatinine improved steadily with diuresis,
making pre-renal renal failure secondary to poor forward flow
most likely.
- EtOH - Patient's malnutrition and many of her medical problems
are thought most likely secondary to her alcoholism. She is
pre-contemplative about abstaining from alcohol and states
repeatedly that she wants beer or to go to the bar.
- s/p fall and hypotension - On [**2903-11-20**], she triggered after
she fell and also for hypotension with SBP in the 80s. An echo
that day demonstrated elevated PA pressure concerning for PE.
Differential for her fall and hypotension were concerning for
PE, decreased PO, and infection. CTA chest was negative for PE.

- thoracentesis on [**2903-11-27**] - Patient has been noted to have
persistent bilateral pleural effusions and she underwent a
thoracentesis on [**2903-11-27**] without complication.
- altered mental status - On the day of transfer to medicine
([**2903-12-4**]), patient developed hypoxia requiring 2L nasal canula
and leukocytosis to 15, raising concern for hospital-acquired
pneumonia. She was started on vanco/zosyn for treatment of
presumed hospital acquired pneumonia.
==============================
SYSTEM SPECIFIC REVIEW
==============================
CARDIAC: She was seen and evaluated by the CCU team upon
arrival. She was on Dopamine drip on arrival with systolic
pressures in the mid 90s and heart rate in the 70s. She was
saturating 95% on 100% O2 NRB. A swan-ganz catheter was placed
and showed a wedge of 32 and a PA systolic in the low 50s.
Cardiac index was below 2.0 initially. She was switched to
Dobutamine and initial index was 2.04 and a SVR of 1300. Index
rose to 2.9 and a SVR in the 800s on 4mcg of dobutamine.
Echocardiography showed a decresed ejection fraction (30%) with
distal akinesis of LV and RV. Also noted a mural thrombus. She
was previously on anticoagulation via heparin drip for her
atrial fibbrilation and that was continued.  Patient was
transferred to the floor for management with plan for cardiac
cath.  Cath was deferred initially due to increasing WBC count
and flank pain concerning for possible pyelonephritis.  Ua c/w
persistent UTI although not overly suggestive of pyelonephritis.
 Renal USD was obtained that showed no evidence of perinephric
abscess, stones or hydronephrosis.  Patient remained afebrile,
and cardiac cath was performed on [**11-14**] demonstrating peripheral
arterial disease without significant coronary disesase, she
developed a brachial artery thrombus post procedure and required
surgical exploration and successful removal of thrombus from the
brachial artery.  Her initial two echocardiograms revealed a
depressed LVEF and a Takatsubo pattern to her contractility,
this resolved, also consitent with this entity.  Unclear as to
whether this was associated to her ETOH use.  She developed
pleural effusions which were large (especially on the left)
during her stay and responded slowly to diuresis, she had a left
thoracentesis and subsequently was sating 100% on room air,
though this rapidly reaccumulated secondary to her low albumen
and poor nutritional status.  She underwent a second
thoracentesis with again good improvement in her respiratory
status. In consultation with the pulmonary team, her pleural
effusions were thought to be worsened by recurrent mucous
plugging causing left lung collapse. Treatment with mucomyst,
albuterol, and chest PT greatly improved her lung aeration.  CXR
prior to discharge showed persistent bilateral effusions.  Her
chronic atrial fibrillation was rate controlled with metoprolol
throughout her course.  She had one episode of afib with RVR 2d
prior to discharge which was quickly rate controlled with the
administration of 10mg of IV diltiazem.  She was started on PO
diltiazem with improved rate control and maintained this for the
next 48hrs.  It was thought that this episode may have been
secondary to either albuterol nebulizer treatments or the
recently started ritalin dosing.  Given her lack of response in
terms of appetite (although she was more alert and awake), it
would be advisable to stop this medication should she experience
another episode of rapid ventricular respose to her atrial
fibrillation.
.
GU/Renal:  Patient initially with UTI (E-coli which was
pan-sensitive), treated with Levofloxacin, treatment complete,
follow up urine cultures neagtive.  Creatinine increased to 2.3
upon admission, likely ATN, cardiogenic shock possibly post cath
and contrast nephropathy in the setting of heart failure, with
improvement of heart failure her renal function improved.
Responded well to diuretics.   Renal USD demonstrated a probable
angiomyolipoma and radiology recommneded rec'd CT abdomen or MRI
for further evaluation, she should have this as a follow up as
an outpatient in the future.  Her Cr was normal on d/c.
.
GI: Patient with poor PO intake (200 cal/day), and dysphagia,
she states she doesn't eat because she has a poor appetite, not
because of the dysphagia or because of dyspepsia or any other
reason.  During hospitalization it was learned patient has
history of esophageal dilation in past (x2).  Plan for
outpatient evaluation.  As far as her diet, she was repeatedely
encouraged to eat and with some encouragement she does make
small steps and take in some PO and some ensure, her family
members were helpful in this regard.  At home she takes in most
of her calories from beer but here without beer she is not
taking in much PO at all.  She wishes to go home and continue
drinking despite encouragement of ETOH cessation from multiple
physicians.  No signs of ETOH withdrawal during admission.  Both
she and her family refused any more definitive treatment such as
PEG or NGT for increased nutritional repletion. She was given
TPN for approximately one week, however, began to exhibit signs
of volume overload, therefore this was discontinued.
Additionally, a family meeting was held on [**11-30**] attended by
family, CCU team and palliative care. At that time, a decision
was made to attempt a trial of PO for 10 days to determine if
patient can replete her own nutrition.  Patient also had a trial
of methylphenidate with minimal improvement in oral intake (but
increased wakefulness and interaction with family and staff).
Although her PO intake continues to be poor, her family believes
that her PO intake might improve if she had additional physical
therapy. She was evaluated by PT and OT who thought she was an
adequate rehab candidate. She is recommended to go to rehab and
follow her PO intake there. If her PO intake continues to be
poor, she and her family will again need to consider the role
for hospice.
.
Mental status: the patient had a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 437**] mental status
for the majority of her stay, she would become delerious
(disoriented and somnolent) without any clear cause, toxic /
metabolic causes were ruled out and appropriate head imaging was
performed with no yield.  One episode may have been attributed
to remeron use and this should be avoided in the future.  The
patient was back to her baseline AOx3 with mild dementia upon
discharge.  If she is able to abstain from alcohol for several
months at home, the geriatrics service reccommended
cognitive/memory evaluation as an outpatient at a later date.
.
Infectious disease: Prior to transfer to the medicine service,
the patient developed an increasing productive cough with a
leukocytosis. Given her [**Hospital 23895**] hospital stay, her CXR
appearing and her clinical status, she will be treated for
hospital acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn for a 7
day course.  She completed this course on [**12-10**] and was afebrile
for several days prior to discharge.
