   Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 11508**] is an 80 year old lady followed closely in our [**Hospital **] clinic for
   pulmonary aspergillus infection and Mycobacterium abscessus and a
   recent H. Flu PNA. Upon presentation to [**Hospital **] clinic, she was noted to
   have persistent productive cough with sputum production and decreased
   energy. Exam in [**Hospital **] clinic was notable for BP 80/45. She was then
   referred to the ED for further evaluation.
   .
   In the ED, initial VS: T 98.3, HR 82, BP 92/42, RR 19, and pulse ox 92%
   on RA. Exam was notable for RLQ Crackles, nontender abdomen. Labs,
   Imaging concerning for cholecystitis, and surgery was consulted
   recommending only a HIDA scan for possible percutaneous cholecystostomy
   tube. Broad spectrum coverage for HAP with Linezolid/Clinda/Zosyn was
   initiated, constrained by allergies.  ASA, 2L NS Transfer VS: VS: 99.4
   88 105/39 18 99% 2L

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN:
   An 80 year old lady with multiple pulmonary insults, Fungal PNA
   admitted to the ICU with borderline hypotension in the setting of ?
   cholecystitis.
   .
   #. Hypotension: The patient's BP, once receiving 2L NS in the ED has
   remained in the 90s-100s, close to her apparent baseline.  She is on
   Lisinopril, Atenolol and multiple narcotics at her nursing home and
   presumable received them today.  Possible causes include Iatrogenic BP
   Meds, Hypovolemia from hypotension, Sepsis from Pulmonary or GI source
   (unlikely given CXR, normal WBC count, benign abdominal exam).  The
   patient also has poor peripheral access.
   - Monitor UOP goal 30mL/hr
   - Goal SBP >= 90
   - Fluid bolus PRN given likely hypotension
   - Continue Linezolid, Zosyn, Voriconazle for Pulm/GI source
   - Minimize Narcotics, hold Lisinopril/Atenolol, Lasix
   .
   #. Nausea/?CCY: The patient has a stone and possible distended bladder
   neck on U/S & CT.  She has no abdominal tenderness and no [**Doctor Last Name 2010**]
   sign, but has been vomiting x3 days.  Differential includes biliary
   colic, gastroenteritis with incidental finding and early
   cholecystisits.  Elevated Alk Phos non-specific, may be from fungal
   infection, anti-fungals or from CCY.
   - HIDA Scan in AM
   - Surgery Recs
   - Zofran prn
   - NPO
   .
   #. Multiple Pulmonary Infections: The patient has an ongoing treatment
   with ID for Pulmonary Aspergillosis & M. abscessus with a recent H. Flu
   PNA.  She has a continued cough, worse the last three days.
   - Appreciate ID Input
   - Continue Voriconazole
   - Nebs
   - Cough suppresion with Guaifenisin &  Benzonatate
   .
   #. Acute Kidney Injury: Cr 2.0, baseline 0.9, likely pre-renal from
   poor PO intake, but ATN possible.  No obstruction noted.
   - Urine Lytes, Eos
   - Fluid hydration as above
   - Hold Lasix, Lisinopril
   .
   #. COPD: Not likely an exacerbation, treat underlying infections as
   above.
   - Tiotropium
   - Nebs
   - No indication for steroids at this time
   .
   #. Anti-Epileptic Use:  Cannot find history of epilepsy, seizures or
   brain mets currently.
   - Continue current doses of Keppra & Dilantin, check levels in AM
   .
   #. Prednisone Use: unsure why patient is on prednisone
   - Random Cortisol in AM
   .
   #. Chronic Pain: Unclear why, but the patient is on Fentanyl, Lidoderm,
   Oxycodone, Tramadol, Ibuprofen and Tylenol.
   - Obtain outside records
   - Continue Fentanyl, Lidoderm, Tylenol only
