   Imaging: CXR - Right costaphrenic angle cut off, but no obvious
   pneumothorax, persistent RUL infiltrate, small b/l pleural effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old man with PMH DLBCL, hypoxemic respiratory failure and now
   ARF. Pathology from RUL infiltrate is inconclusive so will continue
   broad spectrum antibiotics and steroids for now. With negative serology
   and stains, fungal infection seems increasingly unlikely. Would like
   to DC ambisome today (particularly in light of ARF). Continues with low
   level pressor requirement but on sig. sedation. CVP running somewhat
   low but  SVV wnl,
   vascular pedicle width ~70mm on , grossly anasarcic on exam so doubt
   utility of additional volume. Oxygenation remains an issue, would
   continue low tidal volume ventilation
   and minmize PEEP ([**12-24**] pneumothorax). Aim TBB even to slightly negative
   today with goal CVP 4-6. Repeat chest CT today. Today is day 3 of 125
   q6hrs of solumedrol,
   will switch to 60mg prednisone in the morning. Further plans as per
   resident note.
