TITLE:  CCU INTERN PROGRESS NOTE
   Chief Complaint: Afib with RVR
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient given 20mg IV Lasix upon arrival to the floor as she was felt
   to have pulmonary edema secondary to volume overload in the setting of
   atrial fibrillation.  She urinated approximately 1200ml and her
   breathing improved.  She was transitioned from BiPap to facemask to
   nasal cannula.  She continues to cough intermittently, and has improved
   slightly with guaifenesin.
   She was rate-controlled with a diltiazem drip and metoprolol 50mg po
   qid.  She intially came with HR
s in the 120
s to 130
s, now with HRs
   in the 60
s.  She feels slightly dizzy this morning when sitting up,
   and her blood pressure is 81/51 at this time.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 7264**] M. [**Known patient lastname 7265**] is 71 year-old woman with pior history of
   [**Doctor Last Name 3415**] disease, DM, HTN, dyslipidemia admitted for atrial fib/flutter
   with RVR and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Paient with Afib/flutter with RVR. She is asymptomatic and
   has been maintaining her pressures. She failed 10 mg IV metoprolol x2,
   successfuly converted to sinus rhythm after cardioversion for a few
   seconds, but recurred.   Now she is rate-controlled with HR in the 60
   on diltiazem drip and metoprolol 50mg po qid.
   - Wean diltiazem drip as BP with MAPS in the 50
s this am
   - Increase Metoprolol 50 mg QID (double of home dose) to 75 mg
   metoprolol QID; discussed with endocrine non-selective beta-blocker and
   decided benefit would be minimal in short-term.
   - Continue Heparin gtt for anticoagulation
 likely transition to
   Coumadin for chronic anticoagulation
   - Patient less likely to benefit from cardioversion, and she was
   briefly in sinus rhythm yesterday and reverted back to Afib
   - ECHO today to r/o structural heart disease
   - If no CAD, consider sotalol, flecainide, or propefenone for
   anti-arrythmia as she may benefit from sinus rhythm
will consult EP
   today for their opinion
   - Continue heparin gtt pending EP recs of cardioversion possibility
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Patient with acute pulmonary edema in the
   setting of fluid overload in the ER and AFib with RVR.  Now with some
   residual coughing but on nasal cannula.
   - Diuresis prn with Lasix 20 mg IV for any recurrent SOB
   - Treat cough with prn ipratropium nebs and guiafenesin cough syrup prn
   - Rate control her as above
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF.
   .
   #. CAD - No known CAD, and no evidence that Afib is from ischemia.
   .
   # [**Doctor Last Name 3415**] Disease - Patient with [**Doctor Last Name 3415**] disease that stopped methimazole
   1 year ago. Her TSH has been progresively decreasing.  At this time her
   TSH is low, but with normal T3, free T4, and total t4.  Endocrine
   initially recommended methimazole due to low TSH, but felt that since
   her thyroid hormone levels were normal, thyroid disease likely did not
   precipitate her Afib.  She has been asymptomatic of any thyroid
   disease.
   - Appreciate endocrine recs
   - Metoprolol as above, will likely also treat thyroid disease if this
   is a precipitating factor
   .
   #. DM2 - Re-starting metformin at home-dose and will add ISS.
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt on dilt and metoprolol for now. Holding enalapril
   and HCTZ.
   .
   #. Smoking - Doing nicotine patch and social work.
   .
   #. Dyslipidemia - Continuing home-dose statin.
   .
   #. OA - Stable.
