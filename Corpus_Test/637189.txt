   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known patient lastname 2746**] is a [**Age over 90 304**] yo woman with hx of HIT, ESRD on HD, s/p b/l AKA
   presents with respiratory failure secondary to ?pneumonia.  Complicated
   by severe heart failure physiology.  Unable to wean off vent or
   pressors.
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient s/p 8 days of vanco/cefepime.  Her mental
   status has not been a barrier to extubation.  She has rapid shallow
   breathing with SBTs with Vt less than 100 on PS 5/5.  Not improving
   despite removing fluid through CVVH.  DFA for flu negative.
   - cont PS trials
   - chest PT/suctioning prn
   - patient not making much progress and will discuss long term decision
   making with family in meeting tomorrow at 230om
   .
   Shock. Patient presented with what was thought to be septic shock due
   to pneumonia.  Patient is s/p 8 days of vanco/cefepime for VAP.  Also
   has likely line infection, though fem line is now removed.  [**Month (only) 56**] have
   element of cardiogenic shock given her function AS in setting of
   tachycardia.  Patient had 20 point cortisol response with [**Last Name (un) 43**]-stim
   test.  Patient is failing to wean off the pressors, and now no longer
   has arterial access.  Cannot get accurate blood pressure with the cuff
   either.
   - cont pressors at current level, titrate to mental status for now as
   cannot assess BP, urine output or heart rate (as pt has stable
   tachycardica and PAF)
   - attempt to look for arterial access in L groin today, although was
   site of infection and very high risk
   - linezolid for Enterococcus line infection, line has been removed
   - cont levofed and vasopressin, no need to try and wean today
   - CVVH for volume removal
   .
   Enteroccus line infection.  Tip of femoral line positive for
   enteroccus.  Line has been removed.  Leukocytosis trending down.
   - linezolid for 7 day course post-removal of line (day 1 [**6-13**]) until
   [**6-20**]
   - f/u Enterococcus sensitivities - VRE
   - trend WBC and fever curve, has been afebrile
   .
   G-tube bleeding-bleeding upon residual check. Pink in color.
   -Hct trending down slightly, not quickly
   -[**Hospital1 **] PPI
   -guaiac stool
   - tx for hct <21
   .
   Heart failure/functional AS.  Most recent echo shows severe AS, but per
   cards, likely functional due to low EF, poor filling times.  Anticipate
   some improvement with rate control. Initially there was improvement of
   HR with dig, butnow more tachycardic in setting of volume removal.
   - digoxin for rate control
   - consider cardioversion if unable to wean from pressors
   .
   PAF. cont dig, appreciate cards recs
   .
   HIT.  HIT was diagnosed in [**10/2561**] and complicated by thrombus in b/l
   lower extrem requiring amputations.  Currently on agratroban, but
   coumadin has not been restarted.
   - NO HEPARIN PRODUCTS
   - Hold coumadin for now given acute infectious setting; consider
   resuming post-extubation
   - continue argatroban, has been therapeutic
   .
   ESRD on HD.  Currently on CVVH, appreciate renal recs
   - CVVH with goal net negative
   - follow TID lytes
   - follow renal recs
   .
   Anemia.  Stable.  Likely secondary chronic disease and blood loss from
   blood draws and procedure.  Also has neck hematoma where IJ was
   attempted and has guaiac positive stools.  Also, small amount of blood
   in NGT suctioning as well.
   -trend HCT
   -active T+S
   .
   CAD. Patient had NSTEMI in [**2561**].  EF of 20% on most recent echo.
   - no ASA
   - no BB given pressor requirement
   - continue statin
   .
   Hypothyroid.  TSH wnl during this hospitalization.
   - continue IV levothyroxine
