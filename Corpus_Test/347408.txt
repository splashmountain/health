   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o man with PMH notable for Hx of R focal seizures with
   hyperperfusion syndrome, CAD s/p CABG, recent carotid endarterectomy,
   and type 2 DM admitted with seizures X 3 earlier today.
   .
   # Seizures: the patient does have a history of right focal motor
   seizures following his first carotid endarterectomy in [**3106**] and was on
   dilantin for a period of time (unclear for how long). He apparently
   never had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure at that time. For this
   episodes, differential includes infectious, stroke, toxic metabolic,
   and primary seizure disorder. No acute hemmorrhage on CT head, multiple
   hypodensities sound chronic. No hypoglycemia, electrolytes WNL. CSF
   with mild elevated protein, NL glucose, no WBC/RBC. Lactate 10 on
   admission likely [**1-10**] seizure, 1 on repeat on arrival to the ICU.
   - MRI/MRA brain and neck to eval for CVA
   - neuro recs appreciated
   - Covered with Vanco, CTX, AMP, acyclovir. CSF only showed mild
   elevation of protein (ddx: Viral, lyme, and neurosyphilis). Can now d/c
   Vanco, CTX, AMP. Continue Acyclovir pending HSV pcr result .
   - EEG monitoring overnight (in progress)
   - Dilantin loaded in ED, additional 500mg in divided doses today, 100
   TID [**11-12**] with dilantin level in [**11-12**] am.
   - seizure precautions
   - d/c fentanyl and versed as soon as possible, add back low dose
   propofol if necessary.
   - pt is on bualbital-APAP-Caffeine which can cause withdraw seizures if
   suddenly stoped, however as per nursing home notes has not been
   consistantly getting med.
   - f/u CSF, UA and urine cultures
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in ED. Likely
   extubation tomorrow AM after studies & seizures under control.
   - titrate vent by ABGs
   - wean sedation in AM if possible with RSBI and SBT if possible
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: Resolved on repeat ABG on arrival to the ICU.
   .
   # Transaminitis: ? etiology. Trend in AM.
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Renal consulted and appreciate their recs. Plan for HD
   tomorrow.
   - continue nephrocaps, calcitriol, and Phoslo
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Not hypoglycemic currently. HISS.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct near recent baseline. Has active T&S. Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Near baseline. Continue to trend.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hypotensive with propofol, increasing as sedation
   weaned. Holding Metoprolol, nifedipine, diovan, imdur for now, add back
   as sedation titrated and BP allows.
   .
   #CAD: continue ASA and Statin. No acute EKG changes. Repeat CEs in the
   AM (2 sets 12 hours apart).
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now. (diet at facility no potatoes, tomatoes, oranges,
   or bananas due to renal disease). replete lytes prn.
   .
   # PPx: hep sc tid, BM reg, ISS
   .
   #Access: R fem line, R wrist PIV, R antecub PIV. IF BP stable overnight
   d/c fem line in am.
   .
   # CODE: full code, confirmed with patient's wife who is hcp
   .
   # COMM: With patient and family. Wife [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 4016**] is HCP, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4017**]
   (home), [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4018**] (cell). Son [**Name (NI) 2438**] [**Name (NI) 4016**] is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4019**].
