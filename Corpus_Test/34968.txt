Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 645**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, palpitations

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**3403-2-23**] Tricuspid Valve repair utilizing a 34mm annuplasty ring
with LV lead placement
.
[**3403-2-25**] Insertion of [**Company 55**] dual chamber permanent pacemaker,

History of Present Illness:
This is a 59 year old female with history of polymyositis, who
was recently sent in for evaluation of tachy-brady syndrome.
Over past month prior to admission, she reported having
intermittent chest tightness and palpitations. These episodes
lasted approximately 10-40 minutes. She also complained of
intermittent dyspnea and decreased exercise tolerance. She also
reported episodes in which she feels lightheaded and a sensation
of warmth, but denies any dizziness or loss of consciousness.
Subsequent cardiac MRI revealed worsening tricuspid
regurgitation with RA/RV enlargement and also some mitral
regurgitation. Given above findings, cardiac surgery was
consulted and further evaluation was performed. After routine
preoperative evaluation, she was eventually cleared to proceed
with surgical intervention.


Past Medical History:
- Gallbladder polyps
- Polymyositis - biopsy proven. Has refused treatment in the
past due to side effects of prednisone
- Recent Pneumonia, one month prior to admission

Pulmonary edema has not recurred and pulmonary vascular
engorgement has improved. Severe cardiomegaly is stable. Small
right and moderate left pleural effusion are stable, left lower
lobe collapse is more pronounced. No pneumothorax. Transvenous
right ventricular pacer lead may pass into the coronary sinus,
but it does not traverse the ring of the tricuspid valve

Conclusions

No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-17**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results on [**3403-2-23**] at 945am.
Post bypass
Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine.
LVEF= 50%. Annuloplasty ring seen in the tricuspid position. It
appears well seated . There is trivial tricuspid regurgitation
and no stenosis. Aorta is intact post decannulation. The mitral
regurgitation is trivial.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] was a same day admission to the operating room for
tricuspid valve repair along with placement of a left
ventricular lead, please see operative report for details. In
summary patient had:
1. Tricuspid repair using an [**Doctor Last Name 646**] MC3 annuloplasty ring,
model number 4900.
2. Left ventricular epicardial lead placement x2.
3. Atrial tissue biopsy.
4. Mediastinal reexploration
Her bypass time was35 minutes with a crossclamp time of 24
minutes.

Following re-operation, she was brought to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, she awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated without incident. She maintained stable
hemodynamics and underwent placement of dual chamber [**Company 55**]
pacemaker on postoperative day two. She tolerated the procedure
well without complication. Following pacemaker implantation, she
transferred to the cardiac stepdown floor for further care and
recovery. She experienced brief episodes of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation but ultimately was apaced. Beta blockade was
started and advanced as tolerated. Over several days, she
continued to make clinical improvement with diuresis and she was
medically cleared for discharge to rehabilitation on
postoperative day five. Prior to discharge, pacemaker underwent
interrogation and was found to be functioning within normal
limits. At discharge, incisional pain was well controlled on
Ultram.
Follow up appointments were outlined in discharge paperwork.
