The patient was taken to the operating room on [**3060-9-4**]
to undergo an aortic valve replacement with a 23 mm
[**Last Name (un) 1768**]-[**Doctor Last Name 529**] bioprosthetic valve and coronary artery
bypassgrafting times two, specifically saphenous vein grafts to
the
left anterior descending, right posterolateral. The
cardiopulmonary bypass time was 168 minutes, cross clamp time
was 130 minutes. Two atrial and two ventricular wires were place
in addition to three chest tubes, one mediastinal, one
mediastinal right and one left pleural. The patient tolerated
the procedure extremely well and was transferred to cardiac
intensive care unit. The patient was extubated shortly after
surgery; aterial blood gas post extubation with consistent with
good ventilation and perfusion of both lungs. On post op day one
the patient remained in the CRSU and was delined. His chest
tubes were removed, diet was advanced, aggressive pulmonary
therapy was employed to improve lung ventilation. The patient
worked with physical therapy on transferring from his bed to a
chair. The patient's pain was well controlled with intravenous
morphine and he was deemed ready for the regular hospital floor.
Prior to being transferred to the floor the patient experienced
some agitation during the night and was treated with haldol. On
postop day two the patient continued to be slightly confused
while in the CRSU however his cordis and pacing wires were
removed and he was transferred to the regular hospital floor in
stable condition. Specifically, his pain was well controlled and
he was tolerating a regular diet. On post op day three the
patient worked very well with physical therapy and ambulated
with minimal assistance. On postop day four the patient was
deemed level five after walking up a flight of stairs and around
the floor. The patient became progressively less agitated during
his hospital stay on the regular floor. He was put back on his
home medications while on the floor and tolerated them well
without any untoward events. The patient was discharged home on
the morning of postop day five with cardiopulmonary nursing
services. He has an appointment to see Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in [**3-22**]
