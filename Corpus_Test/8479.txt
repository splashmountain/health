CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chest pain
.
EVENTS / HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: [**Age over 90 **] year old male with
CAD (s/p CABG and multiple stents to the venous grafts),
hypertension, type II diabetes, and chronic renal insufficency
who presented with suddent onset chest pain and respiratory
distress starting at 6a.m. on day of admission. The patient felt
this was the same type of pain as his past myocardial
infarction. The patient did not have nausea or vomiting.
.
In the ED, vital signs were as follows: HR-108-120, BP:
128-254/100-164, RR: 32, O2sat: 93-100% on CPAP at 5cm H20. On
exam, patient was diaphoretic with cool extremities, there was
JVD, bibasilar rales, and bilateral pedal edema. EKG showed ST
elevations in aVR and V1-V3. Cardiac enzymes showed a CPK of
125, MB-8, and Trop T 0.21. The patient was given morphine,
Aspirin 325mg, metoprolol, Plavix 600mg, integrillin, heparin
drip, nitro drip, Lasix 40mg. The patient continued to have
respiratory distress an arterial blood gas showed a ph of 7.15,
pC02 of 54, and a pO2 of 74 and was therefore intubated with an
8.0 ETT with ventilator settings of Assist control mode with a
respiratory rate of 12, tidal volume of 550ml, and PEEP of 7.5,
and FiO2 of 100% and an NG tube was placed. He was then brought
urgently to the catheterization lab.
On review of symptoms, he was intubated/sedated and unable to
obtain history.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN, AS REVIEWED AND DISCUSSED IN MULTI
DISCIPLINARY ROUNDS : Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man with a
history of CAD (s/p CABG and mult. stent placements), type II
diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented with
chest pain and shortness of breath and found to have an ST
elevation myocardial infarction based on EKG and cardiac
enzymes.  Status post cardiac catheterization with thrombectomy
and balloon angioplasty of the SBG-OM graft.
.
CAD/STEMI:  Patient is s/p cardiac cath with thrombectomy and
balloon angioplasty of the SBG-OM graft.  Cardiac enzymes were
cycled with a peak CPK of 773 and a peak CK-MB of 95.  The fact
that the patient had thrombosis of a bare metal stent in the
SBG-OM graft while on a home dose aspirin and Plavix is
concerning for some sort of hypercoagulable state.  The patient
was therefore started on Plavix 75mg PO BID.  The patient was
continued on aspirin 325 mg daily, continued on Integrilin for
18 hours after catheterization, atorvastatin 80 mg, and a nitro
drip (which was later weaned.)  Metoprolol was titrated up to 75
mg PO TID.  The patient was also started on isosorbide 30mg TID.
 An ACE inhibitor was held until hospital day 4 because of the
history of chronic renal insufficiency and the recent cardiac
catheterization dye load.  The lisinopril then was started and
titrated up to 20mg Daily.  A lipid panel showed and HDL of 37
and LDL of 62,
.
Pump/CHF: Patient has history of LVEF of 50% with diastolic
dysfunction repeat ECHO showed and an ejection fraction of 20%
with inferior, septal, and anterior hypokinesis. On admission
exam, the patient had bilateral crackles and pedal edema.
Admission chest x-ray showed infiltrates.  Therefore the patient
was given Lasix 20mg IV for three days.  The patient was 4.5
liters negative for the length of stay with decreasing oxygen
requirement (now on room air) and resolved pedal edema.  The
patient will be discharged on his home dose of Lasix 20mg PO
Daily.  The patient was maintained on a beta blocker and an ACE
inhibitor was started on hospital day 4.
.
Rhythm:  Patient stayed in normal sinus rhythm.  Occasional
premature atrial beats.
.
Resp: On admission to the CCU, the patient was
intubated/sedated. The ventilator setting were weaned and the
patient passed a pressure support trial.  An arterial blood gas
before extubation showed a ph of 7.45, pCO2 of 40, and pO2 of
90.  On the evening of admission, the patient was extubated
successfully.  Since that time the patient has had decreasing
oxygen requirement and was discharged on room air.
.
Hypotension: On transport from the cath lab, the patient became
bradycardic and hypotensive (SBP to the 80's.) The patient was
given atropine with good response. The patient was also started
on a neosynephrine drip which was quickly weaned. This episode
was thought to be due to a post-cath vaso-vagal event or recent
administration of propofol. There was concern from a cardiac
tamponade and/or ACS an ECHO was rapidly performed and ruled
this out.  The patient did not have any more hypotensive
episodes.
.
Respiratory Acidosis: ABG on admission showed a ph of 7.20 pCO2
of 58, and pO2 of 314 consistent with respiratory acidosis. The
respiratory rate was increased and repeat ABG showed a pH of
7.47, pCO2 of 29, and pO2 of 193.
.
DM type II:  A HbA1c was 5.8%.  The patient was maintained on an
insulin sliding scale.  The patient was restarted on his home
dose of glipized before discharge.
.
ID/Fever:  On [**3161-7-22**], the patient had rectal temperature to
102.4.  The patient was started on a course of levofloxacin for
possible pneumonia (equivocal infiltrate on CXR).  Blood
cultures were negative and and urine cultures grew enterococcus
sensitive to ampicillin, nitrofuratoin, and vancomycin.  The
patient was started on a 10 day course of amoxicillin on [**3161-7-25**]
and remained afebrile throughout the rest of his stay.
.
Renal Function: Patient has history of chronic renal
insufficiency with a baseline Cr of 1.8-2.0, and received
Acetylcysteine x2 after catheterization.  His renal function
remained stable and he is discharged on lisinopril 20mg.
.
Hematuria: Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] developed hematura on aspirin, Plavix,
heparin, and Integrilin.   Because of clots, urology was
consulted and a 3 way catheter was placed and irrigated.  The
catheter was removed the next day w/o complication and he was
urinating wihtout difficulty on discharge.
.
Prophy: The patient was maintained on a bowel regimen, proton
pump inhibitor, and Heparin SQ.
.
Access: Right SCV line was placed on [**3161-7-22**] and removed on
[**3161-7-24**].  Patient had peripheral IV access at that time.

.
Dispo: The patient was discharged to the floor on [**3161-7-26**].  The
patient was seen by physical therapy and sent home with
services.  The patient will follow up with his cardiologist and
primary care doctor.
