History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known patient lastname 26538**] is a 52M with recent admission for Vtach [**3-2**] QT
prolongation s/p ICD placement and h/o narcotics abuse who
presented to [**Hospital1 4**] [**Location (un) **] for SOB concerning for COPD
exacerbation as well as N/V and was found to have QT
prolondation to 510.  He was given steroids, abx, zofran.  He
was given mag sulfate 2g IV preemptively for long QT of 510, Mg
1.8 and plans were made for admission for COPD exacerbation.
Shortly after Mag was hung, pt reports feeling short of breath
and lightheaded and had a witnessed episode of torsades, with
subsequent ICD firing. He was given lidocaine 100mg IV, 1mg drip
which was increased to 2mg.  He had 4 episodes total.  Per [**Hospital1 **]
cards, pacer rate was increased to 80 and he was transferred to
[**Hospital1 4**] for further management.
.
On arrival to our ED, vitals were 97.9 80 146/111 17 100% ra.
Labs were notable for phos of 1.8 and K of 3.3 without any other
abnormalities.  QTc was 460.  He was given additional Mg, 40meq
K in IVF, Ativan for anxiety and nausea.  Lidocaine was
continued.  He had another episodes of torasdes and his ICD
fired for the second time.  On transfer to the CCU, VS:  HR 92,
150/99, 20 98% 2L NC.
.
Currently, the patient denies any symptoms other than
significant diffuse chest pressure which he experienced both
after the first ICD firing and following the second ICD firing.
He continues to experience the chest pressure/pain without
change.  He denies shortness of breath or lightheadedness,
denies arm or jaw pain, n/v.
.
Of note, the patient does note he had been experiencing green
loose stool x1-2 days, abdominal pain, and nausea/vomiting.  He
reports experiencing these same symptoms every other week since
his gastric bypass, and denies any sick contacts, unusual food
intake, fevers, or changes to his typical GI symptoms.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of baseline
dyspnea on exertion or exertional chest pain or pressure,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations.

.
[**2957-1-25**] ECG
Atrial paced, ventricular sensed rhythm with atrial premature
beats. Since the
previous tracing the atrial pacing then was associated with a P
wave and there
is no longer ventricular pacing. Perhaps the pateint was in
atrial
fibrillation on the prior two tracings. Clinical correlation is
suggested.
.
[**2957-1-26**] ECG
Atrial paced, ventricular sensed rhythm with a single atrial
premature beat.
Since the previous tracing the Q-T interval is shorter.
Otherwise, unchanged.



Brief Hospital Course:
52 yo gentleman with history of ventricular arrhythmias in the
setting of prolonged QT presents with torsades and ICD firing in
the setting of medication prolonging QT.
.
# RHYTHM:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 26538**] presented in [**Month (only) 435**] in the setting
of prolonged QT, believed to be secondary to Zofran and had an
ICD placed during that time.  He presented again dyspneic and
developed torsades de [**Last Name (un) **] after receiving zofran.  QT
interval was 510 at outside hospital and 460 in [**Hospital1 4**] ED after
receiving magnesium repletion prior to transfer.  Episodes of
torsades appear to be provoked by QT-prolonging medications, and
threshold may also have been lowered by electrolyte
abnormalities.  He was additionally repleted with magnesium and
potassium and was initially put on a lidocaine drip for
continued anti-arrythmic effect overnight. Daily EKGs performed
to monitor QT interval. He was discharged with close follow up
and no changes were made to his medications.  He was instructed
to continue avoiding QT prolonging medications.
.
# CORONARIES: On recent catheterization prior to admission, no
intervenable lesions however patient  with several narrowed
vessels as well as evidence of microvascular disease.  No
history of chest pain on admission and cardiac enzymes cycled
and were unremarkable.  He was continued on aspirin, statin ,
betablocker and ace inhibitor at home dose.
.
# Chronic CHF: History of mild systolic CHF  post-torsades (last
EF 45%). Euvolemic on admission without evidence of
exacerbation.  He was continued on home dose of betablocker and
lisinopril and put on a low sodium diet.
.
# HTN: Mildly blood pressures on admission.  He was continued on
home regimen as outlined above.
.
# HLD: Continued Simvastatin.
.
# Thrush:  White plaque on tongue consistent with flush. He was
started on nystatin swish and swallow.
.
# Hx COPD/Asthma: No wheeze or evidence of active flare.
Albuterol, flovent and ventolin were available.
.
# Depression/Anxiety: He was continued on celexa daily with
ativan as needed.  He was encouraged to follow-up with his
primary care physician and former psychiatrist to address
underlying anxiety.
.
# Chronic pain: Continued on tylenol and cyclobenzaprine for
chronic pain in setting of past history of narcotics abuse.

Ventricular Tachycardia/Torsades de Pointes related to prolonged

QT interval
Acute Systolic Dysfunction


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker
or cane).


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for management of an abnormal
cardiac rhythm, ventricular tachycardia or torsades de pointes
that caused your internal cardiac defibrillator (ICD)to fire.
This abnormal rhythm was likely caused by a medication that you
took for symptoms of nausea (zofran). You should avoid any
medicines
that make you more prone to ventricular tachycardia, please
continue to avoid these medications, you have been given a list
of these medications.

No changes were made to your medications.

Weigh yourself every morning, please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 763**] if
