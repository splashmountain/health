Pertinent Results:
[**3244-9-21**] Intra-op TEE
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focalities
in inferior, inferoseptal wall and lateral wall.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric,
posteriorly directed jet of Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Restricted posterior leafletThere is no
pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results before
surgical incision. Dr.[**First Name (STitle) 1691**] concurred with the findings.
Post_Bypass:
Normal RV systolic function.
Overall LVEF 35%.
The mitral prosthesis is intact with no perivalvular leaks. Mean
gradient across the mitral prosthesis was 5mm of Hg.
Intact thoracic aorta.

[**3244-9-27**] Chest x-ray:
As compared to the previous radiograph, the right venous
introduction sheath has been removed. The lung volumes have
increased, likely to reflect improved ventilation. However,
bilateral pleural effusions are still present, but are slightly
less extensive than on the previous image. No evidence of
pulmonary edema. No pneumonia. Minimal atelectasis at the lung
bases. Normal alignment of the sternal wires.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**3244-9-21**] where
the patient underwent CABG x 2 (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM), Mitral Valve
Relacement with On-X mechanical valve and Left Atrial Appendage
ligation.   Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in critical but
stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  She left
the OR on vasopressin, epiinephrine and levophed.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamics improved. She was extubated on POD 1 and was
weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support by POD 2.  Beta
blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward
the preoperative weight.  Coumadin was started on POD 2 for the
mechanical valve, she was bridged with Heparin.  The patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery on POD
5.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  [**Last Name (un) 93**] was consulted for assistance with blood
glucose management.  Insulin was adjusted accordingly.  The
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD 7 the patient was ambulating freely, the [**Last Name (un) 5327**] was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged home in good condition with appropriate
follow up instructions.  She developed a phlebitis on her right
hand and was started on Keflex.
