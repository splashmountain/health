Chief Complaint:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   56yo woman with ESRD [**1-11**] membranous GN s/p failed txplant in [**2535**] on
   low-dose immunosuppression now on PD for ~1 year, rectal sarcoma s/p
   surgery / XRT, histiocytosis X s/p thymectomy, goiter here with several
   days of cough, nausea, vomiting and shortness of breath. Found to be
   very hypertensive (~250/110) and CXR c/w volume overload. She received
   Levaquin, Vanc, and Ceftriaxone for a possible LLL pneumonia. She was
   started on IV Labetalol but became bradycardic so was started on
   Nitroprusside. Renal saw her and initiated emergent PD.

   Assessment and Plan
   56yo woman with ESRD [**1-11**] membranous GN s/p failed txplant in [**2535**] on
   low-dose immunosuppression now on PD for ~1 year, rectal sarcoma s/p
   surgery / XRT, histiocytosis X s/p thymectomy, goiter here with several
   days of cough, nausea, vomiting and shortness of breath found to have
   significant hypertension.
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
   Volume overload is likely contributing to her presentation and azotemia
   could explain her nausea / vomiting. She is responding well to
   aggressive PD. She is on appropriate renal medications, including
   Cellcept and Prednisone. Appreciate Renal recs and assistance.
 DYSPNEA (SHORTNESS OF BREATH)
   Likely [**1-11**] pulmonary edema given her clinical context and radiographic
   presentation. There is not compelling evidence for a significant
   pulmonary infection, PE or another acute process. Her SOB has improved
   with dialysis; I would favor stopping her antibiotics given there is no
   fever, leukocytosis or symptoms of pneumonia.
 HYPERTENSION, MALIGNANT (HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS, HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY)
   The etiology of her significant hypertension is likely [**1-11**] nausea and
   vomiting preventing her taking her oral meds as well as some volume
   oerload. Her BP has responded well to the combination of nitroprusside
   IV, nitroglycerine paste and Amlodipine as well as aggressive PD. We
   will titrate down her nitroprusside and d/c
 the nitropaste. We will
   re-introduce her home meds while controlling her nausea with
   symptomatic meds and continued dialysis. Goal SBP ~150-160mmHg.
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Her Hct has fluctuated during this hospitalization, with a nadir of
   ~22% that responded appropriately to a unit of pRBCs. No e/o acute
   clinically significant bleeding. Most likely she has some degree of
   gastritis and inflammation in the setting of her acute presentation
   accounting for her emesis being guaiac positive. Will follow her Hct
   [**Hospital1 **].
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now with nausea / vomiting
 will advance diet as
   tolerated.
