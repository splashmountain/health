Chief Complaint:  Chest Pain
   HPI:
   64 y/o gentleman with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia,
   PAF woke up this morning around 3:45 AM with severe SSCP with radiation
   to back.  Patient had associated diaphoresis, N and vomitting.  He
   walked across to [**Hospital1 17**] [**Location (un) 239**] and was found to be in anterior STEMI.
   He was given ASA 324mg, Plavix 600mg, Integrillin bolus, Heparin 7500u
   and a sl nitro with no change in symptom.  He was transferred to
   [**Hospital1 17**]-[**Location (un) 21**] cath lab for emergent cardiac catheterization.  On arrival
   he was awake and alert, and chest pain free.  Integrillin gtt was
   started.
   .
   During cardiac catheterization he was found to have mid LAD lesion and
   recieved Xience x 2.  LV gram showed LVEF of 45% with moderate
   anterolateral hypokinesis.  His angioseal was unsuccessful and was
   placed on clamp.  Patient was transfered to CCU for further management.
   .
   On arrival patient was asymptomatic.  On review of systems, he denies
   any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
   embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains,
   cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
   chills or rigors. All of the other review of systems were negative.
   .
   Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
   exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
   palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

   CARDIAC CATH:
   1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
   demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease.  The RCA had
   minimal irregularities but was free from angiographically significant
   disease. The LMCA was normal without flow limiting stenosis.  The LAD
   was patent proximally, and had a 95% mid vessel stenosis just prior to
   a large diagonal branch.  The LCx had minimal luminal irregularities
   but was from from angiographically significant disease.
   2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided filling
   pressure with LVEDP of 19mmHg.  The central aortic pressure was
   normotensive at 132/81 mmHg.
   3. Left ventriculography revealed no mitral regurgitation.  The LVEF
   was calculated to be 45% with moderate anterolateral hypokinesis.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Moderate systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o gentleman with DM, HTN, HL presented with anterior STEMI s/p PCI
   to mid LAD.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Anterior STEMI s/p PCI to mid LAD, Xience x 2.
   - continue ASA 325, plavix 75
   - continue metoprolol, consider switching lisinopril to captopril and
   uptitrate for positive LV remodelling
   - atorvastatin 80 mg daily
   - PT when transfered to the floor
   - needs to be admitted for 72 hours post PCI
   .
   # PUMP:  Currently appears euvolumic.  Ant HK with LVEF of 45% in EF in
   LV gram.
   - TTE tomorrow
   - daily weights and strict I&O
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Currently in sinus rhythm.  History of PAF after knee
   replacement in the past.
   - telemonitoring
   - CHADS 3, consider anticoagulation once femoral access site is stable.
   .
   # Failed angioseal:
   - post cath check
   - trend HCT
