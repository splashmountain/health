Chief Complaint:  Presented to ED with Suicidal Ideation
   HPI:
   This is a 60 year old male with PMH significant for malignant HTN,
   Venous Thromboembolism and PE s/p IVC filter, history of heroin abuse
   on methadone maintenance who presented to ED initially complaining of
   suicidal ideation and was noted to be somnolent.  Patient was placed in
   psych ED for evaluation and was placed on tele, HR noted to be in 30s
   and patient noted to be increasingly more somnolent.  Tox screen was
   done and was positive for benzos, Opiates and Methadone.  ECG done and
   notable for prolonged QTc of .52.  Toxicology was consulted and concern
   was for QT prolongation from Seroquel/Methadone.    He was given 0.4 of
   Narcan out of concern for opiate overdose.  He was also give glucagon
   for concern of beta-blocker overdose, given history of bradycardia with
   beta-blockers.  Patient was transferred to MICU for further monitoring
   of QTc.
   In the ED:  V/S Temp 98.4  HR 52  BP 194/80  RR 18  100% RA.  As above,
   noted to be increasingly somnolent with bradycardia and prolonged QTc.
   He was given Glucagon 1mg IV x 1, Zofran 4mg IV x 1 and Narcan 0.4 IV x
   1.
   On arrival to the MICU, patient continued to be somnolent but able to
   answer questions.  He denied any current suicidal ideation but did
   report increasing depression [**2-25**] to lack of cymbalta medication.  He
   denied any recent fevers, chills, chest pain, dyspnea, SOB, N/V or
   diarrhea.  He does report bloody sputum which has been ongoing for many
   months.  He also reports abdominal pain which began today.  He was
   requesting Methadone for withdrawal.  Of note, patient was found to
   have Klonapin and Clonidine pill bottles hiding in his underwear.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 year old male with PMH significant for malignant HTN,
   Venous Thromboembolism and PE s/p IVC filter, history of heroin abuse
   on methadone maintenance who presented to ED initially complaining of
   suicidal ideation and was noted to be somnolent and bradycardic.
   Admitted for drug intoxication, bradycardia.
   1)  Drug Intoxication/Bradycardia:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 2314**] presented with SI,
   also noted to be somnolent and bradycardic.  He had a similar episode
   one month ago where he was admitted after being found down, and also
   found to be bradycardic and intoxicated.  Bradycardia at that time
   presumed to be [**2-25**] to opiate/benzo overdose.  Patient presents
   similarly today.  On floor he was found to be hiding Klonapin and
   Clonidine bottles in his underwear.  He also attempted to smuggle
   Klonapin on his last admission.  It seems likely that his current
   bradycardia is also due to Opiate/Benzo/Methadone overdose.  It is
   unclear at this time as to the amounts he ingested today.  ECG was also
   reviewed and QT interval seems normal, although bradycardic.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Serial ECGs
   - Transcutaneous pacer pads in place
   - Mg PRN torsades
   - Hold Methadone, Klonapin, Quetiapine
   2) Hypertension:  Patient with history of malignant HTN, usually in
   setting of non-compliance with Clonidine patch.  Patient without patch
   on arrival to floor today, hypertensive to SBP 190s.
   - restart Clonidine patch
   - hold oral meds till less somnolent
   - PRN Hydralazine with goal SBP 160s
   - likely restart Amlodipine, HCTZ in AM
   3) PE s/p IVC filter: No issues currently.  Patient with c/o blood
   tinged sputum since PE, no cough on arrival.  Will monitor.  HCT
   stable.
   - Heparin SQ
   4)  COPD
 cont home tiotropium.
   - Albuterol nebs PRN
   5) Anxiety/Depression:  Patient c/o SI on arrival to ED, but denied SI
   on arrival to MICU.  Will hold Quetiapine.
   - cont Cymbalta
   - Psych consult in AM
