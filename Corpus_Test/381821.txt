   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU for Ultrafiltration after
   failing to increase UOP on aggressive diuretic regimen with very active
   LGIB overnight.
   #. Leukocytosis: Concerned for occult sepsis given prolonged hospital
   course and hypotension.
   -          Will check U/A, Bcx, Ucx, cxr, and C.Diff
   -          Will treat with abx if necessary
   -          Continue to trend white count
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: s/p RH cath showing elevated
   RV, LV pressures but no elevated pulmonary pressures (thus making the
   concern for idiopathic pulm HTN unlikely). Continued on Vasopressin
   with MAP of 64 (average).
   - goal fluid balance negative 3-4Liters today with UF
   -Continue vasopressin for hypotension with aggressive fluid removal as
   this will have no B1 activity and will not increase heart rate which
   would worsen her diastolic dysfunction.
   - Continue Phenylephrine. Will uptitrate as necessary so that can
   continue aggressive diuresis
   - Continue beta blocker for HR control given diastolic CHF will be
   worsened from tachycardia and want to give LV long enough time to
   fill.
   - Continue Ranolazine for diastolic dysfunction as some evidence this
   does improve diastolic CHF.
   - Continue fluid restriction
   - Will check CI today and trend.
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr now trending down possibly
   as result of better forward flow. Lytes suggested pre-renal. Likely
   secondary to poor forward flow from heart failure; urine microscopy not
   suggestive of ATN
   - UF as above, with aggressive diuresis
   - No need for dialysis now as electrolytes wnl
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renal is following
   # GI BLEEDING: History of UC. Status post clipping/injection of ulcers.
   Most likely precipitant for bleed is CHF. GI on board, rec monitoring
   HCT and if this decreases they may go in again to evaluate, however
   unlikely now that venous pressures are decreased.
   - Continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **], ferrous sulfate
   - PIV x2  plus CVL
   - Active T+S
   - Transfuse for hct < 22
   # PPX: heparin SC, PPI IV BID, holding bm regimen given diarrhea
   # ACCESS: PIVs, PICC placement [**2861-4-7**]

   # EMERGENCY CONTACT: [**Name (NI) **] is HCP: [**Name (NI) 804**] ([**0-0-**])

   ------ Protected Section ------
   Ultrafiltration is going well.  She has an elevated wbc and low
   systemic vascular resistance although no obvious infectious focus.  We
   will check cxr, bld and urine cultures.  No abx for now.
   I remain puzzled by her hemodynamics.  If her cardiac index is normal
   or supranormal, then why should she require ultrafiltration for volume
   regulation in the presence of presumably intact kidneys?
   For now, we will continue ranolazine for diastolic function, beta
   blocker to moderate heart rate, ultrafiltration (aggressive) to volume
   unload, ppi for ulcers.  Prognosis is uncertain at this time.  I am
   hoping that by aggressively volume unloading, her right heart will
   shrink down, the tricuspid regurgitation decrease, and her tendency for
   fluid avidity be reduced.
