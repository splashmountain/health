   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo M with h/o CHF (EF 20%), acute on chronic (stage IV) renal
   failure, recent GIB (h/o AVMs), in MICU with shock and respiratory
   failure.
   # Shock: - cardiogenic vs. combination of septic and cardiogenic.  Pt
   is back on dobutamine (at 5) for inotropic support and is currently on
   levophed (at 0.1).
   - no clear septic etiologies at this point.  Pt is on empiric
   vanco/zosyn, with vanc being dosed by level.  Pt on day 6 of zosyn.
   Will continue for one more day and then d/c abx if no infectious
   etiologies emerge.
   - urine cx with yeast x3; sputum cx ([**6-12**]) no growth; sputum cx ([**6-14**])
   contaminated; blood cx PENDING
   - for CHF, continue to follow pt
s fluid status and follow CXR
   - pt not longer on lasix gtt, as it was not having significant effect
   on his UOP
   - will wean down dobutamine gtt
 will obtain mixed venous O2 sat now
   and then trend this value as the dobutamine is decreased
   # Respiratory failure
 intubated, on AC [**7-27**].  Plan was to wean from
   vent several days ago, but pt with copious white, frothy oral
   secretions c/w pulm edema, as seen with cxr as well.  So, plan changed
   to diurese approximately 1 L negative with lasix gtt.  Lasix gtt
   stopped [**1-21**] low BP
s but then was restarted yesterday.  Stopped again
   after it had no real effect on pt
s UOP.
   - pt did not tolerate his RSBI
   - CXR ordered for this morning.  Will f/u to evaluate for changes in
   pt
s effusions or pulmonary edema
   - If pt eventually ex extubated, will need to take care secondary to
   her transudative pleural effusions and laryngeal edema.  Will need to
   be careful when extubating.
   - if fluid overload continues, will address possibility of CVVH
   # Anemia
 Hct rose to 27.6 (from 22.9) after 2 units of blood.  Now,
   Hct holding steady at 25.5.
   - ordered a Hct for 3pm
 will f/u
   - continue to trend pt
s Hct
   # Transudative effusions
 persistent
   - eventual diuresis versus repeat thoracentesis vs cvvh
   # Renal failure
 likely secondary to decreased renal perfusion
   - BUN steady at 88; Cr down slightly today to 5.1 (from 5.5)
   - UOP 390 mL total yesterday
   - renal dosing of meds
   - dose vanc by level
   # DM2
   - continue with insulin sliding scale and accuchecks.
   # Altered Mental Status
 difficult to assess [**1-21**] to patient being
   sedated
   # FEN: caution with IVF, replete electrolytes prn, on TF
