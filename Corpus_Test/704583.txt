   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), COLORECTAL (COLON CANCER)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   67 year old female with metastatic colon cancer C32D12 5-FU/Leucovorin
   presenting with nausea, vomiting and acute renal failure, now with
   bleeding from ostomy, hypotension and GNR bacteremia.
   .
   # Shock: Currently on pressors.  Likely distributive: sepsis w/ GNR in
   blood cx from [**2-20**].  [**Last Name (un) **] stim not consistent w/ adrenal insuff.
   Urine cx neg, first stool cx neg for c diff.
   -- Cont neo for map goal >65
   -- Cont broad spectrum abx for Vanco/[**Last Name (un) 411**]/flagyl
   -- F/u bcx, repeat stool cx r/o c diff, and send sputum
   .
   # High Ostomy output/diarrhea: Ostomy output has high. Stools negative
   for ovas/parasites and negative for c. diff x1. sent for cx and C.diff.
   -- Continue Octreotide, Opium Tincture, PPI, Rifaximin
   -- Repeat stool cx r/o c diff
   .
   # Elevated bilirubin: Direct bili elevated yesterday, currently within
   normal limits.  Hemolysis labs negative.  AP, ALT, AST not elevated.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline ~1.4-2.0. Improved with IVFs.
   -- Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds.
   .
   # RUE edema: prelim RUE US neg for DVT.
   -- F/u final read of US
   .
   # Anemia: S/p 3 units of PRBCs [**2-20**]. Currently hct stable and
   hemolysis labs negative.  Thought to have bleed from ostomy site.
   -- Active T+S and 2 PIVS
   -- Transfuse for goal >21.
   -- Trend hct
   .
   # H/O PE/SVC syndrome/port-related clots: Fondaparinux on hold due to
   dramatic decline in renal function and recent bleeding.  Can restart
   when hct and hemodynamics remain stable.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Chronic for patient, continue home diltiazem
   -- Monitor hemodynamics
   .
   # Wound: Ostomy consult. Continue topical therapies and local care.
   .
   # DM: Not on meds at home.
   -- Continue HISS
