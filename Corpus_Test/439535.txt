Chief Complaint:  Reason for Transfer: Hypoxia
   HPI:
   The patient was noted to be satting 85% on room air and using accessory
   muscles to breath.  He was started on a Nonrebreather by the team and
   did report some improvement in dyspnea and had an objective improvement
   in saturation.  EKG & CXR ordered with minimal change, ABG could not be
   obtained. The patient was started on a Heparin gtt for concern of PE
   despite guaiac positivity (no bolus) and was transferred to the ICU for
   further monitoring.
   VS on transfer 97.9 114 25 100% on NRB.
   Please see MICU [**Location (un) **] initial note for HPI. He was transfered to the
   floor from the ICU 12 hours prior after hypotension, ascites and
   pneumonia.  He was started on Vitamin K and continued on Vancomycin,
   Zosyn and Azithromycin.
   On arrival to the ICU, the patient is breathing rapidly but reports
   improved breathing with non-rebreather.  He denies fatigue, chest pain
   and reports that his abdominal pain is improved.
   We discussed the seriousness of his condition, the need for intubation
   and his brother was called to discuss the same information.

   Imaging: CXR [**10-25**]:
   The Port-A-Cath tip is in the mid SVC, unchanged. The cardiac
   silhouette is within normal limits. There is development of
   consolidation within the left lower lobe since the previous study. This
   is suspicious for pneumonia. There is also more faint densities within
   the right base. PEG tube is seen.
   .
   CTA: Initial read, no PE but multiple ground glass bilateral opacities.
   Microbiology: HCV, BCx Pending
   Urine: Probable enterococcus, speciation pending
   ECG: Sinus tachycardia with RBBB, change in morphology and difficult to
   interpret
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   58 yo male with esophageal CA in remission and hepatitis C returning to
   the ICU with new hypoxic respiratory failure that has developed in the
   last 12 hours.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Initially thought to be PE and patient
   was started on Heparin despite guaiac positivity.  CTA more consitent
   with ARDS from peritonitis or PNA or influenza versus Pulmonary edema
   from fluid shifts after paracentesis, aggressive resuscitation or
   decreased EF.
   - Intubate, initial ARDSnet ventilatory settings
   - Bronchoscopy to evaluate for hemorrhage, obtain BAL
   - D/C Heparin gtt
   - Broaden antibiotics to Vanc/Cipro/Cefepime (expanded GI and GNR
   coverage)
   - Q2 MDIs PRN
   - Obtain ABG/place Aline
   - Sedation with Fentanyl/Midazolam
   - BNP & Echo to evaluate for heart failure
   - EKG, Cardiac Enzymes
   - Repeat DFA
   # Hypotension with lactic acidosis: Patient's BP ranging from 80s to
   130s systolic, representing pain, and possible underlying sepsis with
   elevated lactate.  DDx: Sepsis vs. hypovolemia vs. cardiogenic shock.
   He does have likely d/t 3rd spacing in the setting of malnutrition,
   liver disease, and cancer.  Lactate elevated from hypoxia, high work of
   breathing and poor liver clearance.
   - Boluses of NS prn
   - Broaden ABx as above
   - Repeat Lactate
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, likely representing underlying
   sympathetic drive to breath and pain.
   - Treat underlying causes
   - Repeat EKG
   - Continue Mexilitine
   #: Anasarca/ Liver disease: Most likely d/t liver disease, although
   cannot r/o some cardiac involvement
   - Treat liver disease based on recs from hepatology
   #: Esophageal CA: thought to be definitively treated with cisplatin and
   5-FU.
   - Notify Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1895**] and the onc team about admission and f/u any recs
   they may have
   #FEN: replete electrolytes PRN, low salt diet
   #Prophy: pneumoboots, heparin TID, type and screen
   #Code status: Full Code
   #Communication: Patient; brother is health care proxy
   #Dispo: pending clinical stability
