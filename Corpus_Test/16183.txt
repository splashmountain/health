HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This 81 year old female with
known mitral valve prolapse for greater than 60 years and a
ten year history of dyspnea on exertion was admitted in
[**3050-10-6**] with congestive heart failure and pulmonary
edema.  She was followed by Cardiology, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **],
for her mitral regurgitation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Mitral regurgitation.
3.  Chronic bronchitis.
4.  Spinal stenosis.
5.  Kyphosis.
6.  Osteoporosis.
7.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
8.  Status post sinus surgery.
9.  Status post tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.

ALLERGIES:   She had no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF PREADMISSION TESTING:
1.  Fosamax 70 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Monopril 20 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Calcium.
5.  Centrum vitamins.
6.  Aspirin.

LABORATORY:  Catheterization data revealed a left ventricular
ejection fraction of 58% with a pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure of 16, an left ventricular end diastolic pressure of
17, four plus mitral regurgitation; one to two plus aortic
regurgitation and no coronary artery disease.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denied any cerebrovascular accident
or transient ischemic attack symptoms.  She had no history of
gastrointestinal bleed.  She did have exertional dyspnea and
palpitations.  No history of claudication, anemia or bleeding
problems.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On examination, her blood pressure
was 101/57; respiratory rate 12; room air saturation of 97%
with sinus bradycardia at 57.  She was alert and oriented and
neurologically grossly intact.  She had a Grade IV-V/VI
holosystolic murmur and her heart was regular rate and
rhythm.  Her breath sounds were clear bilaterally without any
wheezes, rhonchi or rales.  She had positive bowel sounds.
Her abdominal examination was benign with no masses
appreciated.  Her extremities were warm and well perfused
with two plus pulses throughout.  Her carotids had no bruits
bilaterally.

She was referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1882**] for mitral valve repair
versus replacement.

PREOPERATIVE LABS:  On [**3-3**] showed a white blood cell
count of 7.1, hematocrit 39, platelet count 161,000.  Sodium
143, potassium 4.6, chloride 102, carbon dioxide 31, BUN 19,
creatinine 1.0.  INR was 0.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**3-19**], she underwent a mitral
valve annuloplasty repair by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1882**] with a 26 millimeter
[**Doctor Last Name 1326**] band.  She also had inversion and suturing of her
left atrial appendage.  She was transferred to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit on a Propofol drip for
titration and Neo-Synephrine drip, in stable condition.

On postoperative day one, she had been extubated over that 24
hour period, was in sinus rhythm in the 70s with a blood
pressure of 96/32, central venous pressure 11, and cardiac
index of 2.7.  She had a saturation of 97% on three liters,
remained on a Neo-Synephrine drip at 1 mic per kilo per
minute, started her aspirin again, was taking morphine for
pain control.

Postoperative labs as follows:  White blood cell count of
13.3, hematocrit 29.3, platelet count 105,000.  Sodium 134,
potassium 4.6, chloride 106, carbon dioxide 24, BUN 13,
creatinine 0.6 with a blood sugar of 156.  She was
comfortable on examination.  Her lungs were clear.  Her heart
was regular in rate and rhythm.  The Neo-Synephrine continued
to be weaned and her diet was advanced as tolerated.  As soon
as her Neo was to be weaned, Lasix diuresis was begun and the
patient continued on her perioperative antibiotics.

Overnight on postoperative day one, the patient's urine
output dropped slightly.  Her pacing rate was decreased to
allow her to intrinsically pace herself at a faster rate.
Neo-Synephrine drip was started to increase her blood
pressure and urine output.  She was given some Hespan also on
postoperative day two as her neo-synephrine was back down to
0.5 with a blood pressure of 105/29 in sinus rhythm at 72.
She finished her antibiotics.  White count came down to 12.7.
Potassium was 4.4, BUN 14, creatinine 0.5.  She had decreased
lung sounds at the bases, but her heart was regular in
rhythm.  Her examination was otherwise benign with attempts
continuing to be made to wean her neo-synephrine and she
remained in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.

On postoperative day, she was transfused one unit of packed
red blood cells in the morning.  Her blood pressure responded
appropriately with the volume and the Neo-synephrine was
weaned to off.  The patient was out of bed and moving in the
Intensive Care Unit, and was transferred out of the Intensive
Care Unit to the floor on postoperative day two, alert and
oriented.

She was seen by Physical Therapy for evaluation and to
continue ambulation.  On postoperative day three, she had no
events overnight, had a good blood pressure, was
hemodynamically stable, saturating at 92% on room air, with
good urine output.  Her heart was regular rate and rhythm.
Her lungs were clear.  She had trace peripheral edema.  Her
chest tubes were pulled.  Her pacing wires were discontinued.
She continued working out of bed with Physical Therapy.  Her
incisions were clean, dry and intact and she was using
incentive spirometry for pulmonary toilet.

She continued to ambulate and increased to a level four.  She
did have a couple of premature ventricular contractions but
remained stable with no additional ectopy.  On the day of
discharge, postoperative day four, her lungs were clear.  She
had no edema.  Her heart was regular rate and rhythm with a
blood pressure of 120/64; sinus rhythm at 76.  She continued
to ambulate to a level five and was discharged from the
hospital on postoperative day four in stable condition.
