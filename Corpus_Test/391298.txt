Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - blood cultures speciated - MSSA. D'c ed Vanco and started naficillin
   - had diuresed >3.5L at 1500 with MAP's in high 50-60's and was unable
   to wean off levophed. held lasix gtt and gave 250cc IVF. Gave another
   250cc IVF at [**3301**], 500cc @ 2300 (since 1500-2359 he received nearly 3L)
   - had trouble weaning levophed, likely [**2-10**] intravascular volume
   depletion from overdiuresis
   - liver recs - likely shock liver, rec: abdominal U/S with dopplers,
   trend LFT's and supportive care
   - PA pressures were near systemic pressures, slightly increasing

   Assessment and Plan
   64 M w/ nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS,
   rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH with DOE,
   transferred for further evaluation of AS, now with GPC bacteremia and
   septic shock.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock - Still with significant pressor requirement. Now
   appears to be volume overloaded based on clinical exam, rising
   pulmonary pressures with PAD of 34 this am.
   - wean levophed as tolerated to maintain MAP>60 after diuresis
   - start lasix gtt to UOP>100-150cc/hr
   - continue Dobutamine at current rate to support cardiac output
   - patient is difficult to [**Last Name (LF) 5725**], [**First Name3 (LF) 114**] monitor PAD as proxy for PCWP
   .
   # MSSA bacteremia - Remains afebrile with decreasing white count.
   - maintain Hct>30%
   - continue nafcillin to complete a 2 week course (day #1=[**5-13**])
   - f/u serial blood Cx (pending)
   .
   # Liver failure - LFT
s still stable now, ALT down 1793
1434 and Tbili
   2.4
3.1; shock liver by liver team; U/S neg for cholangitis or
   cholecystitis. Synthetic function now stable (INR stable at 1.8
1.7)
   - liver consult appreciated
   - trend LFT's
   - avoid hepatotoxic medications
   - tylenol 2gm max
   .
   # AS - [**Location (un) **] 0.8 cm2 in cath lab; surgical repair candidate given
   symptoms of CHF however will need to clear infection prior to
   consideration for surgery
   - CT [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   # Acute on chronic systolic heart failure
 Appears to be volume
   overloaded on exam today
   - diuresis today as above
   .
   # Dyspnea
 Chronic symptoms is multifactorial [**2-10**] COPD, CHF, pulmonary
   hypertension
   - continue suppl. O2 to maintain O2 sats>93%
   - continue albuterol nebs
   .
   # ARF
[**2-10**] ATN in the setting of shock, contrast nephropathy.
   Non-oliguric and creatinine is improving with good urine output
   - diuresis with lasix gtt as above
   - trend Cr
   .
   # Anemia
 Hct stable over several days; unclear baseline; recent GIB
   w/ C-scope showing colonic AVM that was cauterized
   -daily hct
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets continue to trend down slowly, at 105K
   most likely [**2-10**] infection and liver failure. Overall, had had a
   decrease from 276
 105K over last 10 days. Low probability for HIT
   - continue to monitor.
   - d/w heme-onc re:possibility of HIT
   .
   # Afib - atrial fibrillation with rate-related aberrancy. Heart rate
   stable in 90-100
s. INR trending down and is currently sub-therapeutic.
   Had recent Gi bleed but [**2-10**] colonic AVM which was cauterized therefore
   at low risk to re-bleed
   - restart BB when hemodynamically stable
   - start heparin gtt for now, hold coumadin until medically stable
   - trend INR
   .
   # Back pain
 Likely [**2-10**] chronic lumbar back disease.
   -low dose narcotics to manage pain, limit tylenol use
   -OOB to chair
   -monitor clinical symptoms and exam for now
   -consider imaging of back if pain worsens
