   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with severe NYHA class IV systolic CHF with EF of 20%,
   secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy, admitted [**2984-8-31**] for acute
   exacerbation of CHF and transferred to CCU from [**Hospital1 2208**] service for
   aggressive diuresis and possible RRT for acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   .
   # PUMP: Severe systolic CHF, LVEF 20%, akinetic anterior,septal,and
   apical segments in LV, severe TR. Elevated right- and left- sided
   pressures (mean RA pressure and mean PCWP both 30 mmHg).
   - Will likely d/c CVVH today
   - Restart Lasix gtt and metolazone 5 mg [**Hospital1 **] when finished with CVVH
   - Continue milrinone gtt to augment systolic function
   - Keep maintaining MAP > 50 with phenylephrine if necessary
   - Will not intiate ACE-I secondary to renal failure
   - Monitor I/O, daily weights
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD s/p MI in [**2958**], CABG x 2. Cardiac cath showed
   right-dominant system w/ 50% mid-RCA stenosis, patent SVG-D1 and
   SVG-OM3 grafts. Known occluded native LCx and LAD. No PCI undertaken.
   - Continue ASA 81 mg
   - Continue Atorvastatin 20 mg
   - Consider metoprolol tartrate 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] instead of Toprol XL 50 mg
   daily
   .
   # RHYTHM: BiV-ICD recently interrogated [**2984-8-31**]. Per EP, not candidate
   for LV pacing. Had NSVT on [**8-27**], 7 a.m., rate 150 bpm. ICD is
   programmed to fire for VT>140 bpm and VF>190bpm. DDI pacer with rate >
   90 bpm, AV delay 160 msec.
   - Keep on cardiac monitor
   - Continue home amiodarone 200 mg daily
   .
   #h/o HIT
 swan-ganz cath had 500 cc heparin delivered in first 30
   minutes.
   -          Platelets today stable (210). Will continue to follow daily
   -          No need for Argatroban per heme/onc
   -          LUE U/S negative for any clot
   .
   # s/p MVR: Bioprosthetic mitral valve appears to be functioning well on
   TTE.
   - Was on warfarin x 2 yrs before d/c'ed by cardiologist, ? need for
   long-term anticoagulation upon discharge -> pt declined in past per Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) **]
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr increasing from baseline 2.5 to
   4.2. Etiology likely poor renal perfusion given severe systolic CHF and
   FeNa<1%
   - CVVHDF today, goal 100 cc/hr
   - Currently oliguric, continue to monitor UOP
   - Replete K PRN (K today is 5.0)
   - Does not need PhosLo at this point
   # URI: Cough and sore throat
   - conntinue guaifenisin and lozenges for symptom relief
   - consider repeat CXR this AM
   .
   # DM: IDDM with recent HA1c in [**2984-7-30**] of 9.2%
   - Continue home insulin regimen
   - SSI for meal coverage
   .
   # Hypothyroidism
   - Continue home levothyroxine
   .
   # OSA
   - Continue CPAP at night
   .
   FEN:
   - Will replete potassium as needed (initial hyperkalemia was treated
   with kayexelate)
   - Fluid restriction of 1200 mL/day
   - Low-sodium (<2g/day), cardiac-prudent, diabetic diet
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's, PICC, RIJ tunneled catheter
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SCD's
   -Pain management with Percocet q6h prn, PRN morphine for breakthrough
   -Bowel regimen with senna, docusate
