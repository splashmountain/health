   CT abdomen with IV contrast [**2522-4-8**], prelim read:
   PFI: Collection of fluid with a few foci of gas situated between the
   duodenum
   and the pancreatic head. The collection is intimately associated with
   the
   duodenum as well as the pancreatic head and uncinate process.
   Diverticulum
   off the second portion of the duodenum is again noted, and is within
   the fluid
   collection.
   CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with PO contrast only, [**2522-4-8**], final read:
   1. Approximately 7.8 cm low-attenuation lesion in the region of the
   second
   and third portion of the duodenum, adjacent to the uncinate process of
   pancreas with multiple pockets of gas. This finding is most consistent
   with
   abscess, possibly from perforated duodenal ulcer or duodenal
   diveritulitis,
   although underlying neoplasm cannot be excluded. Additionally, it is
   difficult
   to assess how much of this lesion represents abscess, underlying
   hematoma, or
   component of known duodenal diverticulum. Further evaluation with
   contrast-
   enhanced study is recommended.
   2. Moderate amount of ascites identified, tracking into the pelvis.
   3. Findings consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.
   4. Coronary calcifications are identified.
   5. Exophytic lesion arising from the right kidney and hyperintense
   lesion in
   the left kidney, possibly representing cysts, although these are
   incompletely
   evaluated on this study. Further evaluation with dedicated ultrasound
   is
   recommended when patient is stable.
   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH with c diff
   colitis on PO vanc and IV flagyl; on meropenem for HAP
   Leukocytosis/fever
 afebrile overnight. No new microbiology data.
   Lactate [**Month/Day/Year 1833**].
   - On meropenem Day   HAP as above with 8-day course of ABX (Ceftriaxone
   -> meropenem). Day 8 today. Will ask ID about discontinuing.
   - HD line replaced (was accidentally d/c
d while moving patient);
   beneficial if the line was source of fever
   - on PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff
   - CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis to look for occult foci of infection
   per ID recs
   - consider thoracentesis to evaluate pleural effusion for empyema
   - ID c/s for persistent fever
   - F/u beta-glucan, galactomannin for persistent yeast in urine
   .
   Septic Shock/Hypotension:   Initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA and C. diff are likely source.  Lactate [**Last Name (LF) 1833**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be indicative
   of decreased end organ perfusion. On Levophed to maintain BP
   - Would add vasopressin if lactate increases further or levophed
   requirement increases >0.15mcg/kg/min
   - on CVVH; run it even while needing pressors
   - Continue midodrine 10mg TID for pressure support in attempt to wean
   Levophed
   .
   VAP PNA/ Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA.. Patient trached on
   [**3-25**]. On Vent, Assist Control
   - intermittent trach mask trials as tolerated, supplemented by PSV PRN
 able to tolerate a few hours before tiring
   - treat new HAP as above with 8-day course of ABX (Ceftriaxone ->
   meropenem), follow up cultures
   - F/u mixed venous gas
   .
   Anemia
 severe anemia, patient is DAT (super Coombs positive), has
   many antibodies and will hemolyze donor blood. Should only transfuse in
   emergency settings of active ischemia. Patient has anemia of chronic
   disease, limited benefit from iron supp, but little harm to give it.
   Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of hemolysis bc low hapto high LDH.
   Appropriate reticulocytosis.
   - f/u heme recs
   - F/u hemolysis labs
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po
   .
   Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2522-3-31**]. Got PMV on [**3-30**].
   .
   Coagulopathy: improving, Appears to be have been caused by shock liver.
   Platelets stable, no evidence of DIC. Given vitamin [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8025**] [**3-28**].
   Continues to improve with slowly decreasing INR.
   - following daily
   - continue checking stool guaiac
   Transaminitis: Likely due to shock liver in setting of distributive
   picture with decreased EF. RUQ u/s shows known CBD dialation, s/p
   chole. LFT
s improving.
   .
   Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in ARF
   from acute tubular necrosis in setting of hypotension.  Pt on CVVH at
   this time
   - Renal following
   - Continue EPO
   .
   Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3, clear mentation. Frustrated with
   long ICU stay and illness. [**Month (only) 56**] also be delirious at moments.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use  Zyprexa PRN for agitation.
   .
   CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes. .
   CAD: CABG [**2501**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2515**]. Not on Warfarin.
   -          Maintain on telemetry
   -          Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing,
   see above.
   -          Continue midodrine
   .
   Hypoalbuminemia: decreased in the setting of sepsis
   -          Pt with high residuals but producing adequate stool, will
   continue erythromycin for bowel motility
