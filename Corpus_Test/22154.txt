CT abd:
1. New bowel wall thickening consistent with colitis involving
the ascending and transverse colon. Probable patchy areas of
thickening within the sigmoid and descending colon also. This
may be secondary to a low flow ischemia. If the sigmoid and
descending colon are also affected, this may be secondary to
infection. No obstruction, pneumatosis or abscess is identified.
2. New cavitary lesion in the right lower lobe with surrounding
patchy opacities. This is in the location of a previously seen
consolidation which has mostly resolved.
3. Liver transplant and common bile duct stents are
unremarkable. No free air or intrahepatic biliary dilatation
identified.
4. Diffuse soft tissue stranding within the mesentery and
subcutaneous soft tissues consistent with anasarca. Small
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 36391**] was admitted on [**3260-6-23**] for fever, headache, n/v,
and subjective left UE/LE numbness and weakness for one day.
Given her recent biliary stent placement the day before,
elevated WBC with 85% N and 7 bands, and her high-grade fever of
104, she was started on empiric Ceftriaxone, Flagyl, and
Vancomycin, while her studies were pending. CT of the head was
negative for increased ICP, and diagnostic LP performed was
negative for any meningitis. U/S of the abdomen was negative for
any biliary perforation. Her abdominal CT showed new bowel wall
thickening consistent with colitis involving the ascending and
transverse colon, with probable patchy areas of thickening
within the sigmoid and descending colon also. She was initially
stable when transferred to the floor, but was febrile to 101 and
tachycardic. The next morning, [**3260-6-24**], her SBO dropped to the
60's and her blood cultures returned at 4/4 bottles + for GNRs.
She was transferred to the ICU for further management for E.coli
sepsis/bacteremia and pressures.

While in the MICU -

1) Sepsis - Her initial blood cultures were 4/4 bottles positive
for gram negative rods.  Given her history of ESBL in the past,
she was covered with Imipenim and gentamicin.  On hospital day
2, the bacteria was identified as ESBL e.coli that was sensitive
to meropenem.  She was started on a 14 day course of meropenem.
 Surveillance cultures have been negative.  She became
hypotensive requiring fluid boluses and pressors.  By hospital
day 3, the pressors were weaned and she no longer required fluid
boluses.  Since she has been on chronic prednisone, she was
treated with stress dose steroids fludrocortisone and
hydrocortisone.  Once her pressure was stable on hospital day 3,
she was transitioned from hydrocortisone to a prednisone taper.
The fludrocortisone was stopped on hospital day 4.

2) CHF - Initally she required fluid boluses to maintain her
pressure.  She was gently hydrated and monitored closely to
prevent pulmonary edema.  An ECHO on hospital day 3 showed an EF
of 50-55%, which was increased from 10-20% a few months prior.
The etiology of the increase in EF is unclear.  Once her
pressure was stable, she was restarted on a low dose carvedilol.

3) S/P OLT - She was maintained on her immunosuppression regimen
througout the admission.

4) Thrombocytopenia- This was likely secondary to the acute
infection.  There was no evidence of TTP.

5) Swelling at IJ site - She had some swelling and discomfort at
the site of her IJ catheter.  There was no erythema or evidence
of infection.  An ultrasound was negative for a fluid collection
or hematoma.  The swelling and discomfort decreased once the
line was removed.

6) Hypothyroidism - Her synthroid was continued throughout the
admission.

7) History of atrial fibrillation - Her coumadin was held given
her low hematocrit.  She was maintained on digoxin.

8) DM - Shw was initially on an insulin drip given poor glycemic
control most likely [**12-24**] increased steroids.  She was
transitioned to an insulin sliding scale prior to being called
out from the ICU.

9) FEN - She was initially on clears and was advanced to a full
diabetic diet prior to leaving the ICU.  Her electrolytes were
repleted.

10) Prophylaxis - She was maintained on subcutaneous heparin and
a PPI.

11) Pain control - She was maintained on Morphine for pain
control.  Her requirement morphine decreased thoughout her ICU
stay.

After she was stabilized, she was transferred back to the floor
for further management of her bacteremia on [**3260-6-27**].

1) Sepsis - she was continued on Meropenem, to finish a 14-day
course. She had a PICC placed to go home with to finish her
regimen on [**3260-7-7**]. She was weaned off the stress-dose steroids
back to her maintainence dose of 10 mg Prednisone daily.

2) CHF - Recent echo showed EF 50%, increased from 10-20% on
prior echo. After discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the patient's
cardiologist, she was continued on all her prior cardiac meds
and will have outpatient follow-up to reassess her CHF status in
lieu of the recent echo with EF 50%.

3)h/o Asymptomatic bradycardia while in house - overnight, down
to 38-40 with pacer kicking in for a few beats, patient
asymptomatic. Discussed with EP attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who
put the pacer in, and decided that as patient was stable, she
should have outpatient follow-up to have device tested. She is
to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (referral from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] re: pacer check this
month.

4) S/P OLT - On Sirolimus, Cellcept, and Prednisone
-sirolimus level pending upon discharge
-to follow with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 90**] this month

5) Hypothyroidism - On synthroid.

6) History of atrial fibrillation - on coumadin 2 mg, INR
subtherapeutic currently at 0.9 as coumadin was held for several
days. Pt was in sinus rhythym while in the hospital.

7) L arm/leg tingling and pain - neuro followed, concern for
thalamic stroke given symptoms in left arm and leg vs. cervical
disk disease; their recs were to continue pt on coumadin with
follow-up in stroke clinic

8) DM - Her blood sugars were normalized after tapering the
steroids and were managed well on Lantus 14 U at bedtime and
coverage with Humalog SS, with which she was discharged with.

9) Dispo - she was stable after receiving her PICC on [**3260-6-29**] to
be discharged on [**3260-6-30**] with follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 90**], Dr. [**Name8 (MD) 36392**] NP, [**Name8 (MD) **]. [**Name5 (PTitle) **]/[**Doctor Last Name 1283**], and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 36393**].
