History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 44 yo F with h/o asthma who presented to [**Hospital1 **] ER with dyspnea, found to have possible pneumonia and
asthma exacerbation, was intubated and found to have NSTEMI.  Pt
is currently intubated and sedated.  Per her family, her niece
visited her on [**8-18**] and found the patient feeling unwell and
short of breath.  Her niece had called 911 and the patient was
taken to [**Hospital3 **] ER.  VS were: 124/71, pulse 107, RR
30, O2 sat 84% on RA.  On exam, she was noted to be diaphoretic
and have expiratory wheezing.  CXR revealed bilateral airspace
opacities, bilateral infiltrates v. pulmonary edema, which were
noted to be rapidly increasing overal serial CXRs.  Pt was
started on Bipap and admitted to the ICU.  She failed Bipap and
was then intubated.  Pt was treated with ceftriaxone,
azithromycin, and solumedrol.  Tmax was 100.4.  Sputum gram
stain showed few polys, few GPCs in pairs, rare GPCs in
clusters; sputum cx grew scant normal respiratory flora.
Further workup revealed increasing cardiac enzymes, CK of
153->1143, CKMB of 11->150, Troponin T of 0.06->2.03
(0.01-0.04).  BNP was 1753.  Preliminary ECHO work-up showed EF
of 30-35%, severe inferior wall hypokinesis, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] report,
EKG showed SR at rate of 100, with Q waves in lead III and AVF
and non-specific ST-T wave changes.  She was treated with IV
Lasix, nitro gtt, heparin gtt, and plavix and transferred here.

.
In the cardiac cath lab, she was found to have 100% stenosis of
distal RCA, which was stented with 2 BMS.  Resting hemodynamics
revealed elevated right and left ventricular filling pressures
with RVEDP of 27 mmHg and PCW of 25 mmHg.
.
Per family, ROS was positive intermittent substernal chest pain
for the past 2 years.  Per sister, she had normal stress tests,
perhaps a year ago.  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had presented with pedal edema
and weight gain 3 months ago.  She also has a chronic productive
cough.  She had been hospitalized for pneumonia twice in the
last year and may have required intubation.  Last
hospitalization was in [**3225-3-25**].


Past Medical History:
Asthma
Obesity, s/p gastric bypass in [**3219**]
Depression
s/p cesarean sections x2


Social History:
Patient is divorced with 2 sons.  She is a nurse.  Social
history is significant for [**12-25**] ppd x 30 years.  There is history
of alcohol use, [**2-25**] drinks per day.  Family is unaware of any
withdrawal issues.


Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.

PERTINENT LABS/STUDIES:

.
EKG demonstrated NSR with q waves in III and AVF, TWI in II,
III, AVF, 1 mm STE in V1, STD in V3, V4.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**3225-8-19**] demonstrated:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral akinesis.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] EF 45%.
 Right ventricular chamber size is normal and free wall motion
is probably normal (views suboptimal). The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion.
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**3225-8-19**] demonstrated:
The LMCA, LAD, LCX showed no obstructive coronary artery
disease. The RCA showed a distal discrete 100% stenosis with
left to right collaterals.
.
CXR [**3225-8-19**]
AP single view of the chest is obtained with patient in supine
position. The patient is intubated, the ETT terminating in the
trachea some 3 cm above the level of the carina. An NG tube has
been placed and reaches far below the diaphragm. There is marked
cardiac enlargement configuration indicating a prominence of the
left ventricular contour as well as a beginning double contour
and widening of the tracheal bifurcation indicative of left
atrial enlargement. There is no pneumothorax. There are
bilateral mostly
centrally located parenchymal densities consistent with
pulmonary edema.
The lateral pleural sinuses are free. Possibility of some
bilateral pleural effusions layering in the posterior pleural
spaces in this patient in supine position can, however, not be
excluded.
.
MRA Head. [**3225-8-24**].
CONCLUSION: Findings remain suspicious for multiple infarcts,
shown to be
subacute in age.
.
Renal Biopsy.  [**3225-8-29**].
Comment:
1.  There is no evidence of an immune complex
glomerulonephritis.
2.  The focal vascular changes noted are insufficient for a
definite diagnosis of a thrombotic microangiopathy.  Clinical
correlation is indicated.
.
Skin biopsy:
Multiple thrombi within small vessels in dermis with overlying
ischemic epidermal changes consistent with thrombotic
microangiopathy.
No vasculitis is seen.

Echo [**10-16**]: The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior and
inferolateral walls. Transmitral Doppler imaging is consistent
with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets do not fully coapt.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**3225-10-1**],
the severity of tricuspid regurgitation has decreased. Severe
ischemic mitral regurgitation resulting from the mitral leaflets
failing to coapt is unchanged.

Echo [**10-18**]: The left and right atrium are markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akineis of the inferior and
inferolateral walls. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 40 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. At least moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
fat pad.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**3225-10-16**],
the findings are similar.

[**10-15**] Renal Ultrasound: FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 10.9
cm, and the left kidney measures 10.2 cm. No hydronephrosis is
identified in either kidney. The cortical thickness appears
normal bilaterally. No cysts or solid masses are identified.

IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Normal cortical thickness
bilaterally.

SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY.



DIAGNOSIS:

MILDLY HYPOCELLULAR ERYTHROID DOMINANT BONE MARROW WITH
DYSERYTHROPOIESIS AND DYSMEGAKARYOPOIESIS.



Note: The findings are not inconsistent with the effects of
gangcyclovir +/- viremia.  A primary myelodysplastic syndrome
appears less likely, but can not be entirely ruled out.  Special
stains for microorganisms (Acid-fast, GMS, PAS) are negative.
By immunohistochemistry, T-cell markers CD3 and CD5 highlight
lymphocytes singly and in clusters.  CD20 is immunoreactive in a
small subset.  CD138 highlights plasma cells in interstitial and
perivascular distribution, which by Kappa/Lambda light chain
immunostaining appear polytypic.





MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

Peripheral Blood Smear:

The smear is adequate for evaluation.  Erythrocytes show
significant anisopoikilocytosis with polychromatophils,
macrocytes, target cells, echinocytes, dacrocytes, microcytes,
ovalocytes and basophilic stippling.   A peripheral blood smear
was not submitted.  Numerous nucleated RBC's are seen, some with
irregular nuclear contours and asymmetric nuclear budding.   The
white blood cell count appears normal.  Neutrophils with toxic
vacuolization are prominent and include hypogranular forms.
Platelet count appears normal.  Large forms are seen.
Occasional Giant forms are present.  Differential count shows
91% neutrophils, 3% monocytes,  8% lymphocytes, 1% other
myelocyte.



Aspirate Smear:

The aspirate material is inadequate for evaluation due to lack
of spicules.



Clot Section and Biopsy Slides:

The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation and consists of
two pieces of fragmented core biopsy with partial aspiration
artifact measuring 0.6 cm in aggregate. The marrow is variably
cellular, overall 20-30%.  Interstitial debris and macrophages
appear prominent.

The M:E ratio estimate is decreased.  Erythroid precursors are
relatively increased in number and show occasional dysplastic
forms (asymmetric nuclear budding and irregular nuclear
contours).  Myeloid elements are decreased and show
full-spectrum maturation.

Megakaryocytes are present in normal number and are focally
present in clusters.

There is an interstitial infiltrate of plasma cells /
lymphoplasmacytic cells occurring singly and in small clusters
occupying 10% of marrow cellularity.   Marrow clot section is
similar to the biopsy.



Special Stains:

Iron stain is inadequate for evaluation due to lack of spicules.



Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Ms. [**Known patient lastname 15997**] is a 44 year old female admitted
initially to an OSH for multifocal pneumonia, found to have an
NSTEMI, s/p BMS to RCA on admission.  Hospital course further
complicated by multiorgan system failure.
.
NSTEMI.  Patient transferred to [**Hospital1 22**] due to NSTEMI.  Found to
have mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior/inferolateral akinesis on echo.  She had cardiac cath
and was found to have 100% stenosis of distal RCA, which was
stented x2 with BMS.  She was started on aspirin, atorvastatin,
and plavix. The patient remained hypotensive after cardiac
catheterization, and was found to have mitral regurgitation.
Her mitral regurgitation worsened thoughout her hospital course
and she developed cardiogenic shock dependent on dobutamine.
Her dobutamine was weaned off over several weeks, but she was
unable to tolerate hemodialysis while off dobutamine.
.
Respiratory failure.  Patient was initially admitted to [**Hospital1 **] after presenting with a multifocal pneumonia.  Upon
transfer to [**Hospital1 22**], patient had daily fevers in spite of broad
spectrum antibiotics and negative cultures.  Her CXR improved,
however, she had persistent altered mental status and tachypnea
thought be secondary to a central process preventing extubation.
 She was given steroids for a short period.  However, given her
persistent respiratory alkalosis and cheynes-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing,
she underwent tracheostomy.  Due to her distorted anatomy
secondary to gastric bypass, a PEG was not performed at the same
time.  During her hospital course, she had episodes of small
amounts of hemoptysis. The patient eventually progressed to
being weaned off the vent entirely, and was breathing
comfortably on the trach mask.
.
Altered mental status.  Following cardiac catheterization,
patient found to have several embolic strokes.  Patient had
serial TTEs and a TEE looking for a source, but was not found.
She remained minimally responsive and with cheynes-[**Doctor Last Name **]
breathing.  EEG x 2 showed toxic-metabolic patterns.  Patient
was ultimately started on dialysis in hopes that improvemento
her uremia might improve her mental status.  Over time, her
mental status improved, and she began to follow commands.
.
Renal Failure.  Patient developed renal failure during her
hospital course.  Etiology of her renal failure was not clear.
A renal biopsy could not rule out thrombotic microangiopathy,
but was felt to be consistent with ATN.  She was started on
dialysis.  There was concern for TTP given thrombocytopenia that
developed three weeks into her hospital stay, but the decision
was made against empiric plasmapharesis after consultation with
transfusion medicine.  Patient was given 2 units of
cryoprecipitate for increasing DIC picture, and also started on
heparin gtt without bolus for concern of TTP and increasing
ischemia in lower extremities. She was dialyzed with CVVH, then
hemodialysis.  The patient progressed with hemodialysis for
several weeks. During the week of [**10-15**] she became intolerant to
fluid shifts during hemodialysis and would become hypotensive
either during or shortly after hemodialysis.  She was reaching
the point where she was requiring fluid boluses after every
hemodialysis session. On [**10-17**], she was restarted on CVVH.
.
DIC/TMA.  Patient developed thrombocytopenia, elevated fibrin
split products, low fibrinogen, thought to be consistent with
DIC.  She had a biopsy of her skin consistent with thrombotic
microangiopathy. She had decreased perfusion to her feet as
well.  This was felt to be due to DIC in adition to levophed.
She was transfused cryoprecipitate and other blood products as
needed. Her coagulopathy was treated with IV heparin. Her
thrombocytopenia and coagulation abnormalities resolved,
however, the patient suffered ischemia of her distal extremities
with resulting necrosis.  The patient was left with stable dry
gangrene of her left foot up to her ankle, her toes of her right
foot, and several fingers on each hand. Vascular surgery was
consulted and they recomended pursuing ampuation of her feet
after the patient regained better functioning status after a
stay at rehab.
.
Fevers.  Patient initially presenting with daily fevers.  She
was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics but continued to
have daily fevers.  Given yeast in multiple sites (lung, urine),
 but never in blood, patient was started on caspofungin.  She
was also given steroids for bronchospasm.  In spite of broad
spectrum antiobiotics and steroids, she had daily fevers.  Her
fevers resolved after discontinuation of steroids and
antibiotics.  She subsequently developed a line infection
treated with seven days of vancomycin.  The patient develped
numerous other infections during her stay.  She developed
C.Difficile colitis and was treated with flagyl and oral
vancomycin.  She developed a CMV viremia and was treated with
ganciclovir.  She had an acitenobacter vent associated pneumonia
and completed a course of augmentin.  In addition, she developed
multiple other fevers which were attributed to line infetions,
treated with vancomycin.  Her central lines were changed by
interventional radiology on multiple occasions.
.
Rhabdo.  Patient developed rhabdo during her hospital stay.  CK
reached levels greater than 10,000.  This was thought to be due
to decreased mobility secondary to her altered mental status.
Her CK trended down to normal levels.
.
Pain Control: The patient experienced continuous pain from her
necrosed and gangrenous feet and fingers. She was treated with
IV fentanyl to treat her pain. The family raised concerns that
fentanyl administration was causing increased drowsiness of the
patient, and requested that it be curtailed. The patient's pain
was continuously evaluated by the nursing staff and physicians
and treated appropriately with fentanyl. The patient was
eventually transitioned to a fentanyl patch with the idea of
weaning off her IV fentanyl administration.  Despite the
fentanyl patch she was still requiring additional IV fentanyl.
.
Shock. The patient developed shock on [**8-23**] and remained in shock
for the majority of her hospitalization. Initially attributed to
septic etiology; she was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics
and placed on neosinephrine, vasopressin, and levophed.  Her
neosinephrine and vasopressin was discontinued and she
eventually remaned on levophed for blood pressure support. On
[**9-28**], TTE findings of 4+ MR, plus low central venous O2
saturations rasied the concern for a cardiogenic componenet.
Her levophed was discontinued and dobutamine was begun. Her
blood pressure, lactate levels, and central venous O2
saturations improved with initiation of dobutamine.  She
remained in cardiogenic shock, dependent on dobutamine until
[**10-15**].  Her dobutamine was weaned off and she was able to
maintain a mean arterial pressure over 60.  She continued with
periods of hypotension, most notable during or immediately after
hemodialysis, and required fluid suport during these periods.
After one such hypotensive episode [**10-17**] she was not responsive
to fluids and was restarted on levophed. her CVVH was restarted
on [**10-17**].

The afternoon of [**10-18**] @4pm her routine ABG showed a pH of 6.87,
a bicarbonate of 4, and a lactate of 12.9. These results came as
a surprise as an ABG at noon [**10-18**] showed a pH of 7.33, with a
bicarbonate of 16, and a lactate of 2.0. She remained otherwise
hemodynamically stable during this period without alterations in
her baseline blood pressure or heart rate.  Her CVVH fluid was
immediately changed to provide the maximum amount of
bicarbonate.    She slowly became hypotensive and was started on
vasopressin, in addition to levophed. She was bolused with a
total of 15 amps of sodium bicarbonate over the next 10 hours,
in addition to tromethamine which is a bicarbonate alternative.
ABGs showed her pH slowly improving to 7.1, with bicarbonate
levels improving to 9, however her lactate continued to rise to
a peak of 20.9.  The cause of her acte lactic acidois and
electrolyte abnormaities were unknown, but it was thought that
she may be in worsening cardiogenic shock from a new myocardial
infarction, cardiac tamponade, or massive pulmonary embolism,
she may have been in septic shock, or she have suffered an
insult to another organ system such as acute bowel ischemia.
Stat cardiac echo did not show cardiac tamponade, or new wall
motion abnormalities suggestive of pulmonary embolism or
myocardial infarction. Cardiac enzymes were trended and were
flat.  She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with
vancomycin and meropenem to cover for possible infection causing
shock, in addition to coverage for clostridial species with
flagyl, PO vancomycin, and clindamycin.  Physical examination
revealed a distended abdomen.  Liver enzymes showed elevated
transaminases consistent with ishemic liver, normal bilirubin
and alkaline phosphatase, normal lipase, but an elevated amylase
to 853.  The acuity of the patient's deterioration, in addition
to rising lactate, elevated amylase, and distended abdomen, led
us to believe that the patient was experiencing bowel ischemia.
this would not be surprising in a patient with an underlying
coagulopathy of uncertain etiology.  The family was spoken to at
9pm and told of her grave prognosis. The family was fixated on
the patient's fentanyl use, and believed that her depressed
mental status was due to fentanyl.  It was explained to her
family that her current condition was not secondary to fentanyl
administration, and that an acute unidentified event occured
which is causing the patient's deterioration. They were told
that this event was most likely mesenteric ischemia but that it
was uncertain, because the patient was too ill to be imaged.
At 4am the patient PEA arrested. CPR was initiated for 90
seconds.  She was given epinephrine and atropine, and begun on
neosinephrine and dopamine.  Her blood pressure increased and
her pulse returned.  Her sister [**Name (NI) **] was called and told of
the events.  She was told that the cause of her impaired cardiac
contractility was her underlying acidosis, and that nothing
medically could be done to stop the acidosis from worsening.
[**Doctor First Name 641**] requested the patient remain full code.  The patient
progressed to apnea and was placed on the ventilator.  She
underwent a second PEA arrest at 5am, progressing to torsades de
pointes.  She was defibrillated once with return to her
junctional rhythm.  She underwent another round of CPR lasting
90 seconds. She was given epinephrine, atropine, and sodium
bicarbonate and her blood pressure returned.  her sister [**Name (NI) 641**]
was notified once again after this second PEA arrest.  again,
she was told of her grave prognosis, and that her acidosis could
not be alleviated.  She again requested that the patient remain
full code.  She requested the patient remain full code so that
she could contact family members, and have them arrive to the
hospital so they could see the paitient while she was still
alive.  From the hours of 6am through 8:30am the patient was
given epinephrine, atropine, and sodium bicarbonate in order to
stabilize her blood pressure.  The patient's hematocrit dring
this time decreased from 18.0 to 9.0, possibly from
intrabdominal hemorrhage from perforated bowel as a result of
bowel ischemia. At 8:30 am the patient's extended family had
arrived.  After they had a chance to see the patient alive they
requested she be made DNR.  All resuscitative efforts ceased and
the patient passed away at 9am.

The following day the family requested an autopsy be performed.
