TITLE: CCU Progress Note
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient had TEE yesterday which demonstrated no acute thrombus.
   Patient then underwent cardioversion with 200 J of shock. Patient
   spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm for a few seconds and then went
   back into atrial fibrillation.  Discussed case with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2767**] last
   night, decided to start patient on amiodarone as well as coumadin.
   Discussed plan with daughter who was agreeable.
   .
   This AM patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, or
   abdominal pain. She states that she is feeling much better than
   yesterday.

   Assessment and Plan
   89F with PMH significant for HTN, hypothyroidism, diabetes without
   prior cardiac history who presents  with new AF, CHF.
   # RHYTHM:  Unknown if this AF is new, never documented before and pt
   markedly symptomatic.  Likely she was dependent on her atrial kick in
   setting of probable depressed cardiac function.  Ideally would like to
   consider CV for restoration of sinus rhythm. As duration of AF unknown
   will refrain from amio for rate control overnight to avoid accidental
   chemical CV. TSH on admission 0.95 which is WNL. For infectious wrk-up
   patient has had chest x-ray. Got Levaquin in the ED for ? of pneumonia.
   Patient without fever, elevation in white count or other localizing
   symptoms to suggest infection. Initially patient on diltiazem drip
   which was discontinued as was dropping pressures. Plan is for TEE today
   with possible cardioversion. Patient will need post-procedure coumadin
   initiation.  Patient currently in atrial fibrillation with rates
   controlled in 70-80s. Repeat UA without LE or nitrate.
   -Hep gtt for now, started coumadin last night, goal INR [**12-27**]
   - CIS
   .
   # PUMP:  On admission exam pt is volume overloaded with elevated JVP,
   crackles, some mild LE edema.  Based on imaging pt has significant
   cardiomegaly.  At risk for LVH/diastolic dysfunction in setting of HTN.
   Also has DM so at risk for silent ischemia/ischemic cardiomyopathy.
   Echo on admission demonstrates mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with preserved global and regional systolic function. Right
   ventricular hypertrophy with preserved systolic function. Moderate
   tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   -Strict I/Os, goal is -500 cc per day to even, would give lasix to meet
   this goal
   - f/u TEE
   - restart ACE inhibitor today at previous outpatient dose
   .
   # CORONARIES:  No known history of CAD. ECG without acute ischemic
   changes. Rechecked admission lipid panel which demonstrated HDL 63, LDL
   74, triglycerides 100.
   - cont outpatient ASA
   - started a statin on this admission given CAD equivalent despite LDL
   being near goal
   - check LFTs
   -f/u repeat EKGs
   .
   # Hyperkalemia
 now resolved: Unclear etiology, Cr mildly elevated
   from baseline, but not high enough to explain hyperkalemia. On ACEI, no
   other culprit meds.
   -tx hyperkalemia agressively in setting of potential CV.
   - restart ACEi as potassium3.7 this morning
   .
   # DM2.  Not insulin dependent at home. Holding oral agents in house s/p
   contrast load.  Was hyperglycemic in ED in setting of receiving D5 in
   bicarbonate.
   -FSBS
   -ISS
   -diabetic diet
   .
   # Hypertension
 patient hypertensive on admission currently with
   stable BP after discontinuating of diltiazem drip. Patient as
   outpatient maintained on Lisinopril.
   - restarted lisinopril today as hypertensive
   .
   # Acute vs. chronic renal failure
 patient with creatinine of 1.3 on
   admission with previous value of 1.0 in [**2572**]. Unclear if this
   represents new baseline.  Cr improving, now 1.1 today. UA without
   obvious source of infection.
   -          trend Cr
   -          avoid nephrotoxins
   -          renally dose medcations
   -          f/u urine culture
   .
   #Hypothyroidism
 TSH on admission 0.95 which is WNL.
   -continue current outpatient dose.
   .
   # Anemia: baseline Hct appears to be low 30s.  Currently 27.  Anemia
   labs sent during this admission with iron 41, tibc 302, b12 508,
   ferritin 98, transferring 232
   - active type and screen
   - guaiac stools
   - transfuse for hcT< 21 or 25 if evidence of active end organ ischemia
   .
   FEN: cardiac diabetic diet. No IVF as volume overloaded.
   ACCESS: PIV's x 2
   PROPHYLAXIS:  On heparin gtt, colace, senna, coumadin
