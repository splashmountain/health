Chief Complaint:  Unresponsive
   HPI:
   60 yo male, h/o 5V CABG, CHF, BIV ICD/PPM, who found by his wife,
   sitting in chair with heated blanket, looking pale and with difficulty
   speaking.  He then appeared not to be breathing.  She called EMS, CPR
   briefly initiated(1-2 min) No tonic-clonic movements, but +
   incontinence of urine.  EMS reported a weak pulse, but could not get a
   good BP.  Got small amount fluid in the field and then improved.
   In the ED, initial vital: T 100 rectal, HR 95, BP 113/83, RR 13, 100%
   NRB.  He was noted to be confused with poor short term memory.  CT head
   negative for acute process.  Labs notable for WBC of 15K, no left
   shift, TropT 0.04, INR 1.5.  Digoxin 1.8, Lactate 1.8. ECG V-paced.
   Urine and serum tox screens negative, U/A negative.  Got 2L NS, 1gm CTX
   and 1 gm vancomycin emperically.  Had swelling of LLE> [**Last Name (LF) 1023**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] CTA
   performed which was negative.  Later, family reported that this is his
   baseline.  He was seen by neuro who found he had inability to form new
   short term memories, consistent with b/l hippocampi injury, possibly
   from anoxic injury.  It was felt that the situation was more consistent
   with a cardiac event, and he was admitted to the ICU for monitoring and
   work up.  Vitals upon transfer: T 98.8, HR 83, BP 104/90, RR 17, 100%
   2L.

   [**2904-2-15**] CXR:
   The patient is status post sternotomy. The heart is enlarged. There is
   a small left pleural effusion. The right lung is relatively clear.
   There is a residual lead from a left- sided pacemaker with the tip
   projected in the right atrium. There is an intact right-sided pacemaker
   with two leads projected in the right atrium and right ventricle
   respectively. CONCLUSION: Cardiomegaly; small left pleural effusion

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y.o. man found unresponsive at home.
   # Unresponsive.  Unclear etiology, has improved.  No PE or pneumothorax
   on CTA.  Could be consistent with cardiac arrhythmia or arrest,
   possibly with a shock delivered by his ICD.  MI possible, although
   unlikely to have improved so quickly.  Also on differential include
   seizure given bladder incontinence, other neurologic event such as
   TIA/CVA.  History not very consistent with sepsis or infectious
   etiology, despite low grade temp, and leukeocytosis (no left shift),
   and would be unlikely to improve so quickly.
   - EP consult in AM; interrogate ICD/pacer
   - If no etiology found by interrogation; obtain echo
   - f/u neuro recommendations, no need for anti-epileptics currently; c/s
   EEG if other w/u  negative
   - c/s MRI brain if no cardiac etiology revealed
   - culture blood, urine
   - vanco for ? cellulitis (see below)
   - serial cardiac enzymes
   - cardiac monitoring
   # CAD s/p CABG
   - r/o MI as above
   - statin
   - hold bblocker, given relative hypotension
   # CHF, last EF 25%.  Currently Euvolemic appearing
   - continue digoxin; start in AM
   - hold sotalol, lasix, spironolactone overnight as borderline low BP
   # LLE wound, ? cellulitis.  Area is red, warm, and has open wound.
   Afebrile although had rectal temp of 100 upon arrival to ED.
   - Vancomycin 1gm Q12
   - wound care consult
   - podiatry consult in AM
   - monitor clinically
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   # Hyperlipidemia: continue statin
   # Sedatives: hold lorazepam/clonazepam/ambien given borderline low BP
   # Elevated INR: Vit K 5mg PO x1
   # FEN: 2gm sodium diet
   # Pophylaxis: SC heparin, H2blocker
   # Access: two peripheral IVs
