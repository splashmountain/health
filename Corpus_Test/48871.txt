Pertinent Results:

Conclusions
PRE-CPB:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The pt is in atrial
fibrillation. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The LV
chamber is severely dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30%) with the inferior
wall appearing more hypokinetic than other wall segments. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is severely dilated. While the entire visualized
ascending aorta appears dilated, there appears to be a focal
outpouching at the level just below the RPA. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic
dissection is seen.
A bileaflet mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present. There
appear to be three small paravalvular leaks, two in the area
near the interatrial septum, and one next to the area by the
pulmonary valve. The prosthetic valve appears to be well-seated
with normal leaflet motion.
A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present. The normal
washing jets of this mechanical prosthesis is seen. The valve
appears to be well-seated. Occasionally, one leaflet is slower
than the other to close, possibly due to poor LV contractility.
POST-CPB:
The patient is now on Epi, Phenylephrine, and Milrinone
infusions. The LV EF appears improved on inotropic support,
estimated EF is 40-50%. The inferior wall still appears to be
more hypokinetic than other wall segments.
The bioprothetic valves continue to show appropriate function.
The aortic valve paravalvular leaks remain unchanged from
pre-op. The peak gradient across the aortic valve is 20mmHg, and
the mean gradient is 9mmHg with a CO of 7.
There is no evidence of aortic dissection.

Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2614-5-31**] 7:24 PM

Final Report: PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were
reviewed in comparison to [**2614-5-29**] and several prior studies
dating back to [**2612**].
The cardiomegaly is unchanged, including both left and right
ventricle. Two replaced valves are noted, unchanged since the
prior examination. The small amount of right pleural effusion is
unchanged. Anterior mediastinal air with small air-fluid level
noted on the lateral view are redemonstrated with the air-fluid
level potentially representing small loculated anterior
pneumothorax in combination with post-surgery air in the
mediastinum. Small amount of pneumopericardium cannot be
excluded laterally, although it might represent summation of
shadows. Continued followup is recommended.
Post-sternotomy wires appear intact.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was a direct admission to the operating room on
[**2614-5-26**] where the patient underwent replacement of ascending
aorta and aortic hemiarch. Please see the operative report for
details. In summary he had:
Redo sternotomy, replacement of ascending aorta and hemiarch
using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest with a 30-mm Vascutek
Dacron tube graft, catalog number [**Serial Number 8393**], lot number [**Serial Number 8394**],
serial number [**Serial Number 8395**]. His CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS TIME was  119
minutes, with a CROSSCLAMP TIME of 75 minutes, and CIRCULATORY
ARREST TIME of  18 minutes.
He tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  Heparin was initiated as a bridge to coumadin for
his mechanical valves.  The patient was evaluated by the
physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD #7 the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged on to home
with VNA services, in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions advised.
