   Initial visit, Cardiology service: CCU
   Presenting complaint: Chest pain, (Other: Aspirin desentization)
   History of present illness: Mr. [**Known patient lastname 3368**] is a 68 yo M with history of
   asthma, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and AS who has had 3-4 days of
   crescendo angina.  The patient reports that starting on Friday
   afternoon he began to have substernal crushing chest pain/tightness.
   This pain was persistent and improved with rest, but persisted for the
   duration of the day.  He did not have shortness of breath, dizziness or
   lightheadedness with this episode.  The pain recurred several more
   times over the weekend, usually resolving with rest.  The pains
   required him to stop the participitating activities (working, dancing,
   snowshoveling).  After chest tightness on Monday, the patient called
   his PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] recommended going to the ER if the pain persisted, but if
   not, then the patient was to come to the PCP's office in AM.  The
   patient reported to the PCP's office on tuesday AM.  He was found to
   have ST depressions and mild troponin elevation.  Thus the patient was
   sent directly to the ED (instead of the scheduled stress test).  The
   patient was given plavix 600 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, metoprolol 2.5 mg
   x2 IV and started on heparin gtt with bolus.  The patient was then
   transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for aspirin desentization.
   .
   On arrival the patient has no chest pain or dyspnea. He reports no
   current symptoms including no chest pain, no shortness of breath, no
   dizziness. He is hungry.
   .
   On review of systems, he has intermittent cough and occasional dyspnea
   on exertion x last 5 months.  Also patient has been having exertional
   left leg pain over the last few months.  He denies any prior history of
   stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at
   the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains,  hemoptysis, black stools
   or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.  All of the
   other review of systems were negative.
   .
   Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of  paroxysmal
   nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
   presyncope.

   Assessment and Plan
 CHEST PAIN
 Aspirin Allergy
   68 yo M with unstable angina no CP free for >12 hours who presents as
   transfer for aspirin desentization prior to cardiac catherization.
   1. Acute Coronary Syndrome: the patient presented with chest pain
   consistent with unstable angina, mild troponin elevation and ECG
   changes make NSTEMI more likely.   Given ST changes and mild troponin
   elevation, the likely cause of the chest pain is CAD, though other
   causes including GERD are possible but less likely.
   - heparin gtt
   - plavix load at OSH, continue plavix 75 mg daily
   - aspirin desensitization
   - atorvastatin 80 mg
   - serial ECGs
   - NPO for cardiac cath in AM
   2. Aortic stenosis/sclerosis: mild to moderate by history (unclear if
   true stenosis or sclerosis), asymptomatic.  Will get echo and confirm.
   - echo
   3. Aspirin desentization: patient with asthma reaction to aspirin.
   Will do aspirin desentization per [**Hospital1 1**] protocol with total dose approx
   317 mg today.  Will give 325 mg in AM if tolerates desentization.  Will
   also pretreat with singulair and prednisone per Allergy
   recommendations.
   - Aspirin desentization
   - CCU for observation
   - Pretreatment with singulair and prednisone, epi/benadryl prn at
   bedside
   #  Hypertension: Will treat with low dose nitro gtt for now.  But will
   restart metoprolol once 3 hours post last aspirin dose.
   #  Hyperlipidemia: Lipids well controlled on labs at OSH.  Will give
   high dose atorvastatin while pre cath.
   FEN:  NPO after midnight, lytes prn, IVF prior to cath
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin gtt
   -Bowel regimen
