   Assessment and Plan
   64 M w/ nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS,
   rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH with DOE,
   transferred for further evaluation of AS, now with GPC bacteremia and
   septic shock.

   # Cardiogenic shock
 levophed DC
ed this AM, will see if still has
   significant pressure requirement. Now appears to be volume overloaded
   based on clinical exam, rising pulmonary pressures with PAD of 34 this
   am.
   - wean levophed as tolerated to maintain MAP>60 after diuresis
   - start lasix gtt to UOP>100-150cc/hr
   - continue Dobutamine at current rate to support cardiac output
   - patient is difficult to [**Last Name (LF) 5725**], [**First Name3 (LF) 114**] monitor PAD as proxy for PCWP
   .
   # MSSA bacteremia - Remains afebrile with white count is stable.
   - maintain Hct>30%
   - continue nafcillin to complete a 2 week course (day #1=[**5-13**])
   - f/u serial blood Cx (pending)
   .
   # Liver failure - LFT
s are trending down; shock liver by liver team;
   U/S neg for cholangitis or cholecystitis. Synthetic function now stable
   (INR stable)
   - liver consult appreciated
   - trend LFT's
   - avoid hepatotoxic medications
   - tylenol 2gm max
   .
   # AS - [**Location (un) **] 0.8 cm2 in cath lab; surgical repair candidate given
   symptoms of CHF however will need to clear infection prior to
   consideration for surgery
   - CT [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   # Acute on chronic systolic heart failure
 Appears to be volume
   overloaded on exam today
   - diuresis today as above
   .
   # Dyspnea
 Chronic symptoms is multifactorial [**2-10**] COPD, CHF, pulmonary
   hypertension
   - continue suppl. O2 to maintain O2 sats>93%
   - continue albuterol nebs
   .
   # ARF
[**2-10**] ATN in the setting of shock, contrast nephropathy.
   Non-oliguric and creatinine is improving with good urine output
   - diuresis with lasix gtt as above
   - trend Cr
   .
   # Anemia
 Hct stable over several days; unclear baseline; recent GIB
   w/ C-scope showing colonic AVM that was cauterized
   -daily hct
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets continue to trend down slowly, at 105K
   most likely [**2-10**] infection and liver failure. Overall, had had a
   decrease from 276
 105K over last 10 days. Low probability for HIT
   - continue to monitor.
   - d/w heme-onc re:possibility of HIT
   .
   # Afib - atrial fibrillation with rate-related aberrancy. Heart rate
   stable in 90-100
s. INR trending down and is currently sub-therapeutic.
   Had recent Gi bleed but [**2-10**] colonic AVM which was cauterized therefore
   at low risk to re-bleed
   - restart BB when hemodynamically stable
   - start heparin gtt for now, hold coumadin until medically stable
   - trend INR
   .
   # Back pain
 Likely [**2-10**] chronic lumbar back disease.
   -low dose narcotics to manage pain, limit tylenol use
   -OOB to chair
   -monitor clinical symptoms and exam for now
   -consider imaging of back if pain worsens

   #DM
 well-controlled
