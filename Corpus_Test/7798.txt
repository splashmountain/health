Findings
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%). Mild resting LVOT
gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Mild (1+) AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Myxomatous
mitral valve leaflets. Mitral valve annuloplasty ring.
Well-seated mitral annular ring with normal gradient. [**Male First Name (un) **] of
mitral valve leaflets. No MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Normal tricuspid valve supporting structures. No TS. Mild [1+]
TR. Borderline PA systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - bandages,
defibrillator pads or electrodes.
Conclusions
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%) There is a mild resting
left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets
are myxomatous. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. The
mitral annular ring appears well seated and is not obstructing
flow. There is systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve
leaflets. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2962-6-3**], the mitral valve has been repaired (ring
annuloplasty); however, there is now systolic anterior motion of
the anterior mitral leaflet with mild left ventricular outflow
tract obstruction.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2962-6-16**] Mr [**Known patient lastname **] was taken to the OR where he underwent a
Mitral Valve repair with #34mm CE physio ring. Please refer to
DrKhabbaz's operative note for further details. Cross clamp
time:49" Cardiopulmonary bypass time:64". He was transferred to
the CVICU intubated on propofol and Neo to optimize his blood
pressure and cardiac output. He was extubated without incident
and tubes and lines were discontinued in a timely fashion. POD#1
he had a near syncopal [**Known patient lastname 10584**] and was treated with volume for
orthostatic hypotension. EKG changes postop were evident with ST
elevations and a intermittent LBBB. Mr [**Known patient lastname **] was started on
Ibuprofen for pericarditis. POD #2 he was doing well and
transferred to the floor. Further tele monitoring revealed LBBB
resolved. Beta blocker was optimized and he remains
hemodynamically stable. On [**2962-6-22**] it was felt that Mr [**Known patient lastname **]
was doing well and was ready to be discharged to home with VNA
services.
