   Assessment and Plan
   53 M h/o cryptogenic cirrhosis awaiting transplant, portal HTN, pulm
   HTN, chronic diastolic dysfunction, PE and Afib on coumadin admitted
   for elective RHC demonstrating acute on chronic LV diastolic CHF and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   .
   #Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: negative 2.4L LOS; PAD improving with
   diuresis and afterload reduction but not yet optimal; borderline low CI
   and elev. SVR may suggest need for further afterload reduction
   -cont diuresis to goal PAD 21-23 mmHg (PCWP 16-18 mmHg)
   -assess wedge today
   -goal -1 L today
   -incr. captopril prn for improved afterload reduction
   .
   #Pulm HTN
 PAD remain elevated due to left-sided CHF; not
   NO-responsive per cath [**3221-4-5**]
   -cont amlodipine although not likely to produce substantial response
   given lack of vasodilator responsive
   -treat left-sided CHF, as above
   .
   #DVT/PE
   -resume heparin for subtherapeutic INR
   -cont coumadin goal INR [**3-16**]
   .
   #Afib
 rate well-controlled, however he would benefit from being in
   NSR with improved cardiac filling from atrial kick
   -obtain OSH information re:duration of afib and anti-coagulation
   -cont heparin/coumadin
   -cont lopressor
   .
   #Cirrhosis - awaiting transplant. Will discuss with transplant team
   re:appropriate parameters that would be acceptable for surgical
   intervention
   -continue rifaxamin, lactulose
   .
   #HTN: well-controlled
   -continue BB, CCB
