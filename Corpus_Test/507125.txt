Cardiology Fellow Admit Addendum
   Please see CCU resident admit  note for complete details of HPI, PMH,
   Medications, SH/FH.
   In brief, this is a complex 84 y.o. man with:
   1.  Ischemic cardiomyopathy LVEF ~ 25%
   2.  PAD s/p R axillo-bifem on [**3-4**], with re-op for chest wall hematoma
   [**3-5**]
   3.  Atrial fibrillation
   4.  RV ICD lead fracture dxd by CXR [**2555-12-28**] in s/o hip fracture;
   defib functions deactivated.
   Hospital course post-op notable for prior WCT requiring cardioversion;
   by report his ICD lead was found to be fractured, and it was hoped that
   revision might be deferred until his other issues stablized.
   Was called to bedside on [**3-8**] in the evening for WCT (LBBB, superior
   axis) at 140 with a stable blood pressure.  Morphology c/w VT.  Treated
   with amiodarone bolus 150mg x 2 and gtt, magnesium, with intermittent
   conversion to SR and also possible runs of AF.
   Currently stable in SR with HR 80s; actually tolerated all these events
   with remarkable stoicism.
   Impression
   Complex and fragile 84 y.o. man with lengthy hospital course for
   management of his significant PAD, s/p peripheral revascularization and
   re-op for bleeding, now with what appears to be hemodynamically
   tolerated slow VT.
   He is now stable in sinus rhythm, s/p amiodarone bolus (300mg) and
   receiving gtt.  Also received magnesium empirically.
   Would hope to avoid any additional anti-arrhythmic agents given his
   mild renal insufficiency and poor systolic reserve.
   He is not an ideal candidate for an expedited lead revision
   discussed with Vascular service, his thoracic vascular anatomy is quite
   abnormal and he has extensive superficial arterial collaterals that
   would need careful consideration peri-procedure.
   I would favor a strategy of arrhythmia suppression with beta-blocker
   and amiodarone pending clinical improvement, with lead revision to
   follow.
   Further plans as detailed by admitting resident note.
   Case discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6546**], CCU Vist.
