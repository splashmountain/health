   Assessment and Plan
   81M with ischemic heart dz EF 30%, p/w septic shock and multiorgan
   failure from CAP PNA complicated by VAP, currently on CVVH w/
   intermittent pressor requirement. Current infectious issues include C.
   diff colitis and intra-abd fungal/GNR abscess.
   .
   #. Shock/Hypotension:   Was initially hypotensive in setting of septic
   shock.  Had Early Goal Directed Therapy with Apache IV score of 114.
   PNA, C. diff, intra-abdominal abscess are likely sources for sepsis.
   [**Month (only) 56**] also have cardiogenic component to shock as pt has ischemic heart
   disease with EF 20-30%, MvO2 = 52% on [**4-11**], PaO2 26-27 on [**4-14**].  Had
   A-line pulled on [**4-12**] and are unable to obtain central pressure
   monitoring; Has thigh cuff now but insure if cuff BP measurements are
   accurate. Continues on levophed/vasopressin w/ improved mental status
   and decrease in lactate. Continues on Midodrine TID.
   -  Attempt to wean pressors as tolerated, with plan to wean levophed
   first.
   - Continue to monitor pressure with goal MAP 60, SBP 90, clear
   mentation.
   .
   #. Resp failure/ ARDS: ARDS secondary to PNA. Patient trached on [**3-25**].
   On Vent, Assist Control. Has tolerated a few hours of PS each day.
   Possible evidence RLL PNA on CT [**4-15**]. On cefepime, which should cover
   GNR infection that he previously had. New BAL and sputum cultures
   negative. Will reevaluate if spikes fever. [**Month (only) 56**] have component of
   anxiety contributing to dyspnea. Continue zyprexa 5mg [**Hospital1 **], prn, for
   anxiety.
   - Continue Pressure Support trials as tolerated.
   .
   #.Abdominal Pain
 Patient w/ new [**2523-8-14**] abdominal pain since
   yesterday morning. Gastric contents changed from bilious to maroon
   sludge, gastro-occult positive yesterday. Stool guaiac negative.
   Pigtail output much clearer, green than previously. No nausea. LFTS
   elevated but stable from yesterday, Hct stable, amylase/lipase normal.
   Has had elevated transaminases earlier in hospital course likely due to
   shock liver. New concern for gastric ulcer, cholangitis, diverticulitis
   +/- perforation, vs new ischemic injury to liver. Morphine/Dilaudid prn
   for pain.
   - Hold Tube Feeds for now.
   - KUB- no free air
   - CT abd/pelvis
 no significant change per conversation with
   radiology. F/u final read
   - Surgery consult as needed.
   .
   #.Leukocytosis
 Completed 11 days of Meropenem for pansensitive
   Serratia and Klebsiella HAP. Abd abscess growing [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 176**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8265**]
   sensitive to Fluc and pan-[**Last Name (un) **] Serratia, drained w/ IR on [**4-10**], pigtail
   in place. Galactomannin negative; beta-glucan was cancelled due to
   hemolyzed sample.  Started Fluconazole [**4-9**] and [**Last Name (un) **] [**4-12**] for
   intra-abdominal abscess. Switched fluc to micafungin [**4-15**] and gave
   vanco IV x 1 given worsening clinical status.  CT Abd (w/out IV
   contrast) [**4-15**] showed smaller air and fluid collection adjacent to
   duodenum. [**4-18**] CT abd/pelvis showing little change per prelim read.
   - Continue Cefepime (Day 1 Cefepime [**2522-4-13**]) and fluconazole (Day 1 Fluc
   [**2522-4-9**]
 was switched to micafungin then back to fluconazole when
   [**Female First Name (un) 176**] came back sensitive to fluc) for intra-abdominal abscess.
   - On PO vanc and IV flagyl for c. diff. Treat 14 day course for C. diff
   when cefepime is d/c
d again. Pt may ultimately require a taper to
   prevent recurrence.
   - F/U further ID recs
   - F/U repeat Blood Cx
   - Had regions of hypoattenuation in liver and spleen again seen on [**4-18**]
   CT Abdomen, which could be small abscesses vs infarcts. Not drainable
   due to small size. We are unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker to
   further characterize.
   - continue with daily pigtail flushes until abscess resolved on imaging
   or no further drainage.
   .
   #. Oliguric, acute on chronic ARF/Uremia: Baseline Cr 2.3.  Patient in
   ARF from ATN in setting of hypotension. On CVVH and currently due to
   tenuous blood pressure. Renal U/S obtained due to anuria, and no
   evidence of obstruction found. Per renal, consider adding 12.5g Albumin
   [**Hospital1 **] to help with anasarca. Holding albumin at this time as unsure of
   clinical benefit and peripheral edema dramatically improved today.
   Albumin [**4-17**] 1.7, likely nutritional.
   - Renal following, appreciate further recs
   - Continue EPO
   - Continue CVVH until afternoon and plan to take volume out as much as
   tolerated, then CVVH holiday for the rest of the day to allow patient
   to sit up and move around a bit. Plan on intermittent HD starting
   tomorrow.
   - If afebrile with continuing decreased WBC count, consider placing
   tunneled line for HD early next week ([**4-20**]).
   .
   #Anemia
 Patient has anemia of chronic disease, limited benefit from
   iron supp, but little harm to give it. Folate nl, B12 high, evidence of
   ongoing hemolysis b/c has persistently low hapto, high LDH, high D
   Bili. Also evidence low-grade DIC with high FDP, low fibrinogen. Stool
   guaiac negative. Appropriate reticulocytosis. Pt tested super Coombs
   positive (DAT) but on repeat testing on [**4-10**] Coombs neg. Will not repeat
   Super Coombs per Heme. Should only transfuse in emergency settings of
   active ischemia given h/o delayed transfusion reaction. Blood bank has
   1 U frozen for this patient and is working to obtain more from the Red
   Cross. DIC labs worsened yesterday.
   - appreciate heme recs: check hemolysis labs daily, guaiac stool ; f/u
   further recs.
   - Continue Procrit, Fe++ po; folate 4mg Qday
   .
   #Coagulopathy: Likely component of shock liver, subacute DIC, and poor
   nutrition. Platelets gradually decreasing over the course of the
   hospital stay. Found to be HIT+ [**4-11**], but SRA negative [**4-16**]. **Pt needs
   separate order for platelet count daily.
   - F/U daily coags and correct INR with vitamin K if has signs of
   bleeding or requires procedure.
   - Follow DIC labs daily. Per heme, if fibrinogen < 100, give cryo.
   Spoke with Blood Bank and Pt should not have issues receiving cryo
   transfusions.
   - Per heme, suspicion for HIT is quite low. Will not anticoagulate with
   argatroban but will hold heparin for now.
   .
   #Left Upper Extremity Swelling: Resolved. No evidence DVT on U/S x 2
   but ?distal stenosis of left subclavian.
   - Continue to monitor strength/sensation/pulses in L arm. No
   intervention at this time.
   .
   #Dysphonia
 due to cuffed 8.0 trach
   - Will hold off changing to smaller cuff until resp status improves
   - ENT consult as needed as outpatient, confirmed with ENT and IP on
   [**2522-3-31**]. Got PMV on [**3-30**].
   .
   #Mental Status: Alert and oriented x 3. Mental status improved today.
   Frustrated with long ICU stay and illness. Continue to monitor as
   pressors are weaned.
   - Frequent reorientation; maintain sleep-wake cycle.
   - Hold Ativan. Use Zyprexa [**Hospital1 **]:PRN for agitation.
   .
   #CV: Stable. CK elevated in the setting of hypovolemia/shock. No
   ischemic EKG changes.  Will recheck CK today given ongoing hypotension.
   CAD: CABG [**2501**] with multiple PCI.  Continue ASA, statin, re-start BB
   when pressures stable.
   PUMP: EF 29%.  Off of pressors, rpt echo EF 25%
   RHYTHM: CHB s/p DDD PCM,ICD in [**2515**]. Not on Warfarin.
   - Maintain on telemetry
   - Maintain Hct >21, ideally >25, but issues with transfusing, see
   above.
   - Continue midodrine, levophed/vasopressin as needed.
   .
   #Tremor: Pt has new resting and action tremor in bilateral hands.
   Differential includes side effect of levophed, neuropathy from chronic
   illness, and ongoing hypocalcemia. Given multiple other issues at this
   time, would not be worthwhile to work up tremor with neurology. Will
   continue to monitor and initiate workup if tremor persists after more
   acute issues resolve.
