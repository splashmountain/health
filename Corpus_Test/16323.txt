ADDENDUM:  This addendum to the previous discharge summary is
to contain the brief hospital course from [**2-8**] until
the date of discharge.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.) Cardiovascular:  Ischemia.  The patient
episodes of chest pain.  There was no evidence that she might
be having active myocardial ischemia.  She was continued on
her aspirin and Lipitor.

In the past, she has been unable to tolerate a beta blocker
and an attempt was not made to start this medication.

congestive heart failure, as evidenced by x-ray and
continuous crackles on examination.  She was intravascularly
depleted but total body volume over loaded. Our approach to
this condition was to initially try to replete intravascular
volume with normal saline but then try to remove some of the
total fluid overload by giving intravenous Bumex.

Our decision to pursue this approach was particularly
afforded by her electrolytes which showed contraction
alkalosis and hyponatremia which was pointing towards severe
intravascular volume depletion.  After about a week, she had
good results with improvement in her intravascular volume
with good urine output, with continuing to be negative on a
daily basis.  Towards the end of this course, we decided to
start the patient on a small dose of ace inhibitor, given the
proven benefit of this medication in congestive heart
failure.

3.) Rhythm.  The patient remained in sinus rhythm throughout.

4.) Hematology. The patient was continued on her Coumadin for
the iliac stent.  Upon discharge, her dose was being
held given that she had a level of 4.8.  Her dose
can be restarted soon after discharge, to maintain a goal of
2.5 to 3.5 INR.

5.) Renal.  The patient is believed to be in acute renal
failure, as a result of aggressive diuresis and contracture
alkalosis. This was corrected by gentle hydration, followed
by diuresis, in which we were able to replete intravascular
volume while removing some of the total body fluid over load.
She had significant improvement in sodium, chloride and
bicarbonate.  Once we had an improvement in her creatinine,
from starting at 2.6 to about 1.9, we decided that she should
be restarted on her Captopril as this medication is
particularly beneficial for her congestive heart failure.
Mild increase in creatinine would be expected and would not
be particularly worrisome.

6.) Musculoskeletal.  The patient has been complaining of a
significant amount of leg pain.  This can be a combination of
significant edema from congestive heart failure, combined
with osteo insufficiency from iliac thrombi and multiple
procedures.  Her pain can be further exacerbated by extensive
pedal immobility secondary to sick, complicated
hospitalization.  Pain is well controlled with Percocet and
Neurontin.  There is no evidence of current vascular
compromise.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISPOSITION:  Discharged to a rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 25%.
