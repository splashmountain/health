AD[**Last Name (STitle) **]N HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 53 year-old
woman who presently with known residual of ventricular septal
defect and double chamber right ventricle. She previously had
had a repair and resection of the infundibulum in [**2711**] but
has been having increasingly limited amounts of physical
activity and increasing dyspnea. She was seen by the [**Location (un) 211**]
Adult Congenital Heart Service and on her preoperative work
up was found to have a double chambered right ventricle with
a 50 to 55 mmHg gradient between the infundibular region of
the right ventricle and the remainder of the right ventricle
and also a membranous ventricular septal defect which
communicated between the body of the right ventricle and
beneath the aortic valve. She did have normal coronary
arteries. She was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for elective
surgical repair.

ADMISSION EXAMINATION:  Her weight was 62.6 kilograms, her
temperature was 97.5 with a pulse of 71 and blood pressure
110/67. She is breathing 20 and saturating 93% on room air.
She is otherwise not in any distress and appeared generally
healthy. She had no rashes, ecchymosis or jaundice. Her lungs
were clear. Her heart was regular. She had a palpable thrill
with a IV/VI systolic ejection murmur radiating throughout
the precordium. There was no right ventricular heave. Her
abdomen was otherwise soft. She had no edema and her pulses
were normal throughout.

Her preoperative cardiac catheterization showed no
significant coronary disease and her preoperative MRI showed
likely obstruction of the distal infundibulum and normal left
ventricular global systolic function.

PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY DATA:  Were notable for a hematocrit
of 43 and BUN/creatinine of 15/0.6.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2739-4-18**]
for preoperative preparation and evaluation. Upon admission
she was noted to have a diffuse erythematous rash. The
dermatology service was consulted. They felt that this was
likely secondary to either contact allergy or a drug allergy
and recommended oral antihistamines but otherwise did not
feel this was an infectious process. The rash resolved quite
quickly and she was therefore taken to the operating room on
[**4-19**] as planned with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and Dr. [**Doctor Last Name 40340**]
from [**Hospital 211**] [**Hospital3 1536**]. At this time she underwent
closure of her ventricular septal defect with a pericardial
patch. She had repair and reconstruction of her right
ventricular outflow tract with pericardial patch and also
pulmonic valve replacement with a 25 mm Thermofit aortic
valve. The crossclamp time was 24 minutes and her
cardiopulmonary bypass time was 100 minutes. There were no
intraoperative complications. The patient was stable in the
operating room and was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery
Intensive Care Unit immediately postoperatively. She remained
somewhat sedated but hemodynamically stable on postoperative
day zero and therefore remained intubated until the morning
of postoperative day #1 at which time she was extubated
without difficulty. Notably in the initial postoperative
period she had frequent premature ventricular contractions
and premature atrial contractions. Her electrolytes were
managed appropriately and we decided to treat these with beta
blockade and avoid the use of amiodarone. She otherwise did
quite well postoperatively as noted, was extubated on
postoperative day #1 at which time she started a clear liquid
diet which was advanced without difficulty. We removed the
Swan-Ganz catheter on postoperative day #1 and patient was up
out of bed to a chair. She began diuresis with Lasix on
postoperative dat #1 with a goal of returning to her
preoperative weight. The chest tubes were removed on
postoperative day #2 along with continued diuresis and
continued beta blockade with Lopressor. Her ectopy seemed to
improve with better beta blockade. She was transferred to the
floor on postoperative day #3. She had physical therapy began
working with her aggressively improving her rehabilitation
potential. She continued to diurese quite well. Pacer wires
were removed on postoperative day #5. We repeated the
patient's echocardiogram on postoperative day #5. The
echocardiogram was notable for an ejection fraction of 30%
with depressed left ventricular systolic function but
otherwise no significant abnormality. This was felt to be
secondary possibly to her level of beta blockade but as the
patient was stable it was felt that this could be monitored
safely in an outpatient setting. Therefore, on postoperative
day #6 she was discharged to home in good condition.

At[**Last Name (STitle) 40341**]ime of her discharge her hematocrit was 26 and her
BUN and creatinine were 9 and 0.6. Her chest x-ray showed no
evidence of significant effusion. She was discharged home on
the following medications: Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., Zantac
150 mg p.o. b.i.d. for two weeks, aspirin 81 mg p.o. once
daily, Darvocet 100 - 650 mg tablets take one tablet every
four hours as needed for pain with a note to limit
acetaminophen intake to less than 2 grams per day, Percocet 1
tablet as needed p.r.n. pain. Note to limit acetaminophen
intake to 2 grams per day, ibuprofen 600 mg p.o. q 6 hours,
Toprol XL 50 mg p.o. once daily, Captopril .25 mg p.o.
t.i.d., Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. for seven days, potassium
chloride tablets 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. for seven days, Synthroid
50 mcg p.o. once daily. She is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in three to four weeks and follow up with her
cardiologist within one to two weeks and her primary care
physician upon return to [**Male First Name (un) 1269**].
