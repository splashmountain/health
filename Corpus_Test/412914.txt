   59 y/o male with PMH of systolic CHF, hx of transudative pleural
   effusions, admitted with bradycardia and acute on chronic CHF initially
   managed with fluid resulting in worsening heart failure transferred to
   MICU for hypoxia.
   # Dyspnea / Hypoxia
 likely CHF exacerbation and CAP
   - oxygenating and ventilating well on AC 550 x 18, PEEP 5, 40% FIO2
   - Continues to diurese well.  Was negative ~2L yesterday
   - will attempt to wean to PS this AM and extubate
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Completed his ceftriaxone for CAP yesterday
   # Recurrent Left Pleural Effusion
 was tapped in [**6-4**]
   - continue to monitor for changes in CXR
   - will check CT without contrast due to prior CT showing trapped lung
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1936**] emailed IP/Thoracics on Monday re: Trapped lung
   (decortication vs. pleuridesis), awaiting reply
   # Systolic CHF
   - unclear etiology (per cards, possibly some component of alcohol
   cardiomyopathy and possibly some tachy-myopathy)
   - will continue metoprolol and will continue to hold hydralazine, as
   patient is normotensive
   - will d/c lasix gtt and provide boluses as needed
   - pt can possibly be started on an ACEi in the long term
   # Alcohol Abuse
 Reported h/o DTs with seizures, appears he is over
   this window
   - continue MVI, thiamine, and folate
   - follow-up B12
   - F/u social work recs
 SW says that they will see the patient when he
   is able to communicate
    # Atrial Fibrillation
   - HR still elevated
   - Metoprolol to 125 mg TID; per PCP this has been a problem in the past
   as well and he has required upto 300 mg
   - will hold off on restarting diltiazem at this point
   - pt not on coumadin per personal preference, on ASA
   # ARF
   - current creatinine 0.9
 trending down
   - continue to monitor UOP, BUN, and Cr
   # Anemia
   - pt
s hematocrit is currently 24.9
 will transfuse if Hct drops below
   21
   - guaiac stools
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type II
   - on ISS
   # Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium
   # Hyponatremia / Hypochloremia
   - hyponatremia resolved
 will continue to monitor to see if it
   corrects with diuresis
   - will continue to check lytes
   # Thrombocytopenia - resolving
   - will continue to monitor platelet level
   - will avoid medications that worsen
   # Elevated INR
