   EKG: widening PR interval, now approx 440, increased from
   Assessment and Plan
   31yo gentleman with h/o HIV not on HAART, ESRD on HD, and h/o coag neg
   Staph endocarditis s/p MVR/AVR [**3-23**] admitted with fevers and diarrhea,
   now w/ GPC POS BCx. Pt presents good clinical picture for bacterial
   endocarditis.
   # Bacterial Endocarditis:
   Patient is immunocompromised and has a history of endocarditis.  Of
   note, he has had prior recent admission in [**9-/2863**] with similar
   symptoms.  TTE and TEE findings as well as S. viridans bacteremia new
   PR prolongation on EKG are consistent with this diagnosis.  Other, ddx
   for his fevers would include CMV colitis, viral gastroenteritis, C diff
   colitis, or [**Doctor First Name **].  He responded appropriately to volume challenge and
   his blood pressures have been stable in 90s/50s since presentation to
   the MICU.  Although initially febrile, he was 94.8 and then 95.1 upon
   presentation to the MICU.  Would also have concern for CNS process
   given headaches and unequal pupils on exam, although clinical
   presentation does not suggest bacterial meningitis.  Of note, LP done
   [**9-/2863**] was negative.  CXR does not show infiltrate. EP consulted, and
   believe he has a poor prognosis and requires surgical intervention.  CT
   surgery consulted, and is waiting for final [**Doctor Last Name 1222**] from TEE before
   deciding on course.
   - F/u final read of TEE and discuss surgical plans with CT [**Doctor First Name 438**]
   - Continue Vanc/gent and flagyl with renal dosing
   - TID EKG
   - f/u BCx and fungal cultures and speciation
   - check CMV and stool C diff, O&P, stool Cx
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - Pacer pads kept at bedside.
   # Intubated for airway protection for multiple procedures.
   - Extubation plan based on CT surgery assessment which will require the
   final read on the TEE.
   - VAP bundle
   # Anisocoria - Planed to obtain MRI of head as has bacteremia and HIV
   and focal neurological finding. MRI without gad given ESRD.  Pt was
   unable to tolerate MRI.  Currently patient seems at high risk to leave
   floor.
   - Imaging is low priority, but will consider once cardiac issues have
   been addressed.
   # ESRD on HD:
   - HD yesterday, further per renal.
   - continue nephrocaps, phoslo, cinacalcet, and sevelamer
   - monitor lytes closely
   - appreciate renal input
   # Oral thrush:
   - nystatin swich and swallow, applying as swab while intubated
   # HIV with CD 4 count of 34:
   Not on HAART as he does not tolerate it.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue bactrim (currently on weekly bactrim, may need to adjust
   dose per ID)
   # Hyponatremia:  Resolved.  Likely was hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   # Anemia: At baseline
   - receiving Epo with dialysis
   - monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia: Current platelets 107, baseline 80-200
   [**Month (only) 56**] be low in setting of acute infection.  Also may be secondary to
   hepatosplenomegaly (chronic on his imaging).
   - monitor
   # Asthma:
   - continue albuterol
   # Elevated INR:
   Unclear if nutritional or if he has coagulopathy.  His INR is at his
   baseline.
   - Vitamin K given today
   -monitor
   # HTN:
   Of note, he has had problems with hypertension in the past but his
   nephrologist reports that his BP has been increasingly easy to control
   of late
   - hold metoprolol while hypotensive
   # Elevated Alk Phos:
   Chronic.  Most likely from bone as bone alk phos was elevated when
   checked in past.  Nephrologist planning on bone scan.
   # HCV/HBV:
   - LFTs at baseline.
   .
   # Chronic pain and h/o opioid dependance:
   - contine methadone 40mg tid
   # FEN: NPO while intubated, careful with IV fluids for pressure support
   only as needed as he does not make urine. If needs to stay intubated,
   will consider TF.
   # Glycemic control
   # Access
 2 PIVs, 18g , 20g will attempt to place another 18g line.
   # PPx:  subQ heparin, famotidine while in ICU
   # Code:  confirmed FULL
   # Dispo:  ICU for now.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 31M HIV/AIDS, endocarditis c/b AVR/MVR,
   diarrhea, fever, poor PO intake p/w fever and hypotension at HD.
   Colitis on CT, high grade GPC bacteremia.   Intubated for TEE which
   showed suspected aortic root abscess but no vegetations.  1^st degree
   AV block continues to progress.  Cards/EP following
 feels high
   mortality without surgical intervention.  CT [**Doctor First Name 438**] evaluating for OR but
   feel too risky and desire for medical mgmt unless hand forced by
   precipitous decline .  Pt notes discomfort from ETT and LBP (chronic).

   Continuing to attempt clarification but might not be achievable until

   meantime, given progressive prolongation of pr interval (though have
   not witnessed any dropped beats) maintain intubated, external pacer at
   bedside.  EP and CT [**Doctor First Name 438**] following closely.   Follow up cx results,
   repeat BCx daily with [**Hospital1 **] EKGs. Anisocoria

   of illness, hold off on MRI for now.  Remainder of plan as outlined
