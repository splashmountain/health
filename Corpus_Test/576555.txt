Chief Complaint:  hypotension
   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7528**] is an 88M with CAD, afib on warfarin, AS, and h/o GIB who
   presented on [**3-1**] with melena x2. In the ED, VS: 96.2, 54, 136/69, 96%
   RA. He was trace guiac positive on rectal exam. He was started on
   protonix and admitted for further workup.
   .
   Since admission, Hcts have trended down from 31.3->27.1, for which he
   received 1 units PRBCs this AM. NG lavage was negative. He was taken to
   EGD today but unable to get the procedure [**3-12**] acute onset of low back
   pain. Per his daughter this has not happened before. He was given 2mg
   of dilaudid which made him very groggy.
   .
   Back on the floor, he was hypotensive to the 70's initially with
   improvement to the 80's systolic following NS boluses. With time, his
   mental status did improve back to baseline. MICU was called to evaluate
   given persistent hypotension. Of note, urine culture obtained [**3-1**] has
   grown >100,000 E coli. SBPs improved from 80's to low 100's overnight
   following IVF resuscitation.
   .
   On initial floor eval, patient denied any further chest, back, or
   abdominal discomfort, cough, diarrhea. He had some recent dysuria and
   hematuria.

   Assessment and Plan
   This 88M with h/o afib on warfarin, CAD, AS, and GIV presents with
   melena x2 and is transferred to the MICU for further management of
   hypotension.
   .
   1. Septic shock
   Hypotension most likely secondary to E coli urosepsis given +E coli
   recent culture, though surprising that UA completely unremarkable. Labs
   concerning today for marked bandemia. Fortunately his blood pressure
   has improved with IVF resuscitation. Think other common infections such
   as C. diff or pna less likely. Hypotension yesterday may have been
   exacerbated by large dose of dilaudid.
   - Continue ceftriaxone; should be adequate gram negative coverage as he
   is community dwelling without history of more resistant GNs. Will add
   vancomycin empirically and will discontinue if no gram positives
   isolated
   - Follow up blood and urine cultures, reculture if febrile
   - Place central line, fluid resuscitation to CVP 8-12
   - Target MAP>65, following urine output
   - Repeat ABG/lactate
   - Hold off on sedating meds
   .
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure
   Most concerning for ATN in the setting of hypotension. Obstruction [**3-12**]
   blood clot possible but less likely - no hydronephrosis on CTU
   - Check UA/UCX, urine lytes
   - Renally dose meds, follow urine output
   - Hold lasix
   - If minimal urine output will d/w renal
   .
   3. Anemia, h/o GIB and hematuria
   No further gross bleeding over hematuria overnight, Hct ~stable since
   transfusion yesterday AM
   - Type and cross, transfuse hct>25
   - Follow hct q6
   - Continue PPI IV bid
   - EGD when stabilized
   - Follow up final CTU read
   .
   4. Thrombocytopenia
   Concern for consumption in setting of infection
   - Check smear, fibrinogen, FDP as part of DIC workup
   .
   5. Back pain
   Now resolved. Considerations include pyelonephritis, or early protean
   presentation of sepsis.
   6. Aortic stenosis
   Moderate on [**3052**] echo. Will need to monitor respiratory status closely
   given potential for fluid overload.
   7. CAD
   Not on antiplatelet agents as an outpatient presumably given GIB
   Continue pravastatin.
   8. Atrial fibrillation
   Auto rate controlled off beta blockers. No plans to restart
   anticoagulation given h/o bleeding.
   9. Myasthenia continue home pyridostigmine
   10. BPH continue finasteride and tamsulosin
   11. Hypothyroidism continue levothyroxine
   12. Dementia continue donepezil, avoid sedating meds as possible
