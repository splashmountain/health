   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -CXR: worsening opacity in RLL, increased haziness in L base - ? new
   consolidation; recommend CT chest as pt had PNA in same area of RLL
   last year
   - talked to outpatient provider who says pt just completed course of
   ciprofloxacin x 10 days in [**Month (only) 1349**] and azithromycin course last summer

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Known patient firstname 1488**] [**Known patient lastname 9582**] is a 81 yo female with a history of CAD who presented
   with an STEMI s/p cath.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient with anterior STEMI.  SVG found to be completely
   occluded and a BMS was placed in the proximal LAD.
   - plavix 75 and aspirin 325mg daily
   - metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID
   - hold ACEi, as BP has been low
   - Echo with akinesis
 pt started on heparin gtt overnight
   - atorvastatin 80mg PO daily
   - monitor CE, currently downtrending
   .
   # PUMP:  patient appears clinically euvolemic, however, patient with
   substantial oxygen requirement concerning for pulmonary edema. ECHO
   with EF 30-35%. SOB did not improve with Lasix overnight.
   # RHYTHM: currently in normal sinus rhythm.  Few episodes of NSVT.
   - will monitor on tele.
   .
   # Hypoxia: currently in low 90s on 6L.  Hypoxia most likely secondary
   to pulmonary edema in setting of stiff ventricle.  Patient recently
   completed 2 full abx courses for PNA. CXR with worsening RLL opacity
   and new L haziness concerning for PNA. Pt with long smoking history and
   mildly hyperinflated lungs
 likely retainer at baseline. Goal O2sat
   88-92%.
   - supplemental O2 prn
   - CT chest today
   - consider starting Abx for PNA
   .
   # Chronic renal insufficiency - patient with GFR 48.
   - renally dose medications & avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # HTN - currently mildly hypotensive. Monitor BP medications, make
   changes above.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia - will start atorvastatin as above.
   .
   # Macular Degeneration - continue vitamins & minerals
   .
   .
   FEN:  cardiac diet.
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with Hep SQ
   -Bowel regimen with colace & senna
   .
   CODE: Presumed full
   .
   COMM:  [**Name (NI) 438**] & [**Name2 (NI) 239**]
   .
