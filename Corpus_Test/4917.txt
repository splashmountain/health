Brief Hospital Course:
[**Doctor Last Name **] wards:
1. Humeral fracture: pt initially presented with right humeral
fracture here for repair. She was admitted for management of her
medical issues and for repair by orthopedics. Pt went to the OR
on [**6-28**].  Had surgical repair of complex humeral fracture.  On
surgical eval, a large hematoma was found.  PT received 1U PRBC
post op for hct 24.  Ortho followed patient for remainder of
hospital course.  On [**7-3**] insicion site was erythematous.  Pt to
receive Keflex for 7 day course. Also had ultrasound of site
which showed superficial hematoma. Pain was controlled with
oxycodone PRN and tylenol TID.
.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: On [**6-29**] pt found to be increasingly
hypoxic.  Tachycardia and shortness of breath also associated.
On evaluation by MICU team pt felt to have PE and was started on
Heparin.  (SEE MICU course).  CT showed left lingular PE.  After
transfer from MICU, pt was started on Heparin drip.  Then
coumadin was started originally at 5 mg dose.  Pt INR, PTT
supratherapeutic on [**7-4**], coumadin/heparin was held and coumadin
to be started as outpatient to keep INR [**1-20**] for chronic therapy
after PE.
.
3. [**Name (NI) 3623**] Pt initially had large hct drop on admission
secondary to fluid administration and blood loss.  Pt with low
hct for remainder of hospital stay despite 1 U prbc after
surgery.  On day of admission, u/s performed to evaluate
hematoma at incision site.  Hematoma found, but superficial.
Ortho consulted, they felt that there was no indication for
removal of hematoma.
--HCT should be checked daily until no longer dropping/ anemic.
IF HCT decreases, ultrasound should be done to verify if pt has
bleeding into humerus fx.
.
4. COPD: Pt with extensive smoking history.  Pt has no 02
requirement at home, but required 2-3 L to keep sats high 90%.
Events on [**6-29**] (PE) were clouded with COPD exacerbation as her
hypoxia was responsive to albuterol and ipratroprium nebs.  SEE
MICU course. After transfer out of the MICU, pt was continued on
02 and albuterol, advair.  This should be continued as out
patient.  Echo shows significant Pulm htn, CXR, CT show
extensive emphysema.
.
5. [**Name (NI) 20200**] Pt with Type II diabetes.  Blood sugars controlled
with insulin sliding scale.  [**Last Name (un) **] diabetic service was
consulted initially and continued to follow patient.  They
recommended keeping pt off oral hypoglycemics while inpatient.
They discouraged sulfonylureas while outpatient given the risk
of hypoglycemia in this patient.
.
6. [**Name (NI) **] Pt initially on anti-hypertensive agents while
inpatient, but these were held after MICU stay.  Pressures under
moderate control, but anti-hypertensives should be restarted
after d/c.
.
7. Code status- patient was made DNR/DNI after d/c from MICU.
.
MICU course:
While on the medicine floor on HD#4, the patient had three
episodes of desats. During the first episode the patient O2sats
fell to 85% on 40% FiO2. With nebulizer this improved to 94%.
She was also hypotensive to 88/40 and received 1L fluid bolus
with improvement to 108/50. The second trigger happened at 12pm.
The patient's vitals were as follows: BP 88/40, HR 104, RR30,
O2sats 88% on 40%FiO2. The patient become lethargic,
tacchycardic and tachypneic to the 30s. The patient received
12.5 mg of lopressor. The frequency of her nebs was increased to
Q4h, an EKG was done which showed 1mm ST depressions in the high
lateral leads and PACs, and a CXR was done which showed: recent
left humeral head repair and left lower lobe consolidation,
pleural effusion, which could be due to atelectasis and/or
infectious process. The patient triggered again at 3pm. Her
vitals were: T 99.3, HR 74, BP 104/48 O2sat 78-85 on 40%FiO2.
The patient was started on vanc/levo/flagyll. At that point the
team felt that the patient needed to come to the MICU for
further monitoring.  On admission to the MICU, the pt was
continued on levo/flagyl for presumed PNA, but vanc was d/c'd.
Initially, the pt was too belligerant to obtain a chest CT, so
she was empirically started on heparin given concern for PE. She
was given nebulizer treatments, and her O2 sats improved to the
90's on 6L NC.  She was able to undergo a chest CTA the
following day, which showed a L sided segmental PE, moderate
bilateral pleural effusions, and no consolidation.  She was
continued on heparin and her Abx were stopped.  Per her
daughter, the pt's mental status was more confused and combative
than usual, so a head CT was performed.
