   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known patient firstname **] [**Known patient lastname 7178**] is a 64 year old male wtih history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent
   elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement
   in his neurological status over the past week.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG. He is 3L positive length of stay.   Ge started Lasix 20mg IV x 2
   yesterday but did not meet goal of -500 cc.
   - Standing Lasix 40mg po BID to diurese, as receiving tube feeds and
   not self-diuresing
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - Family consented for MRI/MRA; will do this tomorrow to assess neuro
   status
   - CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens or via MRI
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. WBC
   increased to 11.3 today.  Febrile to 100.2 in last 24 hours and with
   low-grade fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent
   withdrawal in pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or
   tachycardic.
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora, last chest xray [**7-22**]
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**7-22**]) for total of 7 days; today is day
   [**5-7**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission; Increased ectopy (NSVT)
   overnight.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Increased metoprolol from 75 mg TID to 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   - If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #.CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metoprolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #.Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unable to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.  Will get MRI tomorrow.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #.[**Name (NI) 7181**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs
   continue to trend down, now close to nl in 60
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above
   #Access: Hold PICC for now as patient will be get lab draws q 3 days
