Brief Hospital Course:
Following transfer to [**Hospital1 22**] he remained stable and pain free.
Further workup was undertaken to delineate anatomy and stratify
his risk and care. Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1084**] cardiac catheterization
and coronary angiography, which revealed 100% LAD stenosis with
left collateralization, 90% RCA stenosis and a dilated aortic
root.  Non-invasive carotid study revealed no stenoses
bilaterally.  Echocardiography  showed a LVEF >55%, minimal AS
and an ascending aortic aneurysm of 5.2cm.  CT report from [**Hospital **] states ascending aortic aneurysm- 4.85cm.

On [**9-28**] he went to the operating room where the ascending
aorta was replaced utilizing a 30 mm gelweave graft and two
coronary grafts were performed (LIMA-LAD and SVG -RCA). He
weaned from bypass on low dose phenylephrine and propofol. He
remained stable upon transfer to the ICU and was weaned from the
pressor and extubated easily on the day after surgery.   Beta
blockade was resumed and diuretics begun.

He was transferred to the floor.  The CTs were removed on POD 3,
as were pacing wires.  He experienced  some nausea despite
normal bowel functioning, but otherwise did well.  He was
diuresed towards his preoperative weight. he did develop a
contraction alkalosis from diuresis and , therefor, aggressive
potassium chloride repletion was undertaken. he should have
electrolytes rechecked in [**3-24**] days after discharge.

He was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint and was
discharged for rehabilitation prior to returning home.
