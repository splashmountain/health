Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Goal fluid status -500 mL
   - Thrombocytopenia: will stop Vanc/Zosyn (Vanc could be contributing)
   and stop famotidine/pantoprazole. Most likely thrombocytopenia related
   to IABP.Did send off HIT Ab today.
   - ? Aspiration PNA: started Levaquin to replace Vanc/Zosyn
   -Holding Asacol per pharmacy (cannot crush PO and PR is only
   local).Emailed primary gastroenterologist re: PR Asacol.
   - Starting TF slowly
   - Afternoon gas showed improved O2 to 165 so FiO2 [**Month (only) 199**] to 50%-->repeat
   ABG O2 98 so FiO2 weaned to 40%
   - I/Os at 1730 showed -740 fluid balance p midnight but +190 since 8AM,
   with hourly UOP as low as 15cc/hr. Will re-check at 11PM and consider
   bolus/lasix.
   - Per GI ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6272**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6273**]), OK to hold Asacol if no signs of UC. If
   develops signs of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 114**] use low-dose prednisone.
   -O/N pressures remained labile. Small adjustements to dopamine
   corrects.
   -HR trending down, now in 50's--?autonomic dysregulation

   75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**3132**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and
   Diagonal), PVD, HTN, admitted with STEMI in perioperative period and
   now with cardiogenic shock s/p IABP.
   .
   # Cardiogenic Shock/STEMI. Latest Co/CI/SVR=7.3/3.9/722. Remains very
   labile O/N but less highs/lows than yesterday. Could be autonomic
   instability. Levophed has been weaned off yeaterday  and he remains on
   dopamine. Latest CO/CI/SVR = TTE yesterday demonstrated mildly
   depressed LVEF with EF 45-50%.
   - Plan to con
t  IABP on 1:1
   - Continue dopamine for enhanced cardiogenc shock pressor treatment,
   attempt to wean dopamine off today
   - Maintain MAP 60
   - continue ASA 325
   - plavix 75 daily
   - continue heparin gtt for IABP
   - continue simvastatin 80
    .
   # Cards Pump: Inferiolat hypokinesis persisted on ECHO yesterday.  Pt
   was negative 783 in last 24 hours. Lasix was held last night due to
   hypotension.  Cont afterload reduction with diuresis.
   -  Goal I/O
 1000 -500 cc with aggressive diuresis
   - afterload reduce with IABP
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR with rate 60-70
s for now.  Hold BB
   .
   # Anemia/thrombocytopenia: Hct dropped. Plts stable and likely [**3-11**]
   hemolysis from balloon pump. Hemolysis labs unremarkable. HIT is
   certainly possible and 4T score is intermediate, although unlikely
   given likely explanation is balloon pump. Plts now  stable
   - f/u Heparin dependent Ab, but will cont heparin given alternate more
   probable explanation
   - Stop meds that could be contributing: PPI, Vanc
   - Will continue heparin gtt/plavix for now
   - recheck Hct, hold on transfusion for now
   .
   # Vomiting: No episodes, restarted TF and tolerating.  [**Month (only) 11**] be due to
   UGIB or more likely ileus secondary to sedating meds.
   - No e/o obstruction or ileus on KUB
   - Limit sedating meds as much as possible
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure/Aspiration: Likely due to aspiration in Cath
   lab. Hypoxia likely due to edema, consolidation, and underlying COPD.
   FiO2 changed to 50% FiO2 overnight. Hoping that cont diuresis will
   improve oxygenation.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated levels as tolerated pending diuresis
   - frequent suctioning
   - MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD underlying
   - Continue levoflox  for aspiration.
   - F/u cx data and CIS
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Resolved.
   .
   # ARF: Cr 1.6.-baseline around 1.3   Suspect poor renal perfusion and
