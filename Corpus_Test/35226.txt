History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 62 year old male with known coronary disease, and
ischemic cardiomyopathy. His LVEF has been as low as 13% in the
past. With medical therapy, his LVEF has improved. His most
recent ECHO is from [**2594-9-22**] which showed and LVEF of 50%
with only mild MR. [**First Name (Titles) 3144**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] in [**2594-10-22**]
showed severe two vessel coronary artery and an LVEF of 45%.
Angiography showed only a mild 40% lesion in the LAD, 70%
circumflex stenosis, 90% lesion in the ramus, and a 70% stenosis
in the RCA. Given the above findings, he was referred to cardiac
surgical intervention.

Pertinent Results:
[**2594-11-4**] Intraop TEE:
Pre-Bypass:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion.
Post Bypass:
Left and right ventricular function is preserved. The aorta is
intact. The exam is unchanged.

Final Report
CHEST, PA AND LATERAL
REASON FOR EXAM: 62-year-old man, status post CABG, evaluate
pleural

Since [**2594-11-5**], small left pleural effusion decreased.
Minimal
bibasilar and right mid lung atelectasis also decreased. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are otherwise
unchanged. Note that epicardial wires are still in place.

gradient.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal views. Suboptimal
image quality - poor apical views. Suboptimal image quality -
poor subcostal views. Suboptimal image quality - bandages,
defibrillator pads or electrodes. Suboptimal image quality -
body habitus. Suboptimal image quality - ventilator.
Conclusions
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50%). The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There
is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was admitted and underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting surgery by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as a same day admit on [**11-4**]. For
surgical details, please see seperate dictated operative note.In
summary he had CABGx3 with SVG-Ramus-OM, SVG-RCA. His bypass
time was 60 minutes with a crossclamp of 52 minutes. He
tolerated the opeeration well. He was then transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring. He remained hemodynamically
stable and within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated. He remained hemodynamically stable  and was
transferred to the SDU on postoperative day one. Once on the
floor he had an uneventful post-operative course and on POD4 was
discharged home with visiting nurses. It should be noted that
after transfer from the ICU Mr [**Known patient lastname **] did experience a transient
elevation of his serum creatinine which has begun to trend back
toward normal ranges before discharge.
