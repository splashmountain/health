TITLE: Cardiology Fellow Admission Note Addendum
   Pt examined, discussed with CCU team.
   83 yo F w/ h/o lung ca ([**2926**]), DM, HTN who presented to [**Hospital 1211**]
   Hospital with reportedly 1 wk h/o progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and
   cough. At OSH, CTA was negative for PE but showed a large pericardial
   effusion and a large RUL mass with possible postobstructive PNA. She
   was given abx and transferred to [**Hospital1 17**] ED. Here a bedside pulsus
   paradoxus was >35 mm Hg. Echo showed a large circumferential
   pericardial effusion with RV diastolic collapse, indicative of
   tamponade physiology. She was taken to emergent pericardiocentesis,
   where ~610 cc of bloody fluid was drained, with immediate improvement
   in RHC hemodynamics (initial equalization of pressures, pericardial
   pressure ~35 mm Hg --> 2 mm Hg). She was intubated in the lab for
   respiratory fatigue and impending respiratory failure. On admission to
   CCU, hemodynamically stable (SBP 180s), intubated, pericardial drain in
   place.
   Imp:
   1. Cardiac tamponade, etiology of bloody effusion most likely [**2-20**]
   malignancy
   2. RUL mass, likely malignant
   3. Postobstructive PNA vs atelectasis
   Plan:
   1. Effusion likely malignant, but will send for routine studies
   2. Monitor drain output, pull when minimal (if in future reaccumulates,
   will need window)
   3. Obtain prior oncologic records for prior dx
   4. Involve oncology in am re further rx; may need to biopsy mass once
   PNA treated, will need pulmonary/ thoracics input re this in the near
   future
   5. Abx for likely postobstructive PNA and UTI
   6. Other plans as per housestaff note.
