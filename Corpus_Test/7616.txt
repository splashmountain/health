HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 72 year old man
with a past medical history of congestive heart failure,
diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, peripheral vascular
disease and chronic renal insufficiency who was initially
congestive heart failure and acute renal failure.  He had a
protracted hospital course and was intubated for bilateral
pneumonia and congestive heart failure.  He also ruled in for
an myocardial infarction.  His hospital course was also
complicated by hypoglycemia and hypothermia, and new onset
atrial fibrillation, mental status changes and acute renal
failure.  He was placed on Bi-PAP for question of obstructive
[**2741-11-11**].

However, he was only there for eight hours until he developed
acute shortness of breath and productive cough.  He was
hypoxic to 70% on two liters nasal cannula.  Arterial blood
gas revealed 7.45/50/30 and brought back to [**Hospital3 **]
for further evaluation.  Chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema
and he was diuresed with Bumex/Diuril with initial subjective
improvement.  He was readmitted to the Intensive Care Unit
for Bi-PAP.  He was on Levaquin initially started on [**11-11**]
for urinary tract infection.  He was initially diuresed with
Bumex and Hydrochlorothiazide and was eventually started on
Lasix gtt with supplemental Diuril twice a day.  Once
sensitivities returned on urine cultures, Pseudomonas
sensitive to Ciprofloxacin, Gent and Ceptaz, he was started
on Ceptaz and then Ciprofloxacin was added on [**11-12**].  Ceptaz
was discontinued on [**11-13**].  He did not succeed with trial of
Bi-PAP and was intubated on [**11-12**] with persistent hypoxemia.

He ruled in for an myocardial infarction, peak CPK of 339, MB
index of 8.9 and troponin peak of 10.5  He was started on
aspirin and Nitropaste.  A transesophageal echocardiogram was
done which showed a "new AS myocardial infarction" and
ejection fraction of 25 to 30%.  BUN/creatinine increased
from baseline range; creatinine 3.5 to 94/5.6 and urine
output fell to 20 to 30 cc per hour, FENA calculated at
3.26%.  He was subsequently started on amiodarone gtt and
Lasix gtt for management of presumptive cardiogenic shock and
congestive heart failure on [**11-14**].  Urine output initially
picked up to 70 cc per hour on this regimen.  He also had a
hematocrit drop to 24.6 and was transfused with 2 units of
packed red blood cells with appropriate increase in his
hematocrit.

Family requested transfer to [**Hospital1 186**] on [**2741-11-16**], for further management and dialysis,
ultra-filtration after there with no improvement on current
regimen.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 72 year old male
with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus,
coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure with
recent myocardial infarction and Pseudomonal urinary tract
infection, question urosepsis, that is complicated by
congestive heart failure and worsening oliguric, acute on
chronic renal failure, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-16**]
for further management of renal and cardiac issues.

1.      Pulmonary:  The patient was initially intubated for
pneumonia and congestive heart failure at [**Hospital3 **].
He was eventually extubated but placed on Bi-PAP.  The
patient was discharged to Rehabilitation on [**11-11**] but
returned with hypoxemic respiratory distress the same day
with arterial blood gas of 7.45/50/30.  Chest x-ray was
consistent with pulmonary edema and diuresed with
improvement.   Readmitted to the Intensive Care Unit for
Bi-PAP but eventually re-intubated on [**11-12**] for persistent
hypoxemia.

He was transferred here at the family's request intubated.
His congestive heart failure was treated as below but
apparently without significant improvement in chest x-ray.
Wean on pressure support was attempted on [**11-25**], and he was
eventually extubated on [**11-26**], but became hypoxemic to the
high 80s and reintubated after a trial of Bi-PAP on [**11-28**].
Thoracentesis was done on [**11-28**] for large bilateral pleural
effusion, and left drained approximately 1 liter consistent
with exudate and negative culture, thought to be consistent
with congestive heart failure.  On [**11-29**], given his
persistent congestive heart failure with Cardiology
consultation planning catheterization, he was transferred to
he CCU team.

Post catheterization and with continued dialysis, improved
pressure support of 15/5, extubated on [**12-4**].  He became
increasing hypercarbic and asked to wear Bi-PAP 15/5 FIO2 of
50% with some improvement.  However, the patient was
intermittently refusing Bi-PAP.  The patient was
intermittently weaned off Bi-PAP and remained off Bi-PAP on
[**12-12**] for approximately two days with no acute worsening in
arterial blood gas.  It was thought, however, that patient
would benefit from bi-PAP at night.  The patient had an
original gas off Bi-PAP 12 noon on [**12-10**] of 7.26/50/91.  The
patient continued on Bi-PAP until 5 p.m. when another
arterial blood gas was drawn which revealed a gas of
7.33/46/120.  At 2 a.m., 40% cool nebulizer arterial blood
gas revealed 7.34/44/95.  The patient had an a.m. arterial
blood gas on [**12-12**], revealing 7.30/49/85.  It was at this
time that the patient was thought to likely benefit from
Bi-PAP at night.

The patient was anticipating discharge to Rehabilitation with
this plan in place.  The patient, at times, subjectively
complains of dyspnea, however, arterial blood
gases during these times were essentially unrevealing for
worsening respiratory status.

2.      Cardiology:  Hemodynamically, the patient was
diuresed originally with Bumex/Diuril with initial subjective
improvement and started on Lasix drip.  After myocardial
infarction with his peak CK of 339, a transesophageal
echocardiogram was done showing new AS myocardial infarction
and ejection fraction of 25 to 30%.  The patient was
originally started on amiodarone as well and urine output
picked up initially.  The patient was transferred here on
Amiodarone and Lasix gtt which were discontinued and he was
changed to Levophed.  A Swan showed a cardiac index of 1.89
with an SVR of 18.  Transesophageal echocardiogram here
showed moderate to severe hypokinesis with an ejection
fraction of 30%.

Both Cardiology and Renal recommended Dopamine instead of
Levophed.  On Dopamine, his Swan showed pulmonary wedge
pressure of 30, cardiac index of 1.5, SVR of 734, read as
consistent with congestive heart failure.

Zaroxolyn and Dobutamine were added and the patient
subsequently went into atrial fibrillation.  Eventually, off
all pressors on [**11-23**] and Hydralazine and Isordil were
titrated up.  The patient was re-Swanned on [**11-27**], with an
initial pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16, but then
the next day pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 26 with
an index of 2.25.  He also had new T wave inversions and
eventually taken to catheterization on [**12-1**].  Since
catheterization, he has continued hemodialysis and diuresis
with improvement to extubation.

3.      Coronary artery disease:  The patient ruled in for
myocardial infarction at initial presentation at [**9-/2741**],
with peak CKs in the 300s.  After increasing wedge pressures
and anterior T wave inversions, he was eventually taken to
the catheterization laboratory on [**12-1**].  An 80% proximal
left anterior descending lesion was stented.  Post-cath the
patient was placed on Plavix and continued on aspirin.  Beta
blocker was held because of congestive heart failure and
Lipitor was continued.

4.      Rhythm:  The patient had eight to ten beat run of
non-specific ventricular tachycardia on [**11-21**].  The patient
developed atrial fibrillation in [**Hospital1 **] in 11/[**2740**].  The
patient back in sinus but went back into atrial fibrillation
on Dobutamine.  On the CCU Team, he was loaded on amiodarone
for atrial fibrillation and Digoxin, but has remained in
atrial fibrillation.  It was unclear prior to discharge what
the exact status or plan for cardioversion in the future will
be.  This will be addressed in an addendum discharge.

5.      Renal:  BUN/creatinine increased from baseline of 3.5
to 5.6 and urine output fell in the setting of a myocardial
infarction.  Thought sepsis/cardiogenic shock ATN.  Renal
ultrasound was also negative.  However, urine output
continued to be marginal and fluid status was positive and he
was eventually started on Ultra-filtration/hemodialysis on
[**11-21**].  Six kilograms were removed from [**11-21**] until [**11-27**],
although his urine output continued to decrease.  The patient
continued on hemodialysis throughout the length of his
hospital stay and it was presumed he would continue
hemodialysis as an outpatient.

6.      Infectious Disease:  The patient had urinary tract
infection treated with Levaquin on [**11-11**], later returned as
Pseudomonas and he was started on Ciprofloxacin/Gent and
Ceptaz.  On [**11-17**], a new right lower extremity cellulitis was
noted and he received seven days of Vancomycin.  He was
treated for a urinary tract infection with Ciprofloxacin on
[**12-2**] for three days although culture later was negative.
The patient also developed left upper lobe infiltrate with
increased white count and was started on Vancomycin on [**12-2**],
after sputum culture grew out Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.  The patient was to continue
a 14 day course to finish on [**2741-12-16**].

7.      Endocrine:  The patient ruled out for renal
insufficiency and continued on sliding scale insulin for
control of diabetes mellitus.

8.      Hematology:  Initial studies on transfer were
consistent with low-grade DIC.  Schistocytes negative on
peripheral smear and was treated with Vitamin K.  Though
initially thought to have uremic platelets causing continuous
oozing from line sites and given DDAVP.  Also transfused five
units of packed red blood cells over the course of admission
to maintain a hematocrit of approximately 27.  The patient
was given Epogen at dialysis.  The patient was attempted on
anti-coagulation for atrial fibrillation but had continued
oozing from line/venipuncture with loss of one to two packed
red blood cells.  The patient was kept off anti-coagulation
heparin and Coumadin.  The patient was put on aspirin and
Plavix post.

9.      Psychiatric:  The patient was started on Paxil for
depression.

10.     Code Status:  The patient had multiple discussions
regarding code status with patient and family.  At time of
this dictation, the patient is a full code.  This appears to
be an ongoing discussion with the family and the patient.

11.     Lines:  The patient had a right subclavian Quinton
dialysis catheter placed on [**11-28**], through which he continued
on dialysis.

12.     Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:  The patient was
started on tube feeds for nutrition.  The patient tolerated
tube feeds without side effects.  The patient began
tolerating p.o. intake on his own.  At time of dictation, the
patient was being transitioned from tube feeds to oral
feeding.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to
Rehabilitation.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   The patient is in fair condition.
The patient, however, is severely deconditioned.
