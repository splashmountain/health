   Assessment and Plan
   HYPERTENSION, BENIGN, AORTIC DISSECTION, ANXIETY
   Assessment and Plan: 81 yoF who presented to OSH with near syncope,
   fatigue, aflutter, elevated LFT's, started on coumadin. CTA chest c/w
   type B dissection. INR on admission: 2, tn I (OSH)=0.09
   Echo (OSH) : EF 60%, creat 0.6
   Neurologic: Neuro checks Q: 4 hr, Pain controlled, -somnolence this
   morning, unlikely stroke,  likely due to ambien o/n, ?baseline
   dementia, still obtaining records/PMHx--> avoid sedatives.
   Cardiovascular: -Afib/Aflutter was treated w/ coumadin at OSH --> hold
   coumadin.
   -HTN/ type aortic dissection --> hemodynamically stable on
   nitroprusside/esmolol--> keep sbp<120.
   Pulmonary: -Bilat pleural effusion, atelectasis, no consolidations by
   CT scan--> encourage cough, monitor for PNA
   -pleural effusion --> transudative vs. exudative --> unlikely
   infectious, possibly combination nutritional def + HF during rapid afib
   prior to admission.
   Gastrointestinal / Abdomen: Esophageal strictures w/ hx of dilatation
   in past--> unknown cause or w/u by records at this time -->
   videoswallow, GI consult if abnormal.
   Nutrition: NPO
   Renal: Foley, Adequate UO
   Hematology: Serial Hct, -blood loss anemia --> currently stable, no e/o
   ongoing blood loss --> hold off on tranfusion at this time--> repeat
   hct at 1pm.
   Endocrine: RISS, hyperglycemia controlled on RISS
   Infectious Disease: nl wbc, afebrile --> no e/o infection
   Lines / Tubes / Drains: Foley
