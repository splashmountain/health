Pertinent Results:
[**3036-7-21**] Carotid U/S: Bilateral calcified plaque in left and right
carotid bulbs and internal carotid arteries. The velocity
measurements demonstrate no significant stenosis in the left or
right internal carotid arteries.
[**3036-7-21**] Cardiac Cath: 1. Coronary angiography in this right
dominant system demonstrated three vessel disease. The LMCA was
heavily calcified with an ostial 70% plaque and a distal 80-90%
plaque. The LAD had a calcified plaque 80-90% at the ostium and
was otherwise small and patent. The LCX had a heavily calcified
ostial 80-90% plaque. The large ramus had an ostial 80-90%
plaque as well. The RCA an ostial 50% plaque followed by a
slightly hazy plaque proximally. 2. Resting hemodynamics
revealed an elevated LVEDP of 30 mmHg. Nitroglycerin drip was
started and lasix 20 mg IV given. Note was made of systolic
hypertension with SBP of 184. 3. Left ventriculography was
deferred. 4. An intraortic balloon pump was placed.
[**3036-7-21**] ECHO: There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=
45-50 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened
(gradient not assessed). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad.
[**3036-7-26**] Video Swallow: Penetration and aspiration with sips of
thin barium consistency.
[**3036-7-28**] CXR: Patient is status post CABG. Right vascular sheath
has been removed. There is interval improvement in bibasilar
opacities. There is a small left pleural effusion. Cardiac and
mediastinal contours are stable.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 21886**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 22**] on [**3036-7-21**] via transfer from
[**Hospital3 **] for further management of his chest pain. He
underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed severe left
main and three vessel disease. Given the severity of his
disease, an IABP was placed for cardiac perfusion. The cardiac
surgical service was consulted and Mr. [**Known patient lastname 21886**] was worked-up in
the usual preoperative manner. A carotid duplex ultrasound was
performed which showed bilateral calcified plaque in left and
right carotid bulbs and internal carotid arteries. The velocity
measurements demonstrated no significant stenosis in the left or
right internal carotid arteries. An echo was also obtained which
showed no significant valvular disease and an ejection fraction
of 45-50%. On [**3036-7-22**], Mr. [**Known patient lastname 21886**] was taken to the operating room
where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to four
vessels. Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical
intensive care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one,
his IABP was weaned and removed.

On postoperative day two, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. Thiamine and folate were given as he had a history of
moderate to heavy alcohol use. Haldol was used for episodes of
delirium. On postoperative day three, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 21886**] was transferred
to the step down unit for further recovery. He was gently
diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The physical therapy
service was consulted for assistance with his postoperative
strength and mobility. As Mr. [**Known patient lastname 21886**] was having trouble
swallowing his medications, the swallowing service was
consulted. On exam, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 21886**] was noted to have signs and
symptoms of aspiration with all consistencies. Swallowing study
showed silent aspiration and a diet of ground solids and nectar
thick liquids with no mixed consistencies was suggested.
Developed A fib and amiodarone/Coumadin started. Gram neg. rods
found in on a radial art. line culture and treated with Cipro
per ID consult. ENT consult done for vocal cord eval. and will
f/u as an outpatient. He appeared to be doing well on post-op
day eight and was discharged with the appropriate follow-up
appointments.
