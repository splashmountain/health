   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo female with severe diastolic CHF, pulm HTN, afib, ulcerative
   colitis, and recent lower GI bleed p/w acute dyspnea and hypoxia,
   hypotensive on pressors who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Patient with severe diastolic heart failure, severe
   TR admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia. She describes an acute onset which
   raises concern for an inciting event. Pt w/ leukocytosis but no fevers,
   cough, or clear consolidation suggestive of pneumonia.  Pt in chronic
   afib but rate controlled.  No CP to suggest ACS; EKG baseline and 2
   sets CE neg. PE possible but no CP, tachycardia (on beta blocker), or
   hemoptysis; she does have chronic LLE edema, now ?L>R (same leg as
   hematoma). Question component of reactive airways disease given earlier
   response to albuterol although no h/o COPD and no wheezes on exam
   currently.  Thyroid dysfunction unlikely to provoke acute
   decompensation.  Per daughter, sx may have been worsening over the past
   week already; there may be a component of suboptimal dietary/med
   compliance in this pt with baseline dCHF that has been very difficult
   to manage.
   - Repeat TTE unchanged from prior
   - Episode of chest pain on [**4-18**] resolved; EKG unchanged, troponin
   0.01->0.02
   - Ultrafiltration with careful monitoring of I/O and daily weight, with
   fluid goal -1L daily (careful to maintain pressures)
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - maintain levophed as necessary while diuresing
   - Will transition back to home spironolactone, torsemide, and
   metolazone as able
   - Nebulizers prn
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (cardiology) recs: ultrafiltration or chronic dialysis for
   volume mgt
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely cardiogenic in setting of worsening dCHF. Pt
   does have known colitis with guaiac positive stools and planned for
   outpatient scoping; stable Hct suggests that this is more a slow
   bleed.  Pt with mild leukocytosis but no evidence of sepsis at this
   time. CVL placed. UA mildly inflammatory; repeat culture pending.
   - Ciprofloxacin started [**4-17**] for empiric treatment of UTI, empiric 7
   day course
   - will maintain levophed for pressor support in setting of aggressive
   diuresis and attempt to wean as possible; goal MAP > 60
   - Monitor temp curve, WBC for now
   .
   # Hematochezia/ulcerative colitis: Recent admission for anemia; thought
   to have recurrent lower GI angioectasia bleeding.  Pt currently with
   guaiac positive dark stools but stable Hct since last discharge.
   Hematochezia most c/w LGIB again rather than UGIB. As patient has no
   increase in diarrhea, no abdominal cramping, this does not seem to be a
   UC flare.
   - Active T&S
   - Trend Hct [**Hospital1 **] for now; transfuse for Hgb > 9 per renal recs
 will
   transfuse one unit today and get post transfusion hematocrit.
   - Cont home po PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue asacol 800mg tid
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6643**] (GI) notified: agreed with continuing asacol; can call
   formal consult if needed.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: BUN 100, Cr 2.5 on admission (baseline 1.7)
   Likely decreased renal perfusion in setting of decompensated heart
   failure and hypotension. Did have ARF on last admission and was found
   to have urine eos on last admission and mesalamine initially held due
   to reports of AIN with this but restarted when stabilized; eventually
   thought more likely from prerenal azotemia.
   - FeNA = 5.8%, FeUN = 31%. Repeat FeUN 23%.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1901**] (Renal) notified and will follow while patient is in house
   - Renal recs: ultrafiltration, transfuse to keep Hgb > 9.0
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Mild AST and Alk phos elevation; nl ALT and Tbili. No
   abd pain. Likely congestive hepatopathy.
   - Trend LFTs; resolving
   - Diuresis as above
   .
   # Nausea: [**Month (only) 56**] be related to uremia.  No evidence of gastroenteritis
   currently; abd benign.
   - Zofran prn
   - Monitor for now
   .
   # Afib: Stable with slow ventricular response; not anticoagulated
   secondary to GI bleeding
   - hold metoprolol for now in setting of hypotension  and pressor
   .
   # H/o DM: Not on hypoglycemics.
   - Insulin sliding scale for now
   # Restless legs.
   -          start home gabapentin
   # LLE Abscess
 does not appear to be an abscess/cellulites, but can
   attempt to I&D today with scalpel versus needle aspirate.
