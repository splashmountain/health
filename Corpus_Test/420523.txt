Chief Complaint: 67 y/o female with ESRD s/p failed cadaveric renal on
   HD admitted with line sepsis, hypotension. Line sepsis since treated,
   developed demand ischemia with EKG changes, and abdominal pain, with
   gall bladder distension noted on CT. So the question remains what the
   source of her infection is. She has not grown organisms  from her bile
   .
   She was being treated with heparin for her SVC, with PTT in the 150s
   developed spontaneous bleeding everywhere
   24 Hour Events:
 BLOOD CULTURED - At [**3478-9-3**] 12:24 AM
   Given her normo-hypertensive BPs it was felt that she could tolerate HD
   and she had 3L taken off yesterday, maintaining MAPS in the 80s to 90s.
   Weaned off neo gtt with bp 100-250 systolic, got lopressor pm dose and
   5mg IV with effect.
   She had a trial of CPAP, was put on AC for comfort during HD, was
   agitated afterwards, receiving boluses sedation, kept on AC. Sedatives
   were changed from versed/fentanly boluses to propofol drip with plan to
   attempt wean after HD today. Continues to have copious oral
   secretions,
   Her A line was repositioned with normalizatio of her A-line tracings.
   Her biliary drain initially drained bilious then bloody fluid without
   change in her abdominal exam. She was also noted to have dark red
   blood, coffee grounds and sm clots via ogt, in setting coagulopathy
   with PTT of 150s on heparin which she was getting for SVC syndrome.
   Heparin drip was held, with reversal of her PTT to 26.7 today. Given
   coffee grounds, tube feeds held and NPH while NPO. She is on a PPI.
   She was typed, crossed, and 2 units PRBC reserved, although no
   transfusion was needed.
   Vanc dose given post HD.
   Max temp was 100. blood Cx sent x2.
