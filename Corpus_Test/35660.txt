Findings
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.

LEFT ATRIUM: Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter. Complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. Complex
(mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Trace AR.


MITRAL VALVE: Moderate/severe MVP. Eccentric MR jet. Severe (4+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Physiologic TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There
are complex (mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate/severe mitral valve
prolapse of the P2 segment. An eccentric, anteriorly directed
jet of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS: The patient is A-paced and on an infusion of
phenylephrine. The mitral valve has been repaired and an
annuloplasty band placed. There is no MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 31075**]
gradients are not significant. The aorta is intact.
Biventricular function is preserved. The Swan-Ganz catheter is
in good position. The remainder of the examination is unchanged.


Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results in the
operating room.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**3-29**] [**Known patient firstname 5700**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 367**] underwent a mitral valve repair and
coronary artery bypass grafting times three.  This procedure was
performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].  She tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred in critical but stable condition to the
surgical intensive care unit.  She was extubated and weaned from
her pressors by post operative day one.  Her chest tubes were
removed.  On post-operative day two she was nauseated and unable
to tolerate food.  She was seen in consultation by the general
surgery team for bowel distension and was asked not to eat
anything.  She underwent an aggressive bowel regimen and within
days she began to stool and her nausea abated.  She experienced
post-operative atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
response.  She was given amiodarone and she converted back to
sinus rhythm.  She was transferred to the surgical step down
floor and her epicardial wires were removed.  She experienced
diarrhea after the aggressive bowel regimen and so she stayed in
house until this problem abated.  At discharge she was weak when
she walked with physical therapy, but both the patient and her
daughter insisted that she go home rather than to rehab.
Physical therapy cleared her to go home, but she was encouraged
to be active when she returned home.
