   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN - 76 y/o M with PMHx s/f CAD, chronic systolic CHF,
   CKD, who was admitted to [**Hospital1 1246**] for CHF exacerbation but developed
   hypotension after diuresis. Now, being transferred to CCU for overnight
   monitoring.
   .
   # Hypotension
 Overdiuresis vs. infection vs. other causes.  Likely
   related to overdiuresis, as it occurred in the setting of having
   received metolazone and lasix. Furthermore, he appears dry on exam, and
   his creatinine is above baseline.  Notably, his blood pressure has been
   above 100 since arrival to the CCU.
   - continue to monitor BP
   - no additional fluid boluses at this time
   - holding diuretics
   - continue antihypertensives, with conservative holding parameters
   - treating empirically for PNA with levofloxacin
   - f/u blood cx
   .
   # Oxygen Requirement - CHF/fluid overload vs. PNA vs. some other lung
   process.  Fluid overload does not seem as likely as pt's dyspnea has
   improved with diuresis but O2 requirement remains. Of note, dry
   crackles on exam very notable, but pt does not have any orthopnea.
   Possibly, this represents interstitial lung disease.
   - CT chest ordered for today, will f/u
   - levofloxacin to empirically cover for PNA
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has known 3 vessel disease and numerous CAD risk
   factors. Patient had increase in troponins, but not in CKMB. Tn has
   since stabilized. Agree with [**Hospital1 1246**] assessment that this like likely [**12-28**]
   demand and decreased clearance from CKD.
   - Continue ASA, Plavix, Statin, beta blocker, ACE-I
   - Continue telemetry
   .
   # PUMP: EF 30% on echo from this admission. Pt received lasix and
   metolazone with good urine output initially. SOB has improved, and UOP
   has since decreased. As above, pt is likely overdiuresed at this point.
   - Cont lisinopril, Isosorbide mononitrate, nifedipine, metoprolol
   - Holding HCTZ
   .
   # RHYTHM: Atrial flutter seen on EKG. Patient has known atrial flutter
   but did not tolerate coumadin.
   - Can uptitrate beta blocker for rate control if necessary
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - Creatinine did bump above baseline
   in the setting of aggressive diuresis, likely pre-renal in the setting
   of overdiuresis.
   - can get urine lytes if Cr does not improve
   - continue to trend creatinine
   .
   # DM 2 - Per [**Hospital1 1246**] notes, pt reportedly has labile blood glucose.
   - continue regimen of [**11-27**] documented home NPH regimen
   - Humalog sliding scale
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease - Continue Pentoxifylline
