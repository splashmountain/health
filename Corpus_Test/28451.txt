Imaging Studies:
ECG Study Date of [**2931-10-16**]  4:45:36 PM
Sinus bradycardia. Prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction. No
previous
tracing available for comparison. Clinical correlation is
suggested.
.
C.CATH Study Date of [**2931-10-16**]
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
a single vessel coronary disease.  The LMCA was of normal
caliber and
had good flow.  The LAD was a culprit vessel and had a proximal
complete
thrombotic occlusion before the take off of D1 with collaterals
from the
RCA. The LCX had no angiographically apparent disease.  The RCA
was a
dominant vessel without any evidence of obstructive disease.  It
gave
collaterals to the distal LAD.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated left sided
filling
pressure with an LVEDP of 21 mm Hg.  The cardiac index was
depressed at
1.69 l/min/m2.  Central aortic systolic pressure was in the
range of 100
mm Hg.
3. Left ventriculography revealed no evidence of mitral
regurgitation.
The LVEF was depressed at 41% with anterioapical akinesis.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LAD with a 3.0
Cypher
DES with restoration of normal flow. The final angiography
showed TIMI
III flow with no evidence of dissection, embolizatio or
perforation.
(See PTCA comments)
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Thrombotic occlusion of proximal LAD.
2. Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Depressed cardiac index with central aortic normotension.
4. Mildly elevated left sided filling pressure.
5. Successful PCI of the LAD
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2931-10-17**] 7:41 AM
Heart size normal. Lungs clear. No pleural abnormality or
evidence of central adenopathy. Granulomatous calcification
noted in the left hilus and right lower paratracheal mediastinum
without appreciable lymph node enlargement.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2931-10-17**]  9:06:30 AM
Sinus rhythm. Prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Compared
to the
previous tracing of [**2931-10-16**] no diagnostic interim change.
.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2931-10-20**] 8:52 PM
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and color
Doppler son[**Name (NI) **] was performed of the right and left common
femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins. Normal
waveforms, compressibility, flow, and augmentation are
demonstrated. No intraluminal thrombus identified.
.
IMPRESSION: No DVT.
.
CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2931-10-21**] 6:11 PM
CT ABD W&W/O C; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST
1. Fatty infiltration of the liver; otherwise no evidence of
hepatic abnormality based on CT.
.
2. Soft tissue stranding seen along the extraperitoneal space
along the right iliac vessels, likely hemorrhage related to
presumed right-sided catheterization. This does not extend into
the abdomen.
.
3. Heterogeneous enhancement of the prostate and seminal
vesicles of uncertain significance--this is not a typical
appearance for tumor, and may represent
infection/abscess--please correlate clinically.
.
Transesophageal ECHO [**2931-10-23**]:
Conclusions:
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesis  of the anterior wall, septum, and apex. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of endocarditis. Regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 38 year old male with no significant cardiac risk
factors who presented with an anterior STEMI with a totally
occluded LAD s/p cypher stent.  Post-cath was complicated by
fever.
.
Cardiac:
Patient presented to OSH with 8/10 SSCP, SOB and diaphoresis.
He was found to have ST depressions v2-v5 w/ hyperdynamic T
waveforms in v2-v5 and possible ST elevations in aVR.  He was
started on heparin gtt, Integrilin gtt, NTG paste, ASA 162,
Plavix load 300mg and sent to [**Hospital1 22**] for emergent cath. LHC
showed total occlusion of LAD prior to diag, clean coronaries
otherwise w/ collaterals to LAD region.  He underwent successful
PCI with cypher stent of LAD lesion with good flow.  LV gram
revealed EF 40%, PCWP 10, CI 1.69.  CPK peaked at [**2939**].  Post
cath echo showed and EF of 40% with hypokinesis of the anterior
septum, anterior free wall, and apex.
Patient was started on a daily aspirin, Plavix, Toprol XL 25mg
PO QD, Atorvastatin 80mg PO QD and Losartan Potassium 25mg PO QD
due to ACEI cough.  Lipid panel showed 169/total, 76/trig,
43/HDL, and 111/LDL.  The patient remained chest pain free after
cath.
.
ID:
Post cath course was complicated by a fever spike to 104F.
Urine analysis was positive for a UTI with few bacteria and
21-50 WBC and the patient was started on Levaquin.  Urine was
negative for chlamydia and gonorrhea. Despite antibiotic
treatment, the patient continued to spike fevers over the next
two days and upon further questioning the patient reports having
a recent skin infection.  He is a car mechanic and developed a
pustular skin lesions with an erythematous base that began on
his left hand after he cut himself on [**2931-10-5**].  He then
developed 3 other similar lesions, one on his left arm, one on
his right arm and one on his left knee.  The patient saw his PCP
and cultures from the pustular lesions grew out MSSA.  The
patient received a 3 day course of Rocephin and a one week
course of Augmentin that he finished one day prior to current
admission.
.
Patient was started on nafcillin per ID recs.  With a presumed
history of bacteremia with staph aureus, the patient underwent a
TEE to rule out endocarditis that was negative.  CT scan showed
no liver abscess or other signs of infection and his hepatitis
panel was negative.  Liver transaminases were transiently
elevated, but this is more likely due to his recent MI than an
acute liver infection.  Abdomen/pelvis CT imaging showed
heterogeneous enhancement of the prostate and seminal vesicles
that was concerning for tumor vs. infection.  His prostate was
smooth and firm on exam without tenderness.  PSA, however, was
elevated to 23.1 which may be from his infection or from
possible prostate cancer/BPH.  The patient was discharged on a 3
week course of DS bactrim [**Hospital1 **] for prostatits, and the team spoke
with his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 21**]. [**Last Name (STitle) 13986**], who asked to see the patient in her
clinic in 3 weeks for further evaluation.
.
Patient will followup with PCP and cardiologist for [**Hospital 13987**]
medical management.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary Diagnoses:
ST-elevation myocardial infarction s/p stent to LAD on [**2931-10-16**]
Urinary tract infection
Prostatitis
Staphyloccoccus skin infection


Discharge Condition:
Stable, afebrile, ambulating independently


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for a myocardial infarction and had a stent
placed in one of the main coronary arteries that supply blood to
your heart. You were taken to the coronary care unit for close
monitoring and remained stable for 72 hours after your heart
attack. However, you developed a urinary tract infection likely
due to the foley catheter placed during your procedure and were
started on the antibiotic levoquin for a 3 day course. Despite
antibiotic treatment, you still had persistent fevers which upon
further questioning may have been due to the staphylococcus
bacterial skin infection for which you were treated with
antibiotics prior to admission. Nafcillin antibiotic was started
to treat for possible skin infection which may have seeded to
the blood and prostate. You had a echocardiogram of your heart
to evaluate for bacterial growth on valves and it was normal.
You will be discharged on a 3 week course of bactrim for
treatment of UTI and prostatitis.
.
You were placed on atorvastatin, aspirin, plavix, and metoprolol
after your heart attack. You should take plavix for at least 1
year to prevent thrombus formation around your coronary artery
stent stent.
.
Please return to the ED or call your PCP if you experience chest
pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, dizziness, worsening
of pain at your right groin catherization site.
.
Please limit your physical activities such as heavy lifting and
running for the next 6 weeks to reduce strain on your heart. You
should maintain a low salt, cardiac healthy diet, avoid smoking,
and take all your medications as prescribed.

Followup Instructions:
You have an appointment with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 171**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 169**] on [**2931-11-12**] at
3:15PM.  Please call him at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 172**] if you have any
questions or need to reschedule.
.
You have an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13988**] [**Name (STitle) 13986**] on [**2931-11-14**]
at 10:15AM.  Please call her at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 172**] if you have any
questions or need to reschedule
.
You should have a prostate serum antigen (PSA) checked in 1
month for resolution of prostate infection and also to evaluate
screening risk for cancer. Your PCP should evaluate risk for
prostate cancer given elevated PSA level and CT pelvis finding
of enlarged prostate, concerning for tumor.
.
You should have a follow up CT abdomen/pelvis in 3 weeks to
evaluate the prostate, after completing antibiotic course.
