HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 59-year-old male with
hypertension, dyslipidemia, and family history of heart
disease, who was in his usual state of health until the night
prior to admission, when he noted sudden onset of chest
pressure while at rest.  The pain did not radiate.  Was
associated with shortness of breath and nausea, but no
vomiting.  He was taken to the Urgent Care Clinic at [**Location (un) **]
at which time EKG demonstrated inferior ST elevations and the
systolic blood pressure was 80.  He was given aspirin,
started on Heparin, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] Cardiac Cath
Laboratory.

In the Cath Laboratory, he was found to have a thrombotic
occlusion of the left circumflex after OM-1, which is treated
with a 3 x 13 mm stent.  He remained hypotensive requiring
dobutamine and intra-aortic balloon pump for hemodynamic
support.  Bedside echocardiogram demonstrated ejection
fraction of 20-30%.

While in the holding area, he developed atrial fibrillation
with ventricular rates of 115 and had one episode of emesis,
which his clopidogrel was regurgitated.  Dobutamine was
subsequently weaned off.  He was transferred to the CCU in
stable condition.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Dyslipidemia.
2. Hypertension.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.2, blood
pressure 130/99, heart rate 104 irregular, satting 100% on 4
liters nasal cannula.  General:  This is an African American
male in no apparent distress.  HEENT:  Normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Oropharynx clear.  Extraocular movements are
intact.  Neck is supple, no lymphadenopathy, no bruits, and
unable to appreciate JVDs, patient lying flat.  Chest clear
anteriorly.  Heart:  Irregular, intra-aortic balloon pump,
mechanical murmurs, no rub or gallop appreciated.  Abdomen is
soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Right groin
with intra-aortic balloon pump.  Palpable pulses bilaterally
dorsalis pedis.  Neurologic:  Alert and oriented times three,
moving all four extremities, grossly intact.

LABORATORIES:  CK of 113.

EKG prior to intervention:  ST elevation in II, III, aVF with
reciprocal changes in V1 through V3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. ST elevation MI:  Patient was transferred to the CCU from
the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory on dobutamine and
intra-aortic balloon pump.  These were eventually both weaned
off, and the patient did well with a peak CK of 2577 and MB
of 336.  The patient was continued on clopidogrel, beta
blocker, ACE inhibitor, statin, and aspirin, and remained
hemodynamically stable throughout the remainder of his
hospital course.

2. Atrial fibrillation:  The patient was noted to be in
atrial fibrillation while in the holding area of the cardiac
catheterization laboratory.  The patient was rate controlled
with beta blocker and calcium-channel blocker, however, did
not spontaneously revert.  Therefore, he was taken for
electrocardioversion, which he tolerated well.  He was on
Heparin and bridged to Coumadin, and will follow up in the
Coumadin Clinic.

3. Knee effusion:  The patient developed a knee effusion
during his hospitalization.  He was without leukocytosis, and
his anticoagulation was within normal limits.  It was
therefore decided to treat this conservatively with NSAIDs,
and the patient improved.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Improved.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. ST elevation myocardial infarction.
2. Atrial fibrillation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Clopidogrel 75 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Metoprolol XL 100 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Naproxen 250 mg two tablets t.i.d. x4 days.
7. Warfarin 3 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Furosemide 20 mg p.o. q.d.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11103**]
on [**2929-10-20**] and with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in Electrophysiology
on [**2929-11-8**].
