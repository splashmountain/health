Chief Complaint:  dyspnea, cough
   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 1755**] is an 84 yo M with PMH of CVA w/residual weakness, CAD s/p
   stent, h/o COPD, h/o aspiration PNA and chronic pleural effusion/LLL
   collapse presenting with worsened dyspnea and cough over two weeks.  He
   reports that symptoms started two weeks ago with increased dyspnea and
   a "head cold" and progressed to a productive cough.  He denies any
   fevers, does endorse 8 pound weight gain and some increased leg edema.
   He has also been using his nebulizer treatments more frequently as well
   increased from QHS to TID.
   .
   Of note he was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 3779**] and treated with course
   of Vanc/Zosyn for HAP/aspiration pneumonia.  In addition, his wife was
   recently admitted with GPR bacteremia with growth of Corynebacterium
   Diptheria on [**4-28**] blood culture bottles with concern from ID consult of
   infection rather than contamination.
   .
   VS on arrival to the ED T99.4 BP 138/86 HR 84 RR 16  97% on 4L NC.  He
   had a CXR which showed stable LLL effusion with stable LLL
   consolidation.  He was given levofloxacin and flagyl to treat
   aspiration pneumonia.  While in the ED he had acute episode of
   tachycardia, likely Afib with rate in the 140's-150's with associated
   drop in blood pressure to 101/37.  He was given 500ml NS and diltiazem
   10mg IV x2, with improvement in HR to the 120's.  He was admitted to
   the ICU [**2-25**] concern for persistent tachycardia with borderline blood
   pressure.

   [**12-16**] Blood Cultures: pending
   Imaging: [**2789-12-16**] CXR: 1. Stable left basal effusion and left lower
   lobe consolidation.
   2. Atelectasis at the right lung base.
   3. Increased density and trabeculation in the right humerus is
   unchanged and most likely related to Paget's disease.

   Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are

   (PCWP>18mmHg). Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   .
   [**2789-10-23**] Chest CT:
   1. Small-to-moderate left and very tiny right pleural effusion with
   bibasilar atelectasis, more marked on the left with almost complete
   collapse of the lower lobe and scattered air bronchograms, maybe
   chronic. Similar changes are visible back to [**2786**].
   2. Emphysema.
   3. Severe Paget's disease of the thoracic spine could potentially
   restrict excursion of the diaphragm.
   4. Central bronchial wall thickening and calcifications, could be due
   to relapsing polychondritis.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 1755**] is an 84 yo M with PMH of CVA w/residual weakness, CAD s/p
   stent, h/o COPD, h/o aspiration PNA and chronic pleural effusion/LLL
   collapse presenting with worsened dyspnea and cough over two weeks,
   with new Afib w/RVR in the ED.
   .
   #Dyspnea/cough - ddx at this time includes new paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation vs viral respiratory tract infection.  Does not appear to
   have COPD exacerbation based on exam.  No current evidence for new
   pneumonia based on imaging, with normal WBC count and only low grade
   temperature although is at high risk for PNA given chronic aspiration
   and LLL collapse.  Given afib w/rvr and borderline hypotension as well
   as 8lb weight gain, this seems more likley cause for change over the
   past two weeks.
   -start po dilt and titrate for rate control
   -hold off on abx for now
   -continue home COPD reg including spiriva/atrovent/albuterol prn
   -aspiration precautions although per report pt has refused modified
   diet in the past
   -send sputum culture
   -f/u blood cultures
   -droplet precautions given wife w/Corynebacterium diptheria; touch base
   w/ID re: relevance of this to his presentation/need to r/o
   -r/o infuluenza
   -urine legionella
   .
   #Afib w/RVR - new diagnosis for him and likely cause for presenting
   symptoms.  Converted back to sinus rhythm shortly after arrival to the
   floor.
   -titrate dilt for HR control, currenlty back in sinus so may only need
   low dose
   -d/c amlodipine
   -consider anticoagulation for PAF if recurrs
   .
   #CKD - appears to be at baseline renal function with creatinine 2.1.
   -monitor creatinine
   -continue metolazone
   .
   #Type 2 DM - no acute issuse
   -monitor FSBG
   -hold glyburide for now
   -cover with insuling ss
   .
   # Hypertension - only on amlodipine as outpatient w/good bp
   control/borderline hypotension w/afib w/rvr.  He was not restarted on
   ACEI after his recent D/C
   -d/c amlodipine to allow for titration of dilt for HR control
   -continue to hold ACEI
   -diuresis w/metolazone
   .
   #Sacral Decubitus Ulcer - likely result of immobility [**2-25**] CVA, not new
   for him.
   -wound care consult in the am
   .
   #Anemia - currently stable at ~30 w/no evidence of acute bleeding.
   .
   #Urinary incontinence - continue ditropan
