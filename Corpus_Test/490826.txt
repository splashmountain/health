   Assessment and Plan
 KNOWLEDGE DEFICIT
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
 AORTIC STENOSIS
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colonic adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures  on [**3073-3-11**] who had MS
   change first noted following MRI, likely having suffered an aspiration
   event, who subsequently went into afib and flashed on the floor in the
   setting of holding her metoprolol and  Lasix.
   # Pulmonary Edema: The patient has a history of severe AS and developed
   pulmonary edema in the setting of having her diuretics held on
   admission. Also noted to have RLL collapse on CXR Overall her
   respiratory status has improved greatly since transfer to the CCU
   initially requiring humidified face mask, now on 2L NC o/n. UOP has
   been guiding diuresis, goal had been set to diurese 500cc y,d with
   Lasix gtt uptitrated from 10- 20, running mostly even, over last few
   hours has now been negative ~200cc, now responding. Continues to need
   diuresis given respiratory exam, LE edema both of which improved and
   her renal function in tolerating diuresis. Unable to obtain sputum cx
   as pt cannot clear cough.
   -Wean 02 as tolerated.
   - continue lasix drip, titrating as needed
   -continue atrovent nebs, with dextromorphan PRN cough
   -Goal UOP 500cc/day
   - repeat CXR today
   -[**Hospital1 **] lytes.
   # Possibly Aspiration PNA: Low grade fever to 100.3 on admission, now
   febrile to 101 o/n. Was pan cultured. UA showed pyuria. Currently on
   vanc/cefepime/flagyll. [**Month (only) 56**] consider adding zosyn.
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyll
   -repeat CXR
   -f/u UCx with s/s
   - trend WBC and fever curves
   -f/u blood cx.
   # Afib: Pt in Afib with RVR on arrival, in the setting of not receiving
   her metoprolol. Restarted on IV metoprolol on arrival to the CCU.  Now
   s/p transition to PO metprolol.
   -In fib with rate well controlled in 80s
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   # AS:  AS s/p valvuloplasty [**12-18**].Severe AS on Echo [**3073-3-12**].  AS known
   critical, unclear if worsened AS since [**Month (only) **] as valve area not quantified
   but known to be critical. Pt poor surgical candidate thus had not
   received AVR.
   -          consideration being given for minimally invasive
   percutaneous valve replacement once medically stable.
   -
   #  MS Change: Likely multifactorial related to benzodiazepine, ?stroke,
   respiratory status/hypercarbia on admission. Anisicoria noted on exam
   today, may be [**2-11**] recent neb treatment.
   - ASA 81mg
   -In fib with rate contro serial neuro exams.
   -f/u with neuro continued consultation.
   - keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
   - avoid benzos
   - follow resp status, serial ABGs.
   - diuresis and antibiotics as above
   - MRI when stable, per neuro recs
   # Hx Diarrhea: Hx C.diff on chronic suppression therapy with p.o
   vanc/flagyl with last cx at [**Hospital **] rehab on [**3073-2-28**] negative. At that
   time, antibiotics were continued. However diarrhea has stopped so abx
   stopped this hospitalization.
   -c.diff negative.
    can continue to monitor
   # hx GI bleed: Hematocrit stable this morning
   -          continue to trend hematocrit
   #Leg Ulcers: per wound care, ? if venous stasis vs autoimmune
   -rheum consult following ICU stabilization.
   # Nutrition: Pt now on crushed meds with apple sauce, nectar thickened
   liquids, lactose intolerant.
   -consult speech and swallow today re p.o intake now that MS improved.
