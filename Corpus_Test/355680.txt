   Assessment and Plan
   44 year old woman with DM, CAD, ESRD on HD presents with hypotension
   presumed [**3-17**] sepsis. Possible sources include line infection and
   pneumonia. Blood cultures negative. No cough or sputum. Currently on
   vanc/zosyn which we will continue. Not clinically in shock even at low
   MAP. Will monitor off of pressors today. Volume overloaded by exam and
   CXR so would
   not give additional fluid today. Plan for HD as per renal. Further
   plans as per resident note.
