   Assessment and Plan
   40F metastatic breast cancer to liver and brain, who is admitted to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] following seizures and PEA arrest.
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Likely from aspiration PNA in RLL.  Thick
   secretions. Remains on AC. Also has R sided malignant effusion. Also
   with potential constrictive physiology. Pt potentially intravascularly
   fluid overloaded.
   - Continue Ventilation (unlikely to come off vent today)
   - Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for possible HAP
   - Will attempt diuresis today
   - CXR daily
   - f/u Sputum cx
   # Seizure:  Known seizure disorder [**3-2**] brain metastases. Phenytoin
   loaded, now therapeutic level. CT head without contrast
 no acute
   process
   - Cont Phenytoin and Levetiracetam
   - Follow phenytoin levels
   - Continue dexamethasone to 8 mg [**Hospital1 **] for vasogenic edema
   # Sinus Tachycardia:  HR responsive to IVF yesterday.  Pain is
   controlled.  CTA negative for PE. Worse w respiratory distress.
   Decreased UOP  (Cr 0.6)
   - monitor on tele
   - IV fluids bolus (250cc) PRN tachycardia
   # Metastatic Breast Cancer:
   - Cont weekly Navelbine
   - Pain control with Fentanyl
   - f/I oncology, primary oncologist has had multiple discussions with
   family regarding goals of care and grim prognosis.
   - Potential family meeting. Currently family wants to continue
   aggressive care.
   # s/p PEA arrest:  S/P PEA arrest [**3378-6-2**] requiring less than 2 minutes
   of chest compressions.  Felt to be secondary to hypoxia from seizure.
   No pressors and blood pressure stable.
   - Continue tele.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Likely [**3-2**] br ca mets. Downtrending, stable.
   - cont to monitor LFTs
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: restart TFs
