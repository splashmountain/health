HOSPITAL COURSE:

The patient was admitted to the hospital for known esophageal
cancer (T3N1MO) s/p portacath placement and J-tube placement in
[**2764-3-26**], followed by neoadjuvant chemo (F5U/cisplatin) and
radiation for an esophagectomy with cervical anastomosis
([**Last Name (un) 41729**] procedure).

Postoperatively he went into acute renal failure and was seen by
the nephrology service.  He was also seen to develop loculated
pleural effusions, and so he had a pigtail placed on [**8-12**]; CXR
post placement revealed a right lung fluid in new loculated
effusion/ hydropneumothorax towards apex with the left effusion
unchanged.  THe patient then had a chest tube placed on the left
for drainage of that effusion.  When drainage had decreased
significantly and there were no signs of pneumothorax, the
patient's left and then right pigtails were removed, which he
tolerated well.

He remained on the ventilator and had a tracheostomy placed on
[**9-11**], which he tolerated well.

On [**8-25**] the patient went into septic shock and was transferred
to the CVICU.  He triggered 6x on the floor for dyspnea and
hypotension. Pressures noted to be in the 70s. Pt given albumin
for volume expansion transiently resulting in an increase in BP
into the 90s. Pt was noted to have a burst of SVT with HR in
160s which improved with carotid massage. [**12-28**] overwhelming
nursing concern, transient hypotension, concern for worsening
hypercarbia, decrease in mental status, pt transferred to ICU
for further management. Placed US guided L AC 18 gauge. Pt
intubated for hypercarbia and for fluid management concern as
latest cxr revealed volume overload versus underlying pna(no
fevers)

[**8-26**] - Pt self-extubated in AM, reintubated in CVICU, was
hypotensive, femoral a-line and RIJ triple lumen placed. Pt
taken back to OR for ~5hr exploration as to acute
decompensation, bronchoscopy unrevealing, on ex-lap multiple
loculated abscesses found and drained, JPs left in place,
anastomosis no leak. Pt hypotensive during abdominal closure -->
asystolic arrest, CPR initiated, epi/atropine given --> Vtach,
defib into sinus rhythm. Abd left open. Then had episode of SVT
during transfer from OR table to bed -Afib w/ RVR w/
hypotension, cardioverted back to sinus. Overnight in CVICU had
a slight dropoff of UOP and mild hypotension, responded to fluid
bolus. Remains sedated on fent/midaz, with slow weaning of
levophed. postop hct 33 --> Midnight Hct 30, INR 1.5, lytes wnl,
ABGs improving - last 7.54/34/110/30/+7.

[**8-27**]-off pressors, excellent urine output, transfused 1UPRBC,
continues on TPN, started on lasix gtt to augment diuresis for
possible closure, vanc trough appropriate

[**2764-8-28**]-Transfused 1 unit of PRBC's with goal of keeping patient
above goal of 30. Diuresed to goal of 100cc/hour of urinary
output with a CVP greater than 10 and an SBP > 100.

[**8-29**] - likely washout on Sunday or Monday with closure;
autodiuresis >2L, off lasix. 4am RN noticed slightly uneven
pupils and less reliable response to voice/command on neuro
check. Communicated with primary service which will decide on
course in AM as per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].

[**8-30**] washout Monday with closure; diuresis augmented with lasix
gtt and diamox, rate increased to blow off more co2, TPN
concentrated, non contrast head and chest shot, negative 3+L
over 24h

[**8-31**]-Pt to OR for attempted closure. Failed. Had Left chest tube
placed for pleural collection. 300cc's of yellow serous fluid
drained from site. Pt still not on pressors making 50-80cc's
hour.

[**9-1**] - albumin added in attempt to decrease edema, lasix bolus
to [**Male First Name (un) 2272**] albumin as neg balance reaching even. diamox d/c'ed.

[**9-2**] lasix boluses d/c'ed in favor of lasix gtt, [**State **] patch
tightened, IR/CT guided drainage deferred to tomorrow AM,
vivonex 20cc/hr to be held at midnight started.

[**9-3**] - stool for guaiac, search for source of anemia. For IP
drainage of right apical effusion today, if drainage successful
chest tube to be d/c'ed by thoracic.
[**9-4**]- maintained negative, R chest tube removed by thoracic
surgery
[**9-5**] - Continue to make 1/2L negative, follow BUN/Cr, daily CXR
[**9-6**]-started vanc--goals remain similar as yesteday.
[**9-7**] - TPN reordered, lasix gtt to continue per thoracic,
titrate to goal 0-1L negative. CVL displaced in PM, new RIJ CVL
placed. Also noted to be jaundiced - LFTs elevated, TB 4.7,
AST/ALT in 80s, primary team requests to repeat LFTs in AM.
Post-line CXR - small line near left heart border, rads resident
read as possible pneumomediastinum, again line on repeat CXR.
Possible pneumomediastinum unlikely related to line placement,
pt w/ esophagectomy, ?air tracking from open abdomen or surgical
site, pt remain hemodynamically stable overnight. Discussed with
primary team, agree to plan to monitor and manage conservatively
until repeat CXR in AM or further plan by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3817**]. Plan for OR
[**9-8**] for possible abdominal closure.
[**9-8**]: Unable to take back to OR, will go back [**9-9**] for closure
of negative pressure therapy, d/c'ed versed gtt in favor of
intermittent ativan with minimal requirement of usage, TF off
after MN/NPO p MN for OR [**9-9**].
[**9-9**] Went back to OR today, DC left chest tubes, dc both JP
drains, DC ng tube, placed bovine pericarial matrix on superior
portion of wound, and closed the infraumbilical portion.
Attached vac dressing to superior portion. For vac change on the
18th. Consideration of add on for trach on Friday. Want to
continue vanc, zosyn, fluconazole for a few more days. Goal for
euvolemia. Per nursing, pt was tried on CPAP which was not
tolerated. Fentanyl was weaned from 200 to 150.
[**9-10**] TF advanced w/ TPN x 1 more day. PICC attempted on R arm
at bedside but unable, IR order placed, will need bicarb to be
written at time of procedure. No OR cultures to follow. No
change in vent setting (kept on CMV) as NPO for trach in AM.
[**9-11**] trach'ed, picc line in place, vac changed in OR, sedation
weaned, resp weaning as much as possible
[**9-12**] - On [**9-12**] the patient was noted to be febrile to 103 -
though with a stable blood pressure, and he was pancultured for
concern with sepsis.  On [**9-13**] the patient was noted to have
copious amount of frank green thick feces emanating from his vac
dressing.  He underwent takedown of the vac dressing and the
pericardial mesh with opening of the skin closure on [**9-13**] at
the bedside.  He was found to have a colocutaneous fistula, from
which was emanating the stool.  That day he underwent a CT
abd/chest with contrast that revealed leakage of contrast to
anterior abdomen from transverse colon; no biliary  dilatation
or gallbladder distension.
[**9-13**] - Kept on amp/zosyn/fluconazle per thoracic (vanco denied
by ID). CT C/A/P w/ small perf transverse colon to anterior
abdomen, kept NPO, TPN restarted. HIDA scan ordered per
thoracic. Left radial a-line placed.
[**9-14**] - no HIDA scan, ostomy nurse creates large vacuum sump for
EC fistula, 2UPRBC xfused, TPN continues, no tube study
necessary for EC fistula as prior contrast passes distal to the
fistula, currently on only Zosyn - added Vanco due to new
culture data from cath tip
[**9-15**] - Pt taken by IR for placement of cholecystostomy tube. Pt
off pressors, making good urine with no other O/N issues.
[**9-16**] - Bactrim started for stenotrophomonas. Lasix gtt started
for diuresis.
[**9-17**] - ID consulted, [**Last Name (un) 1117**] caspo bactrim started,
hemodynamically stable so far, weaned of versed gtt with
intermittent ativan used for sedation, daily cultures to be
obtained with sputum per ID
[**9-19**] - tolerating PS (PS18/PEEP5/50%) x 12 hours overnight.
[**9-20**] - became intolerant of CPAP+PS placed back on the vent,
spiked to 102 pan cultured, lasix gtt restarted with goal
-500/-1L negative, CXR in am to be obtained, nutrition labs
obtained, OT consulted, abx continue
[**9-21**]: DC vanco, DC [**Last Name (un) 1117**], started vivonex tube feeds for
nutrition; Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] wants daily plan update emailed to him from
team. SP family meeting yesterday. O/N patient had BUN/Creat
ration of 35/1. He was producing 20cc's hour of urine. Given
albumin with hope of mobilizing extravascular fluid(albumin
2.0). Started patient on methadone 20 Q 8 and PO valium 10 Q 6.
DC fentanyl and versed drip. Wrote for PRN fentanyl/versed.
[**9-22**]: vent regimen to PS20 (from PS25) 2-3x/day for diaphragm
exercise. Cr to 1.2 today - hold lasix gtt; good uop. Bowel
regimen started (MoM, colace, dulcolax), enema next; received 2
units PRBC; restarted lasix gtt at low dose in PM for net pos 3
L --> aim for euvolemia.
[**9-23**] : Continued to tolerate PS20 throughout the day and night;
lasix gtt held [**12-28**] to reduced effect and rising BUN/Cr over the
course of the day; speciation of sputum culture from [**9-18**] shows
bactrim resistance -> tobramycin added
[**9-24**] - tobra d/c'ed, increasing cr, lasix gtt d/c'ed. o/n high
peak pressures (PIP 40s, plateau 30s), severe resp acidosis +
metab acidosis, anuria/oliguria, back to pressure controlled
ventilation
10/31 - hypothermic x 2 (both axillary temps), bedside echo
adequate intravascular filling with nl contractility; bronch for
elevated airway pressures, no plugs, minimal thin secretions,
BAL sent; left IJ placed w/ SvO2 monitoring, SvO2 80s. Remains
oliguric. Bicarb 2 amps x 2. Renal consulted - ATN w/ granular
non-muddy cast, monitor, CVVH/HD if needed.   Concern for ARDS,
ARF.
[**9-26**] - [**9-28**] - off caspo, tobramycin d'c'd.  Reamined on pressure
support ventilation, poor tidal volumes.  Unable to wean off
vent - increasing acidemia with HCO3 to low of 15.
[**9-29**]  The patient's creatinine increased to 3.6 and he failed to
respond to 200 IV lasix. He required increasing sedation to
fentanyl 400/hr.  The patient also underwent a gastrograffin
study that revealed free flow of contrast from the rectum to the
distal transverse colon with drainage into the anterior
abdominal wound via colocutaneous fistula without evidence for
an obstructing lesion in the left colon.
[**9-30**]  The patient's acute renal failure worsened to a creatinine
of 3.9 with clonus on exam and concern for uremic encephalopathy
as per the renal fellow.  He was started on CVVH.  The output
from his NGT was concerning for possible stool.  His antibiotics
were continued. He remained on PCV ventilation but became
hypocapnic but also with a low bicarb.
[**10-1**]- [**10-2**] Bilirubin up to 14.7, becoming more jaundiced; had
RUQ U/S and evaluation of perc choly tube that was negative for
cholecystitis or infection or abnormality of the biliary tract.
On half dose tube feeds with fat free TPN.  Feces out of
abdominal fistula.  Creatinine decreasing to 2.7 on CVVH.
Changed from PCV to AC. Pt suffering from ARDS, ARF, hepatic
failure.
[**10-3**] - CVVH continued with 1.5L of fluid removed. Open abdomen
developed small but persistent area of bleeding lateral and
slightly superior to the fistula. Hemostasis was achieved
through application of Surgicell.
[**10-4**] - patient remained on CVVH with goal net negative 2L.
Dressing changes continued.  Sedation decreased slightly from
300 fentanyl to 200 fentanyl.
[**10-7**] - VAC dressing applied to abdominal wound by general
surgery service
[**10-8**] - atrial flutter, low blood pressure. failed attempted
cardioversion at 50, 100 and 200J. started on neo gtt,
continuing sedation. placed on amio gtt per cardiology rec. TF
stopped prior, now progressing to full TPN.
[**10-9**]: CT torso - no changes/new acute issues very hypotensive,
tachycardic overnight, was in A flutter, cardioversion x 2.
CVVHDF running
[**10-12**]: AFlutter cardioverted, started on amio again, changed
pressors from neo to levophed and vasopressin.  Remains in NSR.

Family meeting on [**10-12**], no escalation of care, but full code
currently. LFTs continuing to rise.
Patient continued on pressors, tpn, amiodarone for afib, stable
ventilartory setting but continued to have rising liver finction
tests and required increased doses of pressors so that he also
had a very positive fluid balance for a few days in a row. There
were continued daily family discussions during this time. ON
[**10-16**] the family
decided that it was time to make the patient CMO. care was
withdrawn with multiple family memebers present and he expired
just before 6pm on [**2764-10-16**]. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] was present during the
family meetings and was notified of his passage. The family
declined an autopsy.
