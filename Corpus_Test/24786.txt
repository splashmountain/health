Elective cardiac surgery

[**3366-12-2**] Left Ventricular Myomectomy


History of Present Illness:
This is a 61 year old female with known HOCM since [**3359**]. Her
original operation was delayed as preoperative evaluation was
notable for pulmonary nodules. CT scan at that time showed a 9
millimeter nodule in the right middle lobe and multiple,
small(less than 5 millimeters) noncalcified pulmonary nodules.
Subsequent PET scan showed no FDG avidity in the pulmonary
nodule in the right middle lobe. There were multifocal
asymmetric pulmonary opacities, which are FDG-avid and
concerning for multifocal pneumonia. Findings were otherwise
unremarkable. She now returns for cardiac surgical intervention.

Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with mitral
regurgitation, Congestive Heart Failure, Chronic Atrial
fibrillation, Hypertension, Osteoarthritis, History of
Pneumonia, Pulmonary Nodules, Depression, s/p Breast Biopsy

[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1766**]ospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] was admitted and underwent routine preoperative
evaluation. She remained stable on medical therapy and was
started on intravenous Heparin for her chronic atrial
fibrillation. Workup was unremarkable and she was cleared for
surgery. On [**12-2**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 141**] performed a left
ventricular myomectomy. Following the operation, she was brought
to the CSRU on inotropic support. Within 24 hours, she awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. It took several days
for her to wean from Neo-Synephrine. Her hemodynamics gradually
stabilized. She continued to experience atrial fibrillation with
periods of normal sinus rhythm, and was intermittently
transfused to maintain hematocrit near 30%. Her platelet count
drop as low as 39K on POD#3. HIT assays were checked, returning
negative. Her clinical status stabilized and she transferred to
the SDU on POD#4. She continued to experience atrial
fibrillation with periods of rapid ventricular rate. She was
eventually started on Amiodarone while low dose beta blockade
was resumed for rate control. Warfarin anticoagulation was also
resumed. Heparin was temporarily required for a sub therapeutic
prothrombin time. Over the remainder of her stay, medical
therapy was optimized and she was intermittently transfused to
maintain hematocrit near 30%. Norvasc and Diovan were
discontinued due to periods of hypotension. Beta blockade was
slowly advanced as tolerated. She remained in atrial
fibrillation. She was fluid overloaded and required aggressive
diuresis with intravenous Lasix. By discharge, she was
approaching her preoperative weight with room air saturations of
94%. Her lower extremity edema improved. Chest x-ray prior to
discharge was notable for only small bilateral pleural
effusions. A short course of Macrobid was given for a urinary
tract infection. She otherwise continued to make clinical
improvements and made steady progress with physical therapy.
Levofloxacin was started for mild erythema on the inferior
aspect of her sternotomy. Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] was eventually cleared for
discharge to home on postoperative day twenty one. She will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], her cardiologist and her primary
care physician as an outpatient. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 28345**] and [**Doctor Last Name 1769**] at
[**Hospital **] Medical Group will be following her Coumadin dosing
for a target INR of 2.0-3.0.
