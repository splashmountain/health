Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1224**]
Chief Complaint:
epigastric/back pain, and nausea/vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with bare metal stent to the diagonal
artery


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 54 yo F with HIV and Bipolar Disorder who
presented to the [**Hospital1 4**] ED with epigastric/back pain, and
nausea/vomiting.
.
The pt states she initially had N/V yesterday around 11 am. She
continued to have nausea into today, but then at 2 pm she
started to get severe [**11-10**] pain that felt like it would
"explode" in her back which radiated to her epigastrium. She
tried a lidocaine patch, percocet, and icy hot, but none of that
helped. The pain started to radiate to her jaw and neck.
Associated with the pain, the pt states she had tightness with
her breathing and diaphoresis.
Her vitals in the ED upon arrival were: T
After she arrived, she was found to have concerning changes on
EKG (ST elevations in V5 and V6 with reciprocal changes in the
inferior leads (II, III, avF) for a STEMI. The ED started a
heparin drip, integrillin, ASA 325 mg PO, and 5 mg of IV
metoprolol x 1. She was loaded with 600 mg of plavix, and was
sent to the cath lab.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.

Cardiac catheterization [**3478-8-4**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated
single and branch vessel CAD. The LMCA was patent. The LAD had a
distal
tubular 70% stenosis. There was a thrombotic total occlusion in
a large
proximal first diagonal branch with few collaterals from the
RCA. The
LCx was small without obstructive disease. The RCA had minimal
disease.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided
filling
pressures with an LVEDP of 32 mmHg. There was mild systemic
arterial
systolic hypertension with an SBP of 140 mmHg.
3. There was no pressure gradient on left heart pullback from
left
ventricle to ascending aorta to suggest aortic stenosis.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of D1 with a 2.5x23 mm Mini
Vision bare
metal stent which was postdilated with a 2.5x20mm NC quantum
balloon.
5. Successful closure of right femoral arteriotomy with 6F
angioseal.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single and branch vessel CAD with STEMI due to D1 occlusion.
2. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. Successful PCI of D1 with bare metal stent.
4. Successful deployment of 6F angioseal at right femoral
arteriotomy.
.
ECHO [**3478-8-6**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with mid anterior/anterolateral hypokinesis. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
ECG [**3478-8-8**]:
Sinus rhythm. There is an early transition which is
non-specific. Compared to the previous tracing there is no
signifciant change.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
54yoF with h/o HIV, fibromyalgia/spinal scoliosis and chronic
pain who presented today to the [**Hospital1 4**] ED with a cc of nausea and
vomiting. She was found to have + cardiac enzymes in the ED with
ST elevations on EKG and is now s/p cardiac catheterization.
.
# STEMI/CAD: Pt with no previous CAD hx presents with STEMI now
s/p cath. The pt was Plavix loaded with 300 mg, was given ASA
325 mg, as well as a high dose statin, metoprolol 5 mg IV x 1,
SLNTG, Integrillin. ASA 325 mg po daily and Plavix 75 mg po
daily were continued throughout admission. Atorvastatin was
decreased to 40 mg po QHS as HAART affects the cytP450 that
metabolizes statins. She had an episode of CP responsive to SLNG
and morphine after cath. She also had chest pain that varied
with position and inpiration that responded to indomethacin;
however, no pericardial effusion noted on Echo. She was started
on metoprolol tartrate 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], which was titrated up to 25mg
[**Hospital1 **], and she was discharged on 50mg of metoprolol succinate.
However, while she was bale to tolerate BBlockade well, her
SBPs, which were in the 90s, did not tolerate addition of an
ACEi. Pt developed a small inguinal hematoma after cath. Hct was
closely followed. She received 1 unit pRBCs after which her
Hct/Hgb bumped appropriately and was stable throughout the rest
of admission.
.
# PUMP: Pt has no prior Dx of CHF. Echo showed EF 45-50% and
mild regional LV systolic dysfunction. BBlocker started as noted
above. ACEi held as noted above.
.
# RHYTHM: Pt monitored on tele throughout hospital stay. No
arrhythmia noted.
.
# HIV: Home HAART regimen continued throughout admission:
Lopinavir-Ritonavir 200-50 mg [**Hospital1 **] and Emtricitabine-Tenofovir
200-300 mg daily. Last known CD4 is 488 from [**3477-7-2**].
Atorvastatin dose adjusted as noted above.
.
# Gastric Ulcers: Pt is on omeprazole at home. Pt was initially
started on pantoprazole 40 mg IV BID for now. She was switched
to po ranitidine given the potential interaction between Plavix
and PPIs.
.
# Bipolar Disorder: Home sertraline and bupropion continued
throughout admission.

Discharge Instructions:
You had a heart attack and needed a cardiac catheterization and
a bare metal stent to open a clogged artery. It is extremely
important that you take Plavix every day for at least one month
to prevent the stent from clotting off and causing another heart
attack. You will take 2 tablets of Plavix every day for one
week, then decrease to one tablet daily. Do not stop taking
Plavix unless Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 840**] tells you to, even if you have bleeding.
You will also need to be on the following medicines to help your
heart recover from the heart attack. These medicines are:
1. Aspirin, enteric coated, 325 mg daily to take with the
Plavix. Do not stop taking this medicine unless Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 840**] tells
you it is OK.
2. Metoprolol to slow your heart rate and help your heart
recover
3. Atorvastatin to help prevent further blockages in your
arteries. You will need to have liver function tests in 6 weeks
and every 6 months to make sure it is not affecting your liver.
4. Plavix: as noted above
5. Nitroglycerin tablets to take under your tongue if your chest
pain that brought you to the hospital returns. Sit down, take
one tablet under your tongue and wait 5 minutes. If you still
have chest pain you can take one more tablet but pls call 911 so
you can get to the hospital.
6. Stop taking Omeprazole, it interferes with Plavix.
.
You will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 840**] in 5 weeks and will probably have a
stress test to see if the other blocked heart artery needs to be
fixed as well. You should continue taking your other medicines
as before.
