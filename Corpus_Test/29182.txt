Results:
CXR [**3017-10-17**]:
1. Persistent moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion with
compression atelectasis. Underlying consolidation cannot be
excluded.
2. No evidence of fluid overload.
.
LE U/S [**3017-10-18**]:
Occlusive left-sided DVT involving the left common femoral,
superficial femoral and popliteal veins. Non-occlusive thrombus
seen within the right common femoral vein, in the region of the
junction with the greater saphenous vein.
.
CTA chest [**3017-10-18**]:
1. Non-occlusive pulmonary embolus within the right upper lobe
pulmonary artery, without associated findings to suggest
infarct. .
2. Small left and moderate right pleural effusions.
3. 2-mm right upper lobe pulmonary nodule, for which no
additional followup is required in a patient without a history
of malignancy or increased risk for lung cancer.
4. Anasarca.
5. Ascending thoracic aorta diameter at upper limits of normal
at 4 cm.
.
MRI/A Brain w/o contrast [**3017-10-19**]
Limited examination secondary to motion artifact, however there
is evidence of vascular signal in both internal carotids as well
as the
vertebrobasilar system, the distal branches are not completely
visualized likely secondary to motion artifact and combination
of atherosclerotic disease in the distal vascular branches.
.
Abdominal U/s complete [**3017-10-21**]
1.  Markedly improved appearance in gallbladder wall edema from
prior study of [**12-18**].
2.  Interval development of fatty infiltration of the liver.
Other forms of diffuse liver disease including cirrhosis,
fibrosis, and possible long-term steroid use can result in this
appearance.
3.  Echogenic, atrophic kidneys.
4.  Large right pleural effusion.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**3017-10-30**]
1.  No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
2.  Stable left renal hypodensity, which is too small to further
characterize but likely a cyst.
3.  Moderate right and small left pleural effusions which
measure simple fluid density.  No evidence of pneumonia.
.
U/s RUE venous ultrasound [**3017-11-4**]
Duplex and color Doppler demonstrate no right upper extremity
DVT.
Note of an occluded AV fistula within the right antecubital
fossa.

Brief Hospital Course:
66F h/o SLE, ESRD on HD, PVD, chronic atypical chest pain, and
CVA, recently worked up for tachypnea and electrolyte
abnormalities, admitted for tachypnea, and found to have PE/DVTs
and coagulopathy.
.
# Hypoglycemia: During her inpatient stay she has had
hypoglycemia in 20s and 40s. Hypoglycemia is likely
multifactorial due to ESRD, s/p gatrectomy, and possible
cirrhosis due to hx of ETOH abuse and poor oral intake.
Insulinoma, although unlikely, was ruled out with normal insulin
levels.  Patient was also treated with TPN and her hypoglycemia
subsequently improved.  TPN was discontinued on [**3017-11-3**] with
the placement of a post-pyloric NGT for continued feeding.  She
additionally has had an increased appetite the last several days
with the addtion of Megace.  No hypoglycemic events for some
time prior to discharge.  Thus, will discharge on continued tube
feeding and a regular diet with continued nutrition evaluation
via qweek albumen levels.  Does not need fingersticks at this
time, but would recommend checking one if patient becomes
lethargic or somnolent for unclear reason.
.
# Tachypnea/Respiratory alkalosis: The patient was admitted for
episodes of tachypnea, which was also the cause of a recent
admission from which the patient had been recently discharged
and worked up for possible etiologies. During her previous
hospitalization, it was believed that her tachypnea was most
likely of central origin, but a head CT did not reveal a cause.
When the patient was admitted, her respiratory rate reached 30,
and an ABG demonstrated a pH of 7.67 with pCO2 of 12, a pO2 of
114 on oxygen by NC and a bicarb of 14. The patient's
respiratory rate decreased when the patient was sleeping an a
repeat ABG demonstrated pH 7.39 pCO2 34 pO2 160 HCO3 21. As
anxiety was thought to be contributing to the patient's
tachypnea, the patient was given ativan, and the respiratory
rate remained normal during the remainder of her
hospitalization. The patient's ativan dose was decreased to PRN
as the patient became somnolent when taking the medication on a
regular schedule. During the course of the patient's
hospitalization, a head MRI/MRA and a repeat CT head did not
suggest any other etiologies for the patient's repeated
tachypnea. The patient was found to have a small PE (see below),
which may have contributed to the initial tachypnea, but as the
patient's O2 sats and HR were normal it was unclear why
tachypnea caused by the PE would resolve with sleep.  Neuro
suggested to consider long term EEG study to evaluate for
central cause of tachypnea if further workup was wanted that
revealed encephalopathy.  Tachypnea may be related to anxiety.
Evidence in support of this is that the patient becomes less
tachypneic when asked to breath slowly.  She was treated
symptomatically with benzos at low dose prn for anxiety to
prevent severe respiratory alkalosis from tachypnea.  Her
electrolytes were additionally monitored on a daily to twice
daily frequency without progression of her alkalosis.  On
discharge will send with lorazepam low dose PRN.  We
additionally started her on Megace as an appetite stimulant but
would recommend discontinuing this if her respiratory alkalosis
worsens.
.
# Coagulopathy: The patient was admitted with an INR of 6.2, PT
of 51.9 and a PTT of 50.5. She has a history of coumadin use,
but her coumadin was reportedly discontinued during a
hospitalization [**3017-9-5**] for a chronic (>8month) septic
thrombophlebitis of the left IJ vein, although it was restarted
briefly during the patient's previous hospitalization in
[**3017-10-9**].  The patient had a RUQ ultrasound that demonstrated new
fatty infiltration of the liver. DIC labs did not show any
evidence for DIC. Heme-onc was consulted and believed that the
patient's coagulopathy could have been the result of the
treatment with coumadin given during the patient's previous
hospitalization, vancomycin dosing, nutritional deficiency (see
below) or liver failure. Thus, coumadin was held until patient
was therapeutic and was ultimately restarted prior to discharge.
 No etiology mixed with coumadin in the setting of vancomycin
and poor diet, with possible mild synthetic dysfunction of her
liver.
.
# PE/DVT: The patient was found to have an enlarged left leg on
admission. Ultrasound of the lower extremities revealed clots in
both the left and the right leg and a CT chest revealed a PE.
Because the patient's INR was already supratherapeutic (see
above) treatment was not initiated, and the patient's tachypnea
resolved spontaneously.  INR supratherapeutic, although clots
developed in setting of supratherapeutic INR.  Anti-coagulation
will be an issue given HIT.  Heme-onc is following, will follow
recs as to anticoagulation when INR decreases.  Heme/Onc agrees
with the possibility of an IVC filter given failure with
therapeutic INR.  Pt received single-lumen midline for IV
access; IR also placed an IVC filter. Current hematology
recommendations for anticoagulation is low dose heparin 1mg
Qday.  Goal INR [**2-15**].  Started on low dose coumadin with
titration per facility protocol.
.
# Nutritional deficiency: The patient was found to have an
albumin of 1.3. Nutrition was consulted and recommended
supplementation that was added to the patient's diet. The
patient was maintained on a normal diet and her diet was
supplemented with thiamine. At the time of transfer, the patient
and family agreed a feeding tube is needed and appropriate
consultation is requried. Patient was evaluated by surgery, who
felt she was a poor surgical candidate due to her nutritional
status.  It was recommended that she get a post-pyloric NGT
placed and that surgery be considered when albumin was greater
than 2.  Thus, IR placed a feeding tube on [**3017-11-3**] and
tubefeeding was started per Nutrition recs.  She should
continued to have her albumen monitored weekly while at rehab
and bring this information to her follow-up surgical appointment
in approximately 3 weeks to determine if a PEG is needed & if
she would heal properly.  She should additionally continue a
regular renal diet and Megace.  If she takes adequate oral
intake and meets a caloric goal of 1800 calories/day, would
consider removing feeding tube sooner than at scheduled
follow-up appointments.
.
# Hypophosphatemia: In the setting her of respiratory alkalosis,
hypophosphatemia is likely due to transcellular shift.  However,
phos improved with TPN.  Original concern was that she may not
be absorbing neutraphos from gut. Thus, she was continued on
phosphate supplementation with holding parameters.  Will be
discharged to rehab with daily eletrolyte checks given concern
for refeeding syndrome with continued nuetraphos with holding
parameters.
.
# Anemia: Baseline hematocrit is 21-26. Hct on admission 20. Hct
stable post 2U transfusion on [**10-29**].  Anemia studies suggest
anemia of chronic disease plus element of hemolysis.  Unclear
why patient would be hemolyzing.  Hct was slowly decreasing
towards discharge, likely related to both continued blood draws
and poor production [**2-14**] ESRD.  In the past has been fairly Epo
resistant.  Followed by Renal throughout inpatient stay who
suggested reinitiating epo at 10-15kU/rx so she does not become
transfusion dependent.  The day of discharge iron studies were
again checked and remained consistent with anemia of chronic
disease with decrease iron and TIBC and elevated ferritin.  Will
discharge with epo as suggested by Renal.  Should continue with
TIweek HD and Hct monitoring at those sessions.  Would transfuse
for Hct < 21.

.
# DVT in left brachial vein and subclavian vein & PE: Per last
DC summary, a LUE U/S showed a subclavian and brachial DVT that
possibly extends to the IJ. As there was evidence of clot as far
back as [**3016**] (on a neck CT), it was felt that it did not need to
be treated.  Patient has history of HIT, so is on coumadin for
PE.  Started on low dose as described above.
.
# Hyponatremia: The patient was hyponatremic on admission, she
was given IL NS and her hyponatremia resolved. Her electrolytes
were monitored during the hospitalization but she had no futher
sodium abnormalities.
.
# Renal failure:  She has known chronic renal failure secondary
to SLE, on HD M/W/F.  She was continued on hemodialysis while
inpatient and followed by the renal team.  Initially thought to
be epo resistant, she was not continued on this - especially
given concern for SLE related thrombophilia.  Given risk for
transfusion-dependence, she was restarted on epo with her
continued coumadin dosing.
.
# FEN: Regular diet with tubefeeding supplementation.
Tubefeedins is Nutren Pulmonary per Nutrition.  Note, her
tubefeeding doesn't need to be on Nutren Renal given that she is
an HD pt and gets extra electrolytes dialyzed off.
