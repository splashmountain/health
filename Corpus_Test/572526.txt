   Assessment and Plan
   85M w chronic systolic CHF (EF 30%), atrial fibrillation w RVR, aortic
   stenosis ([**Location (un) **] 0.8-1.0 cm2), HTN, Burkitt's lymphoma, who presented with
   altered mental status and dehydration, was transferred to CCU with low
   urine output, rising lactate, recent afib with RVR.
   # AMS: Similar to AMS on last admission, likely from delirium secondary
   to pneumonia. Slowly improving.
   - continue to limit sedating medications, limit restraints, remove
   Foley when possible
   - continue levofloxacin
   # RHYTHM: Atrial fibrillation
 Sligtly better rate control after the
   addition of diltiazem to metoprolol.
   - continue diltiazem/metoprolol
   - hold warfarin per PCP for fall risk, will continue aspirin 325 mg
   daily
   .
   # PUMP: Chronic systolic heart failure, EF 30% on [**2883-12-21**]. Low urine
   output yesterday.
   - 1L of NS today
   - monitor I/O closely
   - continue metoprolol
   .
   # VALVES: Aortic stenosis - the patient
s aortic valve area of approx
   0.9cm2.  [**Month (only) 56**] be worsened overall status secondary to natural history of
   worsening of AS.
   - might consider valvuloplasty in the future, after this admission, if
   needed for symptomatic relief; not ideal AVR candidate
   .
   # PNA: CXR ([**1-5**]) w ?RLL consolidation. Treated w Zosyn at first, given
   that pt is from nursing home. Transitioned to levofloxacin PO.
   Currently O2 Sats excellent on 2L.
   - levofloxacin PO day 3 of 7 day course through [**2884-1-14**]; redose given
   improving renal function
   - f/u blood cx
 NGTD
   - wean supplemental O2 as tolerated
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  After improving for several days,
   yesterday UOP was down and creatinine bumped.  Likely again prerenal in
   part from poor perfusion given severe heart disease.  UOP improved with
   IVF.  History of CKD with baseline creatinine in ~1.5.
   - renally dose all meds
   - 1 L NS today
   .
   # ELEVATED LFTs:  Likely [**1-24**] poor perfusion (dehydration, aortic
   stenosis, ?cardiogenic shock). Unrevealing hepatitis and autoimmune
   workup during last admission.  Transaminitis resolving, but alk phos
   continues to increase, likely reflecting hepatic congestion.
   - trend LFTs
   - consult hepatology
   .
   # Elevated INR: INR 2.6 on admission, up from 1.3 at discharge on
   [**2883-12-28**]. Also elevated during last admission even though patient was not
   on warfarin. Again, likely from transient liver failure and
   malnutrition. No sign of active bleeding. Downtrending to 1.9 today.
   - trend coags
   .
   # RUE edema: stopped IV antibiotics.
   -PICC only for labs
   -elevate right arm
   .
   # HTN: Currently BP is stable.
   - continue metoprolol, diltiazem
   .
   # OSA: Not candidate for theophylline as uncontrolled AF.
   - CPAP at night as tolerated
   .
   # FEN: Regular low-sodium cardiac diet
   .
   # Access: PICC for labs only, PIV
   .
   # PPx:
   -DVT ppx with SQ Heparin
   -Bowel regimen
   .
   # Code: FULL CODE  for now; ongoing discussion regarding changing code
   to DNR/DNI
   .
   # Dispo: CCU care for now
   .
   # Contact: HCP: [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 7360**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 2491**]. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7361**]; Son [**Name (NI) 372**]

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   per housestaff
   Physical Examination
   per [**Hospital 4449**]
   Medical Decision Making
   per housestaff
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   new issue is rising alkaline phosphatase - will ask hepatology to
   informally consult
   atrial fibrillation is better controlled
   hydrate with close attention to urine output
   Creatinine is no normalizing
