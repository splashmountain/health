   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 76 y o man with several month history of refractory C.diff
   presented with septic shock [**12-21**] C.diff colitis now improving.
   #Hypotension / low urine output / volume overload:  Currently
   normotensive with low urine output.  Put . Pitting edema, and rapid
   pulmonary edema 2 days ago suggest need for cautious hydration and CVP
   support
   -pressors weaned off over night
   -cautious fluid boluses of 250cc for hypotension, reassess throughout
   day
   -small free water flushes w/ tube feeds for borderline hypernatremia
   - trend sodium w/ pm lytes, if start to rise again, consider 500cc-1L
   IV free water
   - p.m. lytes
   # Leukocytosis: Improving somewhat today w/ stable hematocrit.
   Clinically does not appear to be infected above and beyond his C.diff.
   Appears to be improving. No rash or fever to indicate drug reaction, no
   increase in Eos. Abd exam benign, diarrhea slowly resolving, no other
   obvious source. Considered pericarditis, but no evidence on ECHO.  No
   UTI. Most likely still [**12-21**] colonic inflammation from colitis.
   -follow CXRs for signs of evolving PNA
   -trend WBC
   -resend sputum cx if possible
   # C.diff.  Septic shock resolving.  Abdominal exam benign and diarrhea
   continues but is less.
   - continue PO Vanc/IV flagyl for 14 days
   - follow GI recs
   - Follow blood cultures
   - Per GI recs gave IV IG therapy for C-diff last night, tolerated well.
   # A Fib with RVR.  CEs flat. Had second episode [**8-13**], converted after
   amiodarone, diltiazem, and digoxin. Continued on IV amiodarone and
   digoxin,.
   - monitor
   - continue 400mg PO BID x 1 week.
   - Digoxin, per pharmacy recs, will continue w/ 0.125mg PO every other
   day, will follow levels.  Check next level tomorrow.
   # Myocardial Ischemia: On presentation had elevated ST segments in
   setting of clean coronaries per cath report c/w demand ischemia.  Such
   diffuse elevation would also be consistent with pericarditis.
   Echocardiogram showed no evidence of restrictive heart disease.
   Troponins are reassuring. Had repeat ECHO with no increase in effusion
   or signs of pericarditis. Pt has had no chest pain at any point.
   - Continue Statin at 40 mg
   - ASA 81 mg
   # Parkinson
   - Continue Senemet 25-100 TID  (needs diet)
   # Sacral decub
 Currently very mild per nursing.
   - dressed by wound care, will change q3days, no erythema currently,
   monitor, frequent turns
   # Back pain - chronic spinal stenosis.
   - Vicodin 5/500 Q6HRS PRN Back Pain (home med)
   # Hypertension:  Held antihypertensives in setting of septic shock.
   Currently normotensive to mildly hypotensive.
   - monitor for now, add back as needed.  Norvasc 5 mg QD, Benzaepril 10
   mg QD.
   # FEN/GI: Speech and swallow consult showed poor swallowing function,
   suggests consider PEG placement for long term nutrition, currently
   swallow is poor and pt should only have small amounts of thickened
   fluids. NG tube was originally unusable for tube feeds as it was
   positioned high up in hiatal hernia, was repositioned by IR and is now
   appropriate for TFs.
   - replete lytes prn.
   - phos 2.1.  replete.
   - Colace/Senna/Bisacodyl PRN, hold for now with colitis and diarrhea.
   - continue TFs today w/ free water flushes.
   - GI consult regarding hiatal hernia and longterm planning
   - For his dry mouth, change to humidified air on scoop mask, continue
   swabs, and oral hygiene
   # Glycemic control: BS well controlled with SSI.
   # Lines: Right PICC line.  1 out of 2 ports can be drawn off.  Both
   open for infusion.
   # PPx: Heparin SC.  D/c
d protonix for increased risk of C. diff.
   # Communication: [**Name (NI) 200**] [**Name (NI) 1768**] (Nephew): [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1769**]
   # Code: DNR/DNI but could reverse if intubation likely to be temporary
   # Dispo: ICU for now, is being screened for rehab.
