Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 463**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis
Chemotherapy

History of Present Illness:
40 yo HIV+ male (diagnosed [**3309**], last CD4 366, VL 54,000, never
on antiretroviral therapy), ?HBV, who presented to the ED [**11-25**]
with a several day h/o abdominal pain worst in the RLQ, nausea,
vomiting, and SOB/DOE.  Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] states that these symptoms
appeared to begin abruptly, and denies any associated fever,
chills, or night sweats prior to admission.  An abdominal CT
scan performed in the ED incidentally noted a large pericardial
effusion.  He was noted on exam to have elevated neck veins,
tachycardia, and significant pulsus paradoxus.  Follow-up
echocardiogram demonstrated EF >55%, with 1.5-2.2cm
circumferential pericardial effusion with extesive stranding and
likely loculation, and RV diastolic collapse.  He was taken to
the cath lab for emergent pericardiocentesis, with drainage of
600 cc of serosanginous fluid and placement of drainage
catheter.  He stayed in the CCU until the drain was pulled, and
then was d/c'ed to the floor.

Past Medical History:
HIV diagnosed 1 year ago (patient requested blood test after
former partner found to have gonorrhea; STD screen negative at
the time, but found to have seroconverted).  Unaware of having
an acute retroviral conversion syndrome.  He reports negative
prior HIV tests, perhaps 2 years prior.  HIV RF is MSM.  No
opportunistic infections.  Has never been on antiretroviral
therapy.  CD4 counts reportedly between 300-400, and viral loads
reportedly between 50,000-100,000.
Hepatitis A
?HBV:  reports getting at least two vaccines for hepB after
contracting [**Last Name (un) **], and believes that subsequent studies may have
suggested HepB infection.

No IVDU.

Cytology: Numerous atypical and degenerated lymphoid cells are
present
  singly.

1.  Pericardial fluid cytospins (A):
          Primary Effusion Lymphoma (see note)
          Immunoperoxidase studies performed are not
contributory due to a high background staining.
Note: Primary effusion lymphoma is a form of high grade B cell
lymphoma confined to serosal cavities. It typically occur in the
setting of HIV infection, but can also be seen in other
immunodeficiency states, and presents with pleural or
pericardial effusions containing large anaplastic plasmacytic
immunoblasts which are typically negative for CD20 and CD79a but
positive for CD138. Typically there is no associated mass
effect.
2.  Cell block, pericardial fluid (B):
          Atypical degenerate plasmacytoid cells consistent with
necrotic primary effusion lymphoma (see note).

CT abd ([**11-25**]): Appendix measuring at the upper limits of normal
with likely wall enhancement related to phase of contrast.
There is a low suspicion for appeniditis given other features
including air in the lumen and lack of associated findings.
Recommend clinical correlation. Large paracardial effusion
associated pleural effusion, hepatic and venous congestion.
Periportal adenopathy.  Small amount of free fluid in pelvis.

CT chest ([**11-26**]): Interval decrease in size of pericardial
effusion following pericardial drain placement, with a
small-to-moderate amount of fluid persisting. Thickening of the
pericardium with evidence of enhancement, in keeping with
exudative effusion.  Increase in number but not size of multiple
mediastinal lymph nodes, with adjacent stranding of mediastinal
fat. These are nonspecific but may be inflammatory. Interval
increase in size of right pleural effusion.  Bibasilar
compressive atelectatic changes.  Nonspecific stranding of the
mediastinal structures.

ECHO [**11-26**]: Small pericardial effusion. No echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.

CXR [**11-28**]: Bilateral effusions; the left slightly smaller than
yesterday.

Brief Hospital Course:
1)Pericardial effusion: Because of his tachycardia, elevated
JVD, and RV collapse seen on echo, his effusion was drained
emergently in the cath lab, and he was monitored in the CCU
until the drain was pulled.  He never experienced any
hemodynamic compromise.  The fluid cytology was consistent with
Primary Effusion Lymphoma.  This lymphoma is associated with
HHV-8, but the sample that was sent to the micro lab to test for
this was lost.  He was evaluated by the Oncology serivce, who
recommended chemo.  He received one dose of chemo (liposomal
daunorubicin), which he tolerated well.  Tumor lysis labs were
checked and were normal, and he was given allopurinol.  His
pulsus paradoxus was monitored and was normal.  He had no
evidence of reaccumulation of the pericardial fluid.

2)Pleural effusions: These were seen on initial CT, and were
monitored by CXR.  They were decreasing on size prior to d/c.
He denied shortness of breath, and his oxygen saturation was
normal on room air.

3)ID:  He was begun on HAART per ID recommendations
(emtricitabine, tenofovir, and kaletra).  His PPD was negative.
His CD4 count was 200, and his viral load was 46,400.
