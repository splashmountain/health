Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Rheum c/s and recs: Doesn
t believe GI presentation is lupus related,
   only lupus manifestation currently is renal related.
   1. Recommend a GI consult for EGD/colonoscopy for bowel
   visualization and biopsy as needed
   2. Continue infectious work-up including stool studies,
   evaluation for C. diff, and other enteric pathogen
   3. Empiric antibiotic coverage for enteric pathogens
   4. Recommend further evaluation for falling hematocrit and
   platelet, including reticulocyte count, haptoglobin, fibrinogen,
   PF4 antibody, iron studies, B12, folate, stool guaiac
   5. Please check anticardiolipin IgG, anticardiolipin IgM, and
   anti-beta2-glycoprotein.
   6. If possible to perform by reversing heparin, please ask lab to
   perform a lupus anticoagulant assay. (may not be able to correct
   for presence of Coumadin or heparin)
   7. Please check for titers of dsDNA & levels of CH50, C3, and C4
   8. If patient is refusing PO prednisone 4 mg qd, please provide
   equivalent IV dose of Solu-Medrol 4 mg qd to prevent patient from
   developing symptoms related to adrenal insufficiency.
   Surgery recs: Bowel rest, NPO. Occult blood positive (trace) If HCT
   drops, will need NGT lavage.

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo F with ESRD, malignant HTN, started PD earlier this week,
   presented with N/V/D, abd pain, and hypertensive urgency.
   # Nausea/Vomitting/Diarrhea/Abd Pain: Abd pain increasing, N/V/D
   resolving. DDx: Infection: c. diff colitis (Cx pending), peritonitis
   (PD catheter in place and source of infxn), viral gastroenteritis, SBP
   (unlikely as PD fluid Cx shows NGTD and without leukocytosis); and
   Ischemia: h/o thrombotic events and SLE vasculitis (ischemia unlikely
   given low lactate).
   - Appreciate surgery recs.
   - Continue supportive care
   - Serial Abd Exams
   - F/u Stool Studies
   - Continue Flagyl empirically
   - Will guaiac stoolsx3
   - Heparin gtt for treatment of possible thrombotic ischemia.
   - Dilaudid for pain management
   - Re-assess peritoneal dialysis fluid today to re-assess PD-induced
   peritonitis.
   # Hypertensive urgency: O/N SBP <150 after started on PO meds
   yesterday, however, SBP increased this morning [**1-12**] pt did not take PO
   meds last night and [**1-12**] increased abd pain.
   -          Continue labetalol gtt. consider placing pt back on PO meds
   if pt can tolerate. SBP goal of <150.
   -          Pain control with Dilaudid
   # Hyponatremia: Na decreasing 135
130; LOS Fluid Balance: +2.2L;
   Etiologies include GI losses, CRF.
   - D/c IVF
   -Recheck lytes tomorrow.
   .
   # ESRD: Likely [**1-12**] SLE.  Estimated GFR is 8mL/min. Cr increasing,
   currently at 8.1
   - PD dialysis today if pt is able to tolerate.
   - Will follow renal recs.
   .
   # Anemia:  HCT of 35.0
21.5 from baseline of in mid 20s. Normocytic.
   LDH elevated. Etiologies include ACD [**1-12**] CRF
   -          Check H&H this afternoon
   -          Crossmatch for 2units and consider transfusion
   .
   # Decreased Bicarb:  Bicarb on admission continues to remain low at 13,
   baseline 16-20, AG 14
   - Will get VBG to assess acid base status
   .
   #OSA: pt unable to tolerate CPAP.
   -Continue to encourage CPAP at night to help OSA and also HTN.
   -F/u with outside PCP for OSA [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u.
   #Hypocalcemia: Ca decreased at 6.5
   -Continue Calcitriol and Calcium carbonate.
   # H/O Venous Thrombosis: warfarin 2mg qd at home. INR 1.2 on arrival,
   last INR 1.4
   -          Heparin IV gtt; continue warfarin home dose
   -          Follow INR with daily coags
   .
   # SLE:  Possible etiology of GI symptoms includes vasculitis.
   -Cont. prednisone 4mg home dose; Will check prednisone level.
   - C/s rheumatology to assess if SLE maybe source of GI symptoms.
   .
   # FEN: NPO. Replete lytes prn.
   .
   # ACCESS: PD cath, PIV.
   .
   # PPx: Heparin gtt, holding bowel regimen
   .
   # CODE: FULL
   .
   # COMMUNICATION: patient, mother [**Name (NI) 4859**] [**Name (NI) **] (works at [**Hospital1 52**]).
