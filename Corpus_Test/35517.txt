History of Present Illness:
77-year-old woman with known aortic stenosis and aortic
insufficiency as well as mitral regurgitation and mitral
stenosis presents with worsening CHF symptoms.  She is well
known to your practice and has been followed by you closely with

and evidence of pulmonary hypertension.  She does complain
significantly of dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and increasing
fatigue.  She does deny any angina or syncope.


Past Medical History:
Aortic stenosis/insufficiency, mitral
stenosis/regurgitation(most likely rheumatic), hypertension,
elevated cholesterol, atrial fibrillation, stroke with mild
right-sided weakness, and osteoarthritis.  She has undergone a
hysterectomy and had a St. [**Male First Name (un) 262**] pacemaker placed in [**2784**].

Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] is retired.  She has a remote tobacco history.  Her
last dental examination was five months ago.  She also denies
use of any alcohol.  She is currently living with her husband.


Family History:
Noncontributory

Physical Exam:
On examination, her heart rate is 60 and irregular, respiratory
rate 18, blood pressure on the right 154/64 and on the left
153/60.  She is 68 inches tall weighing 225 pounds.  She is in
no apparent distress.  Skin was unremarkable as well as the
HEENT examination.  Neck was supple with full range of motion.
Lungs were clear bilaterally.  Heart was irregular in rate and
rhythm with a mixed II/VI diastolic and systolic murmur. Abdomen
was soft, nondistended, and nontender with positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities were warm and well perfused with 1+
peripheral.  No obvious varicosities were noted. Neurologically,
she is grossly intact with mild right upper extremity weakness.
She has 2+ plus bilateral femoral pulses and radial pulses and
1+ bilateral DP and PT pulses.  The systolic murmur transmits to
both carotids.

[**2796-2-19**] Intraop TEE:
PREBYPASS
1. The left atrium is markedly dilated and is elongated. A
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest. Mod to severe left atrial contrast is noted.2. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 3.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and descending
thoracic aorta. 5. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened with some calcification. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area <0.8cm2) by continuity equation, area 1.1 by
planimetry which is likely inaccurate due to calcification.
Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 6. The
mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. The
mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity. There is
mild mitral valve prolapse of the anterior leaflet and
restriction of the posterior leaflet.. There is moderate
valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2). Mild mitral
regurgitation is seen.

POSTBYPASS
1. Patient is on no infusions and is being paced at 80 2. A
tissue mitral valve is seen. It is well seated and functioning
well. Trace central MR jet is seen, NO perivalvular leaks. Peak
gradient 13, mean gradient 4 3. A tissue aortic valve is seen.
It is well seated and functioning well. No periventricular leaks
are noted. Peak gradient 11, mean gradient 5 4. Aortic contours
are smooth after decannulation

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] was admitted preoperatively for intravenous heparin
and preoperative workup. Electrophysiologic interrogation of her
permanent pacemaker revealed that she was pacemaker dependent
with an underlying rhythm of 40 beats per minute, irregular and
with prolonged pauses. The remainder of preoperative course was
uneventful and she was cleared for surgery.  Given inpatient
stay was greater than 24 hours prior to surgery, Vancomycin was
given for perioperative antibiotic coverage. On [**2-19**], Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] performed aortic and mitral valve replacements, along
with Full Maze procedure. For surgical details, please see
operative note. Following surgery, she was brought to the
cardiovascular intensive care unit for invasive monitoring.
Within 24 hours, she awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without incident.  Her permanent pacemaker was
interrogated.  She was weaned from her pressors and her chest
tubes and wires were removed.  Coumadin was started given that
she has a history of atrial fibrillation and she underwent a
MAZE procedure.  She was transferred in stable condition to the
surgical step down floor.  Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] was aggressively
diuresed.  She was seen in consultation by the physical therapy
service.  By post-operative day three she was deemed ready by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for discharge to an acute care facility for further
diuresis and rehab.
