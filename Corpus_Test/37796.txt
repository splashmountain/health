Brief Hospital Course:
Following transfer she remained pain free and was begun on a
Heparin infusion. On [**11-19**] she was taken to the Operating Room
where revascularization was performed.  See operative note for
details.  She tolerated the operation well and weaned from
bypass on neosynephrine and propofol in stable condition.  She
was weaned from pressors and extubated without difficulty.  CTs
were removed on POD 1 and pacing wires on day 3.  Beta blockade
was resumed and she was diuresed towards her preoperative
weight.

She transferred to the floor and was seen by Physical Therapy
for mobility and strength.  Wounds were healing well at
discharge.  Restrictions, medications and follow up were
discussed with her.  A rehabilitation facility was utilized at
discharge to further allow her recovery before returning home.
