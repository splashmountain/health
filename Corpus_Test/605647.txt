   Assessment and Plan
   58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, ascites and
   portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be apneic with
   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU with multi organ failure, now slowly improving.
     >Aspiration and Hypox Respiratory failure:  new b/l infiltrates and
   temporal history consistent with aspiration event now growing out
   enterobacter cloacaein the sputum with CT [**5-19**] showing significant
   multifocal PNA with no evidence of cavitation.   Will cont support
   ventilation. He conts to have significant aspiration of gastric
   secretions.  Picture now complicated by volume overload and renal
   failure.  High  PEEP requirements overnight [**1-19**] ascites, volume and
   multifocal PNA, he has been gradually (slowly improving
   - Vanco and meropenem, Vanco by level  for empiric coverage and
   Meropenem for MDR enterobacter ([**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) 938**])  (D1 = [**5-19**] for Meropenem)
   (D1= [**5-11**] for Vancomycin) for planned 14 day course.
   - Trial PS today and see how he does.
    > Leukocytosis:  Seems that he likely has a worsening multifocal PNA,
   no evidence of new peritonitis or bowel (no evidence of pfocal
   obstruction. Cont broad spectrum Abx (rise in WBC may have been in part
   [**1-19**] steroid).
   - Continue coverage multifocal PNA as above, stop flagyl [**5-24**])
    > Illeus: on CT, now off Fentanyl. Reglan trial [**5-22**] with no
   improvement, added erythromycin [**Date range (1) 9117**] and s/p 4L paracentesis , now
   slowly improving (tolerating PO and had BM)
   - cont care as above
   - Add back lactulose
   - Stopped erythromycin.
   > Hypotension: ? early sepsis from aspiration event on the back drop of
   liver failure and illeus.  No evidence of bleed. Previously requiring
   two pressors, able to be weaned off (and also got started on
   hydrocortisone which seemed to facilitate the weaning of pressors.
   - Cont  hydrocortisone (D1=[**5-21**]) for 5 day course last day [**5-26**].
    -Off NE (aim for MAP > 65)
   - Cont supportive fluid
   - trend Hct (slowly drifting down).
   > Renal failure: Cr trending up from baseline 1.3 with little urine
   output, based on exam of  urine appears more consistent with ATN.
   hypotension. No evidence of hydro on renal US.  [**5-23**] Cr worse with
   concern that we may precipitate HRS by doing the para (despite giving
   albumin), with improvement  with albumin challenge. Will trial gentle
   diuresis today.
   - follow urine bladder pressures (have been in [**6-25**] range)
   - Gentle diuresis with albumin today.
    > Anemia: worsening Hct but no evidence of active bleeding at this
   point, could be dilutional from renal failure
   > Liver failure with Esoph Varices: recent GI bleed no evidence of
   underlying encephalopathy as a an etiology
   - back on  lactulose/rifax [**5-24**]
   - supportive therapy for coagulopathy
   > Encephalopathy: multi factorial including hepatic enceph with no
   ability to deliver lactulose, renal failure, toxic-metabolic, sepsis.
   Cont to follow serial exams.
