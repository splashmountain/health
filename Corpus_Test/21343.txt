Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 419**]
Chief Complaint:
Increasing shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2527-4-25**] Aortic Valve Replacement(21mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 657**] Mechanical Valve)


History of Present Illness:
This is a 65 year old female with recent increase in exertional
dyspnea with moderate activity. Workup was notable for
mod-severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.9 cm square
with a peak gradient of 52 and mean gradient of 38 mmHg. LVEF on
echocardiogram was 67%. Subsequent cardiac catheterization
revealed normal coronary arteries. Based on the above results,
she was referred for cardiac surgical intervention.

[**2527-4-28**] Head CTA: The posterior fossa structures are
unremarkable. The cerebral parenchyma has normal [**Doctor Last Name **] and white
matter differentiation. Slightly prominent ventricles and
extra-axial CSF spaces are noted, consistent with age
appropriate involutional change of the brain parenchyma. There
is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift
of midline structures. The osseous and the soft tissue
structures are normal. Bilateral intracranial, internal carotid,
anterior and middle cerebral arteries are patent and normal in
caliber. Bilateral vertebral, basilar, and posterior cerebral
arteries are patent and normal in caliber. No evidence of
aneurysm is apparent and there is no evidence of stenosis or
occlusion of the vasculature.

[**2527-4-29**] ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left  ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). A bileaflet aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is normal for
this prosthesis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve is not well seen. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.

[**2527-4-30**] Spine CT Scan: No evidence of cervical spine fracture or
abnormal alignment. Moderate degenerative changes


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 34714**] was admitted and underwent routine preoperative
evaluation. Workup was unremarkable and she was cleared for
surgery. On [**4-25**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] performed aortic valve
replacement utilizing a St. [**Male First Name (un) 657**] mechanical valve. For further
surgical details, pleas see seperate dictated operative note.
Following the operation, she was brought to the CSRU for
invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, she awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated without incident. Early postop, she
developed atrial fibrillation which was treated with Amiodarone,
betablockade and Heparin anticoagulation. K and Mg levels were
monitored and repleted per protocol.

On postoperative day three, she was noted to have significant
right-sided weakness. Heparin was promptly discontinued and head
CT scan was performed. Head CT scan showed no evidence of
infarction or bleed. The neurology service was consulted and
suspicious for small embolic subcortical infarctions. Head MRI
was preferred but unable to obtain secondary to obesity/body
habitus. Additional studies included echocardiogram which was
unremarkable(see result section). Given that the head CT was
negative, heparin anticoagulation was resumed and Warfarin
anticoagulation initiated. Over the next several days, her
neurological deficits improved and she eventually transferred to
the SDU on postoperative day five. She continued to work with PT
to help improve her activity level and was medically ready for
discharge to a rehabiliatation facility on post-operative day
seven.
