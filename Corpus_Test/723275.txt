   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo F w/ CAD, ischemic [**Month/Year (2) 5254**] (EF 10%) s/p [**Hospital1 **]-V ICD, atrial
   fibrillation, CKD, with past history of DVT and PE on Coumadin who was
   recently discharged from the CCU ([**1-1**]) for CHF exacerbation c/b
   C.diff infection, admitted from OSH with septic shoulder joint (MRSA)
   and hypoxia, requiring intubation.
   # Hypotension: low BP requiring pressor support with dopamine .
   Etiology likely multifactorial shock from sepsis (MRSA bacteremia and
   septic shoulder/ MCP) and cardiogenic with EF of 10%. On RV
   catheterization [**1-17**]; CVL > 17 suggesting that hypovolemia is not
   playing significant role in hypotension
   - use dopamine to maintain adequate MAP > 60 to preserve adequate
   Cardiac Output
   - increased abx frequency to  vancomycin 1gm q 24hrs, check vanco
   trough
   - source control with left shoulder/ hip washout/ aspiration
   # Septic Joint:  Patient with +staph aureus in left shoulder, left hip
   and right MCP.  S/p washout of shoulder and MCP and aspiration of left
   hip on [**3425-1-20**]
   - continue Vanc
   - possible left hip washout tomorrow
   - continue to hold coumadin (on heparin gtt) pending further surgical
   intervention
   # Bacteremia: OSH blood cultures positive today for GPC in
   clusters/pairs, likely MRSA with likely source septic glenohumeral
   joint.  No evidence of endocarditis on TEE yesterday, although atrial
   thrombus may be infected.  PICC  line placed at OSH replaced yesterday
   with central cordis.
   - continue IV Vanc
   - cont daily surveillance with 2 sets of  cx until negative
   # CORONARIES: Patient with h/o CAD w/ right dominant system, mild
   instent re-stenois of the LAD BM stent and occluded RCA.  No evidence
   of ischemic event precipitating cardiogenic shock
   - con Simva 20mg and ASA
   - on telemetry
   # PUMP: Patient with h/o ischemic [**Last Name (LF) 5254**], [**First Name3 (LF) 281**] 10%, s/p BiV ICD ([**Company 2322**]
   Concerto C154DWK) [**2-19**].  As above, admitted with symptoms of
   cardiogenic shock with volume overload .  Currently hypervolemic after
   OR with 2 U FFP and 1.5 L fluid
   - strict I/Os  with aggressive diuresis as tolerated by BP
   - daily weights
   - continue Lasix to maintain urine output
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient currently extubated after OR today,
   maintaining adequate saturation on NC.  Likely some degree of pulmonary
   edema from hypervolemia.  Initial respiratory failure likely secondary
   to mucus plugging and underlying CHF. Pt has sputum Cx with GPC in
   pairs, but no evidence of PNA on CXR.
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - stat CXR
   - cont lasix gtt to remove excess fluid
   # RHYTHM: Patient with h/o atrial fibrillation, s/p BiV ICD ([**Company 2322**]
   Concerto C154DWK) [**2-19**], intra-atrial thrombus on TEE.  On Amiodarone
   for antiarrhyhmic and heparin gtt for anticoagulation.  Patient paced
   on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 167**] obtain ECG to compare with previous ECG.
   - cont home Amiodarone
   - hold dig (supratherapeutic level 2.6) while on dopamine
   - continue  heparin gtt
   - hold coumadin given possible further surgical intervention
   # Acute on CRF: Patient w/ baseline Cr 1.3-1.8, 2.4 on presentation.
   Likely related to CHF. FEUrea 35%. Now at baseline.
   -          monitor Cr
   -          - avoid diuresis
   # H/o DVT/PE: Patient has h/o DVT/PE currently on heparin gtt and has a
   [**Location (un) **] filter in place.  Has known clot in her LA. Supratherapeutic
   INR, now improved to therapeutic range of 2.8.
   - cont heparin gtt
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue Levothyroxine.
   # Allopurinol:  Patient on Allopurinol, unclear why.
   # FEN: encourage po. replete lytes PRN
   # ACCESS: right IJ triple lumen
   # PROPHYLAXIS: heparin gtt
   # CODE: DNR/ DNI
   # DISPO: CCU for now
