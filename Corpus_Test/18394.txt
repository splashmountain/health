History of Present Illness:
48 y/o asymptomatic male with h/o atrial septal defect,
ventricular septal defect and mitral regurgitation discovered in
[**3288**]. He was seen in cardiology consultation in [**9-23**] after the
patient's pcp discovered cardiomegaly on CXR. He had repeat
echocardiogram which revealed the onset of right heart failure
and pumonary hypertension, along with previous findings in [**3288**].

Physical Exam:
Gen: WDWN male in NAD
Skin: W/D intact
HEENT: NCAT, EOMI, PERRL, OP benign
Neck: Supple, FROM -JVD
Heart: RRR with holosystolic murmur
Abd: SOft, NT/ND +BS
Ext: Warm, well-perfused -edema
Neuro: A&O x 3, MAE, non-focal

Pertinent Results:
[**1-24**] CXR: The cardiomegaly is unchanged. The post-sternotomy
wires are stable as well as the repair device. Compared to the
previous radiograph, there is slight increased engorgement of
the vessels with unchanged appearance of the basal atelectasis
and bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. There
are no new areas of consolidation, worrisome for pneumonia.
[**1-15**] Echo: Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the
left atrial appendage. A left-to-right shunt across the
interatrial septum is seen at rest. A large secundum atrial
septal defect is present. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is a moderate sized
pericardial effusion. Unable to demonstrate a VSD, although the
membranous septum is attenuated, and appears abnormal. Post-CPB:
The patient received a patch ASD repair, VSD repair, and a
mitral valve repair and a mitral ring annuloplasty. On no
pressors or inotropes, A-Paced. There is a trace of residual
inter-atrial flow at the level of the cardiac cushion. There is
a trace of MR, and trace to 1+ TR. No VSD is apparent. RV
systolic fxn remains mildly depressed. LV systolic fxn remains
mildly depressed. Aorta intact, and trace AI remains as
pre-bypass.
[**1-21**] Echo: The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function
(LVEF>55%). There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow
tract obstruction. There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. A mitral valve annuloplasty
ring is present. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a small
pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Compared with
the prior study (images reviewed) of [**3291-7-12**], the previously
seen primum ASD appears to have been repaired with a patch.
There is no residual shunt across the defect. The degrees of
mitral and tricuspid regurgitation have decreased - both are now
only mild. The right ventricle appears less dilated and less
hypokinetic. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures
are now normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient firstname 184**] was a same day admit after undergoing all
pre-operative work-up as an outpatient. On day of admission he
was brought directly to the operating room where he underwent a
atrial septal defect repair, closure of VSD, and mitral valve
repair. Please see operative report for surgical details.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. On
post-op day one he appeared to be doing well and was transferred
to the telemetry floor for further care. On post-op day two his
chest tubes were removed. Also on this day he had heart rhythm
issues, including 2 degree AV and complete heart block. On
post-op day three a HIT panel was sent d/t decreasing platelets.
EP was also consulted d/t rhythm issues with plan for pacemaker.
Also hematology consulted on Mr. [**Known patient lastname 4837**] this day for his
thrombocytopenia. HIT panel was negative and thrombocytopenia
thought to be medication induced. He remained stable with
epicardial pacing wires intact until pacemaker was placed. He
did have rise in temperature which delayed the placement of the
pacemaker by several days. He worked with physical therapy and
passed an ETT without incidence and therefore a PPM was not
placed but will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 299**].
