   Assessment and Plan
   47 yo F with recurrent admissions fot line associated bacterimia now
   presenting with severe back pain and sepsis requiring pressors.
   .
   # Sepsis/ hypoension/ fevers: likely line sepsis in this woman with
   chronic central venous access.  No clear focal neuro deficits, although
   cannot r/o diskitis at L4/L5.  Despite down-trending WBC, high-grade
   fevers & hypotension poorly responsive to fluid requiring pressors
   highly suggestive of sepsis. Line is the most likely cause given her
   history,but cannot rule out disciitis and would apreciate further ID
   and NSGY input on diagnosis and mgt. Urinary tract could also be
   source.
   - cefepime 2gm IV bid (no h/o ESBL), and daptomycin 6mg/kg IV daily
   (h/o MRSE bacteremia, allergic to vancomycin)
   - blood, urine, cultures
   - trend wbc and temp
   - aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - levophed to maintain MAP>60
   - RUQ US normal and biliary tree now unlikely infectious source despite
   high Tbili.
   - tagged read cell scan over CT guided Bx for discitis w/u
