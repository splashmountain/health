   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt to cath today.The LAD was highly calcified, and had a 90% ostial
   lesion with diffuse disease throughout the mid-portion of 90%.  The LCX
   was tortuous and was without any angiographically apparent disease.
   The RCA was calcified and had a 60% stenosis in the mid-portion.
   Elevated left and right sided filling pressures. No intervention. Catch
   check was normal. Diuresing well, negative 3L as of 9:30 pm. Gave
   another 20 IV Lasix at midnight. Added Lisinopril to start in AM
   This AM, patient reports feeling well; no CP, palpitations, sob or

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo F with sudden onset of SOB on Sat night, worsening DOE, found to
   have ST elevation MI.  Taken to cath yesterday, found to have 90%
   mid-LAD disease and 60% stenosis of mid-RCA.
   .
   # Coronaries: STEMI, cath as above showing disease in LAD and RCA, but
   tortuous vessels not amenable to intervention
   - ASA 325
   - Plavix 75
   - atorvastatin 80
   - Continue Diuresis with goal 1-2 L out daily, with 20 IV Lasix q6h
   .
   # PUMP: in failure/shock currently, treatment as above. TTE [**8-6**] showed
   dilated LA, mild LVH, severe LV systolic dysfunction with near akinesis
   of distal [**1-7**] ventrical.  EF 20-25%, no masses or thrombi.  RV with
   focal hypokinesis of apical free wall, [**12-6**]+ MR.
   - Dopamine if hypotensive (SBP<90), low UOP, or worsening failure
   -continue heparin ggt given diffuse apokinesis seen on echo
   -metoprolol on, will titrate up
   -lisinopril added this am
   .
   # RHYTHM: was in A fib on initial presentation, currently in sinus.
   - metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
 would increase to 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   -Started Lisinopril 5 mg daily this AM
   -continue telemetry monitoring, EKGs
   .
   # inflamation: elevated WBC and temp, found to have dirty U/A
   - 2 day course of Cipro completed ([**Date range (1) 8521**])
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # Asthma: Intermittent wheezing on exam
   -continue prn albuterol nebs
   .
   # S/p recent cataract surgery: continue home cipro, prednisolone and
   acular eye drops
