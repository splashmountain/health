s/p arrest

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 14937**] is a 71 yo M with PMH significant for CHF (EF:
20-25%), CAD s/p CABG, CKD, a-fib on coumadin, s/p ICD, presents
after VF arrest.  Per the family the patient had been complaing
of dizziness over the last few months.  He does have a history
of VT per the wife with 2 episodes of syncope in [**Month (only) 1811**]. They
also state that he has just not been himself over the last few
months since he was cardioverted for his a-fib. He has been
having frequent falls and syncopal episodes.  He has been
closely followed by his cardiologist who had been titrating his
medications including d/c spironolactone and decreasing his
lisinopril.  He reportly underwent cardiac cath 3 months prior
that showed occluded grafts, but collateral flow, no
intervention was performed.  He had been having worsening
function and unable to perform daily activities because of
dizziness.  Today the patient was walking to his bedroom when he
had a syncopal episode. His wife heard him fall and raced to his
side and called 911. EMS arrived within 5-7 minutes and he was
found to be in he was found to be in VF arrest and was shocked
twice with return of spontaneous circulation.  He was taken to
[**Hospital1 6935**].

At [**Hospital1 6935**] ECG showed a LBBB. Cardiac enzymes: MBI 2%,
Trop 0.16 and Cr. 6. Patient was intubated and sedated with
propofol.  He was started on dopamine gtt for hypotension SBP
70-90s and lidocaine gtt. ABG: 7.35/37.8/340/20.8 on Tv:500,
RR:14, FiO2:60%, PEEP: 3. The patient was transferred to the
[**Hospital1 22**] ED.

In the ED: T: 97.8 BP: 87/62 HR: 118, the dopamine was stopped
and he was started on levophed 0.15mcg/kg/min and neo
2.5mcg/kg/min in the ED.  He was continued on lidocaine gtt
4mg/min and given 1mg versed and 50mcg of fentanyl.  A code
STEMI was called and given ASA 325mg and plavix 600mg.  Upon
review the ECG that showed LBBB and discussion with the family
regarding his PMH it was decided that he would not be cathed and
would pursue medical management. CE: Trop 0.16 CK: 521  MB: 13
MBI: 2.5. INR 3.9, WBC 15.3, Cr 5.3, Gap 20.  He had a CT-head
that did not show acute abnormality and CXR that showed
pulmonary edema.

The patient was transferred to the CCU and cooling protocol was
initiated.

Unable to obtain ROS.

IMAGING:
[**12-12**] ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is borderline
dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral akinesis. There is
moderate to severe hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF
<20%). The estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The right
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free
wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal diastolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume
overload, as well as a conduction abnormality or RV apical
pacing. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is at least
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, athough this may be
underestimated given severity of TR. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe regional and
global systolic dysfunction, c/w prior extensive inferior
myocardial infarction and a superimposed process (or multivessel
CAD). Markedly dilated right ventricle with severe global
systolic dysfunction. Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral
and tricuspid regurgitation. Depressed cardiac index and at
least mild pulmonary hypertension.

[**12-12**] CXR:
ETT balloon hyperinflated. Low lung volumes, with possible mild
vascular congestion. Moderate cardiomegaly.

[**12-12**] CT head:
No acute intracranial abnormality. No intracranial hemorrhage
or loss of [**Doctor Last Name 14**]-white matter differentiation.

[**12-13**] CXR:
Development of pulmonary edema and left basilar atelectasis or
consolidation and possibly pleural fluid

[**12-15**] CT head:
1. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, edema, large masses,
mass effect, or large vascular territory infarction.
2. Mucosal thickening in bilateral maxillary sinuses and
sphenoid sinus.
3. Interval increase in opacification of the right middle ear
and mastoid air cells.
4. Lipoma is noted within the right occipital region, unchanged
from prior.
5. Coiling of NG tube within the nasopharynx.

[**12-18**] CXR:
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Left transvenous pacemaker
leads terminate in a standard position in the right atrium and
right ventricle. Left IJ catheter tip is in unchanged position
in the left brachiocephalic vein. Right central catheter tip is
in the right atrium. Small bilateral pleural effusions, larger
on the left side associated with atelectasis are unchanged.
Difference in density in the bases is consistent with difference
in redistribution of the pleural effusions. There is mild new
pulmonary edema.  Right lower lobe opacity could be atelectasis,
but pneumonia cannot be excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 14937**] is a 71 yo M with PMH significant for CHF (EF:
20-25%), CAD s/p CABG, CKD, a-fib on coumadin, s/p ICD, who
presented after VT arrest.

#. VT Arrest: The patient was brought in s/p shock x2 by EMS for
VT. The rhythm was unclear at first and thought to be VF, so the
patient was initiated on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun. He
was intubated and sedated for several days. CT head and EEG were
negative for intracranial events. The patient's ICD was
interrogated, and it was found that he had several episodes of
slow VT during the past few weeks that were below the threshold
for pacing by his ICD. His pacer was reset to detect VT as a
lower heart rate, but he continued to have episodes of VT
despite Amiodarone, Lidocaine, and several shocks by his ICD as
well as externally.  The patient was made DNR/DNI by his family
on [**3186-12-18**]. He passed away at 10:55am on [**3186-12-19**] with his
family by his bedside.

# CORONARIES: The patient was continued on ASA 325mg and Lipitor
20mg. BB and ACEi were held [**2-3**] to hypotension.

# PUMP: Pt with severe CHF. He was dialyzed with CVVH x 2 days.

#. Resp Distress: Pt was intubated for airway protection in the
setting of VT arrest. Patient likely volume overloaded from CHF
and pulm edema on CXR. He also developed VAP and was treated
with Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro for 7 days.
