24 Hour Events:
   - CHF c/s for monday
   - Plan to remove Swan on monday. CI 3.7 up from 2.7 on saturday.
   - day [**12-22**] nafcillin
   - Coffee ground emesis G + 11 am ; d/cd coumain and heparin. Placed NG
   tube with 200 cc output to low suction. Hct stable 28.9 > 27.4 > 27.2
   without transfusion.
   - I/O - Goal 1-2 L negative. Continues to diurese well on Milrinone and
   Lasix gtt. Neg. 1.9 L at 1800. Noted to be tachycardic at 2200 and dry,
   so tapered lasix gtt from 15 mg/hr to 5 mg/hr
   - Persistent nausea despite Zofran. D/cd Compazine, dulcolax for
   concern of worsening ileus. Made npo.
   - Noted leukocytosis with Am labs [**5-26**]. Added C diff, LFTs.
   - Summary: Stable overnight. NGT placed after coffee-ground emesis,
   200cc output to low suction but had persistent nausea on zofran, so
   made NPO
 Hct stable. KUB ordered for this AM to assess for ileus. I/O
   goal achieved yesterday (1-2L neg), because of tachycardia at 2200,
   tapered lasix gtt 15
5. CXR ordered this AM for fluid status, CHF c/s
   today, CI up to 3.7. Still on milrinone.

   Assessment and Plan
   64M with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS s/p
   aortoplasty, rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH
   with DOE, transferred for further evaluation of AS and found to have
   MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock
   # Chronic systolic heart failure:  The patient
s signs of fluid
   overload (lower extremity and dependent back edema, crackles) are
   better today than previously and his net fluid status yesterday was
   -2L.  However, his BP has been falling somewhat (MAPs in 50s now) and
   HR is increasing (up to 110-120s). This suggests that he is either
   over-diuresed, this is a reaction to his medications, or worse he is
   septic (WBC was 24 this AM). We will need to be cautious with him
   throughout the day and monitor his hemodynamic status.
   -          Cont milrinone at 0.5 mcg/kg/min
   -          d/c digoxin b/c of renal failure
   -          Cont lasix at 5 mg/hour, increase today if necessary to
   maintain fluid goals
   -          Goal fluid status -500cc
   -          Continue Metoprolol 12.5 mg po bid, to decrease that high HR
   -          Continue to monitor hemodynamics
   -          Goal MAP>60
   -          Wedge today was 24.
   -
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Rate is getting high, still in afib. Will
   potentially need cardioversion in the future, which might even improve
   his cardiac output (thus decreasing the need for milrinone). If we
   decide to do cardioversion sooner than 3 weeks, we may need an echo to
   check for clot to prevent stroke.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Beta-blocker for rate control, as above
   - heparin and coumadin d/c
ed because of hematemesis
   # Leukocytosis. [**Month (only) 11**] need more aggressive antibiotics if his status
   deteriorates, but at this time we will watch. We sent him for UA, UCx,
   BCx, CXR (negative for PNA), and C.diff.
   - f/u labs
   # Hematemesis. Resolving. D/c NGT today.
   -          IV PPI
   # Pulmonary hypertension:  Pulmonary pressures elevated out of
   proportion to what would be expected with aortic stenosis alone.
   Patient with known severe COPD. Has body habitus concerning for OSA as
   well, although has not be desaturating at night. Pulmonary consult
   service following; will weigh in again once patient is more euvolemic
   given that PCWP is still elevated.
   -          Pulmonary recs
   # Aortic stenosis:  s/p aortoplasty with minimal improvement in valve
   area. Transaortic pressure gradient did improve by 30mmHG. Once more
   medically stabilized, he may be a candidate for AVR.
   # MSSA bacteremia:  Unclear source; surveillance culture remain
   negative.
    - Continue Nafcillin for 2 week course (day #1=[**3310-5-13**], day
   #14=[**3310-5-27**])
   .
   # Liver failure:  Transaminitis resolving, synthetic function
   improving. Likely [**2-10**] shock liver
   - Avoid hepatotoxic medications
   - Tylenol 2gm max/24 hrs
   .
   # ARF:  Creatinine trending down to 1.1, which suggests that the
   decrease in his GFR previously was due to poor forward flow and renal
   vein congestion (i.e. pre-renal ARF).
   -          Expect improvement as milrinone helps forward flow
   -          Closely monitor creatinine as we have increased Lasix gtt
   # Anemia
 Hct stable; unclear baseline; recent GIB w/ C-scope showing
   colonic AVM that was cauterized
   -          Trend hematocrit
   -          Guaiac stools
   .
   # Low back pain:  Presumed [**2-10**] chronic lumbar back disease, but will
   monitor for evidence of complication of bacteremia (epidural abscess)
   - Tramadol
   - Tylenol
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Stable. Likely a component of shock, liver
   failure, and bone marrow suppression from his bacteremia.
