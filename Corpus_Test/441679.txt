   83M s/p [**2578**]4 hours ago.  He was ambulating with his
   walker when he lost his balance and fell hitting the left side of
   his chest on the edge of a table or chair.  No LOC, he remembers the

   tired.  He called his PCP who told him to go to the ED to be
   evaluated.  He does report left sided chest pain similar to his
   angina symptoms and shortness of breath.  He does have a history

   as 1 unit pRBCs.
