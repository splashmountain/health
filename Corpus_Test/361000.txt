   Assessment and Plan
   HYPOXEMIC RESP DISTRESS- underlying infectious process (see below) +
   pulm edema given low EF and + fluid balance yest
   -gentle diuresis for neg fluid balance
   -infectious mgmt as below
   PROBABLE PNEUMONIA- DDx includes viral syndrome, CAP, aspiration, as
   well as atypicals, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   [**Name11 (NameIs) 7481**] isolation for r/o TB given chronic history, high-risk social
   situation
   -influenza DFA
   -empiric coverage for CAP
   -send sputum for gm stain, cx, PCP DFA
   [**Name9 (PRE) 4967**] bronch for infectious workup; will dicuss w/ patient and plan
   tentatively for am tomorrow if INR better, O2 reqt ok. NPO p MN.
   -speech and swallow eval
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE- prerenal by history, labs, resolving w/ fluid
   resuscitation
   HIV- not on HAART [**12-21**] poor compliance
   -would cont PCP prophylaxis at least
   -cont fluconazole for oral candidiasis
   APLA- supratherapeutic on coumadin
   -hold all anticoag for now. s/p vit K yest and today, monitor for any
   sign of downtrending Hct or clinical bleeding
   -monitor INR
   CARDIOMYOPATHY- EF 25-30%
   -cont BB, ACE-I, digoxin, held for now
   -gentle diuresis as above for goal TBB neg 500/day
