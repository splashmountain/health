   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - diuresis off 3-4 L via CVVH
   - s/p trach by surgery, during the transfer multiple lines were
   disturbed (A-line, swan, CVVH line).
   - CXR - swan displaced, pulled back, replaced with a triple lumen.
   - Replaced A-line to left arm.
   - lost her wound vac suction cup - temporary fixed, need vascular to
   reevaluate.
   - went into afib while pulmonary suctioning at 1:30am, dropped her MAP
   to 50's, placed on phenylephedrine, pushed 5mg IV metoprolol x3, then
   put on dilt gtt, converted by to sinus while turning at 3:30am.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo F c HTN, DM, HLP p/w acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Neuro: Spontaneous opened eyes and moved hands with lactulose despite
   fentanyl @100 and.  Patient was grimacing to suction and pain.  However
   her sedation had to be re-started given her disynchrony with the vent.
   Appears to be more responsive after weaning off sedation.
   - watch for mental status improvement
   - continue lactulose titrate to 4 BM/day
   .
   # Cardiovascular: Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around
   territory. S/P BMS to LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more
   hemodynamically stable. Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor
   cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9), now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed
   gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of
   compartment sx in LLE.  Reached goal CVP >12 for [**Year (4 digits) **] resuscitated.
   in NSR/sinus tach but had an episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off
   temp pacer at this time.  last TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient
   had been on heparin gtt but stopped [**1-5**] bleeding concerns.  Off
   pressors and tolerated -2L yesterday.  s/p an episode of atrial
   fibrillation, converted back to sinus without BB.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - will check hemodynamic profile q8 hours today
   - f/u AM CXR
   - CVVH negative I/O as tolerated, diuresis with pressors if need
   - CK daily
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 42**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status is hindering the process
   of weaning.  Tolerated short course of pressure support, however tired
   out and required A/C.  Continue sedation holidays, pressure support
   trials.
   - pressure support trial
   - s/p trach continue try to wean.
   - take off more [**Last Name (Titles) **] as tolerated to facilitate extubation.
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having large BMs with Lactulose.  NGT found
   to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per GI.
   Had melenotic/frankly bloody bm [**10-7**], put on IV PPI.
   - continue IV PPI
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   .
   Melena/bloody BM
 suspect Oozing in the setting of DIC, ?[**1-5**] gastritis
   or stress ulcer in the setting of vented patient only on H2, patient
   had
explosive
 BM o/n which was not frankly bloody.  Hepatic
   dysfunction contributing to this picture.
   - Per GI consult IV PPI started, hold TF for now
   - VSS, NG lavage clear, no acute bleeding
   - IV protonix does NOT interfere with plavix
   - Giving vit K, FFP, f/u on INR
   - BM regimen
   - get TPN for nutriention, PICC placement.
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   required CVVH.  Urine output now improving, 310cc yesterday with -2L on
   CVVH
   - Bicarb has improved greatly with new [**Numeric Identifier **] cocktail
   - f/u Renal recs re: CVVH
 monitor lytes (Ca, phos)
   - resolving hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (can give bicarb in D5W
   if need)  - on CVVH.
   - f/u UOP, given elevated CVP, normal SVR will continue to run
   negative.
   .
   #ID:  patient had a markedly elevated WBC, but now improving (34->29.6
 24.8
 14.8).  CT of abd was negative, CT of sinus showed collection
 low suspicion (see ID note in OMR).  Patient currently being treated
   for Klebsiella PNA (culture positive on [**9-30**]).  Per ID recs, this
   could be explained by inflammatory response [**1-5**] necrosis of leg tissue
   + Klebsiella PNA.  No empiric fungal treatment warranted at this time.
   C Diff negative
   - f/u cultures, vanco lvl
   - on cefepime (since [**9-30**], currently D9), vanc (since [**9-30**], currently
   D9), flagyl (since [**10-2**], currently D7) of presumed 14day course
   - id signed off
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy is likely [**1-5**] chronic DIC/hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.   Hold addl FFP,plt transfusion as it may worsen DIC
   picture, would give FFP if necessary, and cryo as needed, vit K
   - Transfuse prn again this PM if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct >
   30.
   - Transfuse FFP if INR continues to rise or bleeding continues, goal
   INR < 1.5
   - appreciate and follow - heme-onc regarding the
   anemia/thrombocytopenia.
   - monitor DIC labs.
   .
   # compartment sx
 Likely developed [**1-5**] IABP use.  IABP now removed,
   patient s/p LLE fasciotomy.  Wound VAC placed.
   -    followed by Vsurg
  wound VAC
 input appreciated
   -    serial pulses, CK

   # Elevated LFTs: Markedly elevated. Likely shock liver and rhabdo.
   -  trending

   # IDDM

   # HTN: Hold home hypertensive regimen until more HD stable.
