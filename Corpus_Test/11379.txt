HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 year-old
woman that fell fourteen feet from her porch onto her left
side with questionable loss of consciousness.  The patient
was worked up at an outside hospital and transferred to [**Hospital1 1205**] for further management of
multiple trauma.  Her multiple trauma included a subarachnoid
hemorrhage with intraparenchymal blood.  A C2 transverse
foramina fracture, left 5th, 6th and 7th rib fractures,
aortic laceration versus dissection.  The patient had CT
angiogram, which confirmed aortic dissection without
extravasation.  Portion of a right tibial plateau fracture,
which is old versus new.  The patient had negative right knee
film and negative right tibia fibula films.  The patient has
left clavicle fracture.  Left ankle negative for fracture and
the patient has a left scapular fracture.

On [**10-31**], the patient required 3 units of packed red blood
cells.  She had a repeat CT of the chest, which showed blood
in the chest and with aortic disruption and intraparenchymal
bleed in the spleen.  The patient had a chest tube placed on
[**3149-10-31**] for hemothorax.  On arrival to the CICU the
patient was belligerent and uncooperative.  She moved all
extremities.  Bilateral grasp strong and unable to follow
commands or answer questions.  She had a C collar in place
and remained on log rolling precautions.  She was loaded with
Dilantin.  She had no evidence of seizure activity.  The
patient had an arteriogram to delineate the aortic
dissection.  During the procedure the catheter broke off in
her artery.  She was taken emergently for a cut down to have
that removed.  That was done successfully and there were no
complications from that.

The patient was extubated on [**10-31**].  She was awake, alert and
oriented times three and moving all extremities strongly.
She had periods of confusion on and off with periods of
agitation.
