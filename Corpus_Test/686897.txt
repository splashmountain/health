Chief Complaint: 76F with phmx HTN transferred from OSH after syncope
   episode and chest pain, cardiac cath showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD
   stenosis. POBA LAD and LCx with VT s/p shock twice in cath lab,
   intubated for respiratory distress, dopamine for hemodynamic support.
   Hypothermia protocal was initiated after patient presents self cooled
   and in coma. On [**3-3**] became bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT
   arrest. Received a tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to
   partially in the RA causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. Removal of
   ECMO and tandem heart. Continues to have pressor requirement. Improved
   mental status. Trach placed. Now s/p PCI with stent to left main,
   jailed LAD with balloon expansion with good flow.
   24 Hour Events:
   - thoracic surgery signed off, wont do PEG until off pressors
   - increased midodrine, lowered beta blocker to [**Hospital1 **]
   - CODE BLUD - The patient had decreased urine output, clamped down.
   Became progressively hypoxemic. Then became bradycardic and severely
   hypotensive. Pulses lost and CPR was initiated. PEA arrest for 1 cycle
   was given epinephrine and atropine given. Started on 4 pressors (neo,
   levo, dopa, vasopressin). Regained pulse which was then lost again,
   restarted compressions and again got epi and atropine. PEA arrest again
   for 1 cycle. Bedside TTE showed mod/severe MR, mod/severe TR with
   adequate LV function. Femoral A-line was placed in sterile fashion. ABG
   shows pH of 6.95 and lactate of 11. Patient given bicarb and started on
   bicarb drip. Meropenem and vancomycin started. A bronchoscope was
   performed to eval for upper airway obstruction. A femoral TLC placed in
   sterile fashion.
   - lasix 80IV and lasix drip given with goal of I=O
   - Patient made DNR (pressors okay, NO ACLS MEDS, NO SHOCKS)

   Assessment and Plan
   76F with HTN transferred from OSH after syncope and chest pain. CCath
   showed 95% LMCA and 99% LAD stenosis. POBA was done with VT s/p shock
   twice in cath lab. The patient was intubated and pressors were started
   for hemodynamic support. Arctic sun protocol was initiated. On [**3-3**] PEA
   to VT arrest. Tandemheart in cath lab, with in line ECMO. s/p removal
   of tandemheart and ECMO. Trach placed. s/p PCI with BMS to LMCA, jailed
   LAD. [**3-25**] PEA arrest x2.
   #. Shock: unclear etiology. Likely cardiogenic plays component but
   distributive picture also likely a factor as well. Was on
   phenylephrine. Started midodrine in attempt to wean. Yesterday became
   hypotensive and bradycardic, s/p PEA arrest. Concern for  Was on
   midodrine, phenylephrine, dopamine, levophed, vasopressin for pressure
   support. Once code complete and patient more HD stable were able to
   wean some pressor requirement. Trend lactate.
   - cont levophed
   - wean phenylephrine as tolerated
   - cont midodrine for now
   - cont vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] (day 1 [**3-25**])
   - attempt I = O
   - trend lactate, pH
   - trend LFTs
   - trend WBC, T
   - TTE today
   - consider ENT consult to eval for sinus source
   - consider swan
   #. Metabolic acidosis: elevated lactate to 12. Now trending down. Had
   to give multiple bicarb pushes and started bicarb drip.
   - trend ABG
   - trend lactate
   - continue pressor support
   #. Acure kidney injury: Cr from 1.1 to 1.8 to 2.4. Trend concerning for
   kidney injury. Urine output minimal now.
   - continue pressor support
   - lasix gtt, metolazone, attempt I=O for now
   - consult renal - may need CVVH in future
   - trend BUN/Cr
   - urine lytes, urine sediment
   #. Transaminitis: Likely secondary to shock liver from hypotension. [**Month (only) 8**]
   be leading to distributive picture. INR elevated suggesting some
   synthetic dysfunction.
   - trend LFTs
   - consider hepatology consult
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to pulmonary edema
   secondary to acute congestive heart failure, although hemorrhage,
   aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on differential.
   - monitor I/O goal even
   - continue lasix gtt and metolazone if tolerated
   - trach stitches can be removed - will be done by CT Surgery at time of
   PEG placement
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue sedation
   #. Coronary artery disease:  Patient is s/p STEMI and cardiogenic shock
   after PEA arrest.  s/p PCI [**3-18**] of LMCA.
   - continue plavix, aspirin, statin
   - decrease beta blocker
   - continue heparin gtt for apical akinesis - watch hct
   #. Anemia: CT torso without evidence of intraabdominal bleed.  Has had
   guaiac + stools. Tandem heart, which appeared associated with anemia,
   has been removed.  Bronch clean.  On heparin drip. Hct stable.
   - will monitor Hct
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Has been recurrent and intermittent.  Had
   another episode of atrial fibrillation overnight.
   - continue amiodarone po
   - consider beta blocker withdrawal
   - continue heparin gtt
   #. Neurologic status: Unclear after newest PEA arrest. Will attempt to
   lighten sedation and assess today.
   - will continue to follow her clinical exam
    # Nutrition: Readdress this afternoon if stable.
   - NPO for now since recent PEA arrest
   # Hyperglycemia: hyperglycemic - secondary to D5W in bicarb drip.
   Should now improved.
   - ISS - adjust prn
   # Insomnia/ Depression:   Ambien works well intermittently.  Patient
   needs rest to help w anxiety
   - continue ambien
   - continue citalopram
   # Goals of care
 DNR - do not use ACLS or shock, pressors okay
