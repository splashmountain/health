   Assessment and Plan
   58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, ascites and
   portal gastropathy with recent UGIB.  Found today to be apneic with
   respiratory arrest and likely aspiration s/p intubation and transferred
   to the MICU.
   # Resp. failure:  Most likely etiology is aspiration event and
   subsequent respiratory arrest given patient was found in vomitus and
   gastric contents suctioned post-extubation.  CXR slightly improved but
   may be due to increased PEEP.  Was already being treated for possible
   asp. PNA with vanc/meropenem (day 1 [**5-19**] of [**Last Name (un) 411**]) x 10 days, day 1
   [**5-11**].  Unfortunately ABG was unable to be obtained during code so
   unclear how hypoxic patient was, however oxygenating well currently.
   - Continue vancomycin / meropenem
   - Change to dexmedetomidine for sedation
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   - Daily wake-up, RSBI
   - check ABG after A-line placement
   - f/u sputum culture
   # Leukocytosis: with bandemia.  Consider aspiration pneumonia, SBP,
   intraabdominal abscess, translocation of gut flora due to ileus,
   c.difficile
   - f/u culture data
   - pan culture today
   - send c. diff today
   - continue current abx
   - add po vancomycin and IV flagyl for empiric C. difficile
   - diagnostic para today
   - CT chest/abdomen/pelvis today with po/PR contrast
   # Hypotension
   [**Month (only) 56**] in part relate to sedatives. Sepsis also clearly a concern.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Changing to dexmedetomidine
   - CVL to better measure CVP
   - Cont. pressors
   # ARF: DDx includes pre-renal from overdiuresis, ATN from hypotension.
   Given cirrhosis must also consider hepatorenal syndrome or abdominal
   compartment syndrome.
   - f/u renal U/S
   - Hold diuretics
   - if renal function worsens, continue to check bladder pressures
   - f/u urine lytes
   - Follow Cr/urine output
   - Talk with renal re ?midodrine and octreotide
   - d/c standing albumin (less likely HRS)
   # Anemia: on [**5-6**] showed severe portal gastropathy and grade II
   varices. The patient is s/p banding x4. Hct 26 down from low 30s on
   admission.  [**Month (only) 56**] be dilutional vs. hemolysis vs. slow UGIB
   - urine hemosiderin if hapto low
   - f/u hemolysis labs today
   - active T&S
   - transfuse
   - IV PPI
   - check 1 PM Hct
   - ? octreotide if 1 PM Hct does not remain stable
   - d/c SQ heparin if 1 PM Hct low
   - transfuse for Hct <23 or active bleeding
   #. Ileus: Diagnosed on CT.  Decompressed with NGT and had resolved on
   recent KUB which was negative for obstruction.  Abdomen mote tense and
   tympanic today concerning for obstruction. [**Month (only) 56**] have been inciting event
   for aspiration on the floor.
   - surgery following, appreciate their input
   - OG tube to low wall suction
   - NPO
   - CT abd/pelvis with po/PR contrast
   # EtoH Cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, varices with
   recent UGIB.  LFTs improving. Encephalopathy management as above.
   - hold lasix/spironolactone given borderline BPs
   - cont Pentoxifylline
   - cont to trend LFTs
   # Hepatic Encephalopathy: Mental status was stable on floor, slowly
   improving. Lactulose was restarted, no stools here.
   - change to lactulose enemas
   - cont rifaxamin
   - d/c standing albumin
   # Coagulopathy: INR stable at 1.9 Secondary to EtOH cirrhosis. No signs
   of bleeding.
   - Trend coags
   # Diabetes type II:
   - continue home insulin regimen
