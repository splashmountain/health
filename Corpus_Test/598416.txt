   Assessment and Plan
   24 year old female with ESRD on hemodialysis, SLE, malignant
   hypertension, history of SVC syndrome, PRES who presents with abdominal
   pain and shortness of breath admitted to the ICU for hypertensive
   emergency.
   Hypertensive Emergency:  Patient's blood pressure did not normalize in
   the emergency room with administration of her home blood pressure
   medications and she transiently required a nitroglycerin and labetalol
   drips.  Likely precipitated by lack of ultrafiltration at dialysis
   yesterday.  She has not received dialysis and her blood pressures are
   at her baseline off the drips.
   - continue home blood pressure regimen
   - Nifedipine  150 mg Tablet SR daily
   - Hydralazine  100 mg Tablet Q8H
   - Labetalol  1000 mg Tablet TID
   - Aliskiren  150 mg Tablet PO BID
   - Clonidine  0.2 mg/24 hr Patch Weekly
   - Hydralazine 100 mg PO PRN for SBP > 200
   - discontinue IV drips
   - continue regular dialysis schedule
   Chronic Abdominal Pain: Currently managed with PO dilaudid, fentanyl
   patch and lidocaine patch.  Prior authorization paperwork for fentanyl
   was sent during last admission and is pending.

   - continue lidocaine patch
   Lupus Erythematous:  Complicated by uveitis and ESRD.
   - continue prednisone
   ESRD:  On dialysis.  Did not receive ultrafiltration yesterday but
   received today.
