   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 71 y/o man with PSC complicated by cirrhosis with known
   esophageal varices presenting with melenotic stools and hct drop.
   .
   # GI bleeding: EGD performed on arrival to the ICU demonstrated cherry
   red spots (stigmata of recent bleeding). Two varices were banded during
   EGD.
   - appreciate liver input and prompt EGD
   - continue octreotide gtt
   - protonix 40 mg iv bid
   - maintain active type & cross
   - 2 18g pivs
   - serial hcts (2 u given on arrival to [**Hospital1 **], next hct with AM labs at
   0400)
   - cipro for sbp prophlyaxis in setting of variceal bleeding
   - reverse coagulopathy for INR ~ 1.5 (got FFP 2 U with procedure,
   repeat with AM labs)
   .
   # Hypotension: Related to blood loss as above. Received a total of 6 L
   NS (4 l at [**Location (un) 1375**] and 2 L here on arrival) in addition to total of 3 U
   prbcs. Arterial line placed by Liver team prior to endoscopy with SBPs
   ~ [**9-22**] points higher than cuff pressures.
   - continue to trend Bps, stabilized for now
   - use PRBCs preferably if hypotensive
   - hold spironolactone and nadolol until stabilized
   .
   # PSC with cirrhosis: Has PSC which caused cirrhosis.
   - needs paracentesis in AM to eval for SBP, empirically covered for now
   with ciprofloxacin
   - add on LFTs to labs sent on arrival
   - restart ursodiol when able to take POs
   - continue lactulose in AM when able to take POs
   - for cirrhosis, will hold spironolactone/lasix for now given
   hypotension
   - discuss with Liver RUQ drain and role for replacement (just replaced
   last admit)
   .
   # Leukocytosis: WBC up to 20 with left shift. No fevers as of yet.
   Cover with ciprofloxacin for SBP as above. Could also reflect stress
   from GI bleeding. Continue to monitor.
   .
   # elevated blood sugar: Likely related to D5 infusion (?). Sliding
   scale insulin with fingersticks four times daily for now.
   .
   # MEtabolic acidosis: Likely related to bicarb losses in diarrhea
   today. Continue to trend. Check lactate with AM labs.
   .
   # anemia: Related to GI bleeding as above.
   .
   # Ulcerative colitis: Restart mesalamine in AM when able to take POs.
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG: Had recent stress test with fixed defect along anterior
   wall and septum.
   - restart statin in AM when taking meds
   - send cardiac enzymes with AM labs, if positive likely demand in
   setting of hypotension & anemia
   - hold aspirin for now until bleeding stabilized
   .
   # Depression/ADHD: Restart sertraline and ritalin when able to take
   POs.
   .
   # FEN: npo for now with sips, clears in AM if no signs of further
   bleeding, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: pneumoboots, no need for bowel meds currently, [**Hospital1 **] ppi.
   .
   # ACcess: 2 18 g pivs, arterial line (right)
   .
   # CODE: full, confirmed with wife
   .
   # COMM: with patient and wife, [**Name (NI) 6918**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6919**]
   .
   # DISP: icu care until stable hct
