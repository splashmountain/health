 [**Last Name 113**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   This is a 24 yo male with type I DM, ESLD on HD, resistant HTN who
   presents with hyperglycemia and emesis and found to have significantly
   elevated blood pressures.
   .
   # Fever/Mental Status Changes/? delirium: Pt is was not speaking to
   medical staff yesterday but today he is. However, he seems to be
   laughing and crying anappropriately. Pt
s mom says pt does not usually
   cry while hospitalized. He does have a history of oppositional defiant
   disorder. Was agitated and confused on admission. It is difficult to do
   a neuro exam or get a sense of his mental status right now as he is not
   cooperating. Head CT read neg for any acute IC process.  Still concern
   for infection as febrile on admission, cultures negative and on broad
   spectrum Abx. Pt does have history of TTP, but platelets not low. [**Month (only) 56**]
   also have had some component of uremic encephalopathy.
   - correct glucose and electrolyte abnormalities
   - 1+ schistos on peripheral smear.
   - HD today
   - psych following
   - neuro would like MRI, unable to get last night [**12-23**] pt unable to
   follow commands and nsg concerned for safety alone c pt as he is very
   labile
   -LP shows no meningitis by cell counts. Initially on
   vanc/ceftriaxone/acyclovir empirically pending cultures. vanc and
   ceftriaxone dced. would continue acyclovir until negative pcr
   -tsh wnl
   # Hyperglycemia: Would be classified as HHS given no ketonemia, though
   AG present. Possible etiologies include infection vs insulin
   non-compliance. AG resolved after only 10 units of IM regularinsulin
   with serum glucose ranging <70 to 200
s over past day.
   - check FSBS q2 hours
   - [**Last Name (un) 257**] following- on lantus 4 units daily and [**Last Name (un) 257**] sliding scale
   and conservative sliding scale
   - blood, csf, and urine cxs to rule out infection
   .
   # Hypoglycemia: low BS this am. got [**11-22**] amp D50. ? whether insulin
   should be decreased. Will f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) 10034**] [**Last Name (un) 257**] recs.
   .
   # Hypertension: BP 200's/100's on admission. Has run similarly high on
   previous admissions. Attempting to titrating meds to SBP's in 150's.
   However, still elevated.  BP goal 160
   -had significant trouble c BP control yesterday. continue all home meds
   and consider adding additional meds prn. currently written for
   labetolol drip prn if sbps >180.  DC-ed metoprolol, now on clonidine
   patch and labetolol 300 [**Hospital1 **], Norvasc, and lisinopril increased to 40.
   Hydralazine DC-ed.

   # ESRD on HD: HD on [**7-27**], took off 800cc.
