   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse,  CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection, subsequent long hospital course with
   respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post tracheostomy on
   TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and klebsiella in the
   urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to explain recent
   fevers and hypotension..

 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH) - s/p tracheostomy: on TM again today. We
   performed a trach change [**10-8**] but he still is requiring high cuff
   pressures and occasionally has a leak. He may need a longer trach.
   - continue pulmonary toilet, will perform bronchoscopy if secretions
   are copious.
   >Hypotension: concern for evolving SIRS/sepsis as well as over diuresis
   - Will liberalize I/O
   - Fluid boluses as needed
   - Intermittent  norepinephrine as needed for MAP > 60 mmHg.
   > Hyponatremia: possible a reflection of fluid shifts (likely [**1-1**]
   hypovolemia.). This may be SIADH vs now volume overload. He may need
   free water restriction. Will check urine lytes as he has become
   progressively more hyponatremic. UNa is 69 which argues for SIADH. He
   appears  normovolemic (and is also getting free water from the IV
   bactrim which we can change to PO )
   - Urine lytes to help guide therapy.
    > Leukocytosis and Fevers: ESBL Klebsiella  and acinetobacter from
   sputum and Klebsiella (of similar resistance pattern)  in urine which
   appears to be an ESBL as well. [**10-6**] = Day 1 Meropenem. Blood cultures
   (including perip and PICC) have been negative on multiple assays.  He
   has multiple sites of skin break down including left knee cellulitis,
   toe gangrene and Achilles tendon break down all of which are largely
   stable at this point. He has been treated more recently for this
   cellulitis with daptomycin.   Notably negative for c. dif.  Over the
   last two days his WBC has cont to improve.
   - Meropenem ([**10-6**]) day 1 for 14 day course for GNR urine, Klebsiella
   and Bactrim (changed to IV) for acinetobacter (pending [**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) **] on
   sputum sample)
   - [**10-8**] empiric gram positive coverage given hemodynamic stability.  He
   has a linez and Vanco allergy. He has a remote hx of coag neg staph
   [**8-30**] and recently empirically treated for left sided cellulitis with
   many areas of profound skin ulceration.  Will need to follow renal
   function closely.  CK ok on daptomycin
   - We will need to perform thoracentesis to further evaluate the left
   sided effusion , the CT report reads as "loculations" whichif true
   would necessitate a pig tail catheter

 HEART FAILURE (CHF):
   - liberalize I/O goals in the setting of his fevers and SIRs/Sepsis
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   - on fentanyl patch and oxycodone prn

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   - hold metoprolol in the setting of sepsis

 PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE (PVD) WITHOUT CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA
   - continue wound care, f/u vascular surgery as outpt
    Other issues per ICU resident note.
