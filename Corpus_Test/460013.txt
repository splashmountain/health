   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo F c HTN, DM, HLP p/w acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Neuro: Improved this AM on HD.  Consistent with uremia as source for
   prior neurologic depression.
   Earlier reduction of fentanyl patch clearly helped MS, as did lactulose
   for a brief period.  She is currently off of lactulose and rifaxamin
   and hepatic encephalopathy is not thought to be contributing.  Classic
   picture of toxic metabolic, will likely clear with leg closure,
   increase HD clearance.
   -Passed Passy-Muir trial, making some recognizable phonation; continue
   as tolerated
   .
   # ID:  WBC has now completely resolved, fevers are low grade at best
   off tylenol. Early fevers [**1-5**] multiple nidi, including triple lumen,
   CVVH line, sacral skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being
   open and foley catheter.  Currently residual low grade fevers likely
   [**1-5**] chronic inflammation in leg.   After ABX stopped, afebrile so far.
   - Tissue debridement cultures showed yeast -?[**Female First Name (un) 439**] hearty growth
   after full course of diflucan is concerning for true infection
       - will treat with 3-4 weeks of mica or diflucan pending
   sensitivities
   - D/C Vanc and  Zosyn, if she spikes and decompensates ID recs were to
   start VANC, [**Last Name (un) **], CIPRO
   - (started [**10-27**]) mica 100 qd- await sensitivities of 4 week course
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   appears to be dialysis dependent.
   - Started HD [**10-24**] now tolerating off pressors
   - Tunneled dialysis catheter in place, will give blood with HD,
   - HD schedule
   - IR guided tunnel cath
   .
   # Respiratory distress:  Placed on vent monday with sedation for
   procedure.  Will wean as tolerated had been tolerating trach mask for
   increasing amounts of time, continue trach mask training
   - pressure support for now, trach mask as she wakes up
   - monitor fluid status and RR, continue trach mask with Passy-Muir
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy was likely [**1-5**] /hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.   She appears to be losing significant RBC
s through her
   leg.
   - had HCT drop to unit given in xfusion, inappropriate response to unit
   after.
   - Vitamin K given for rising INR, transfuse one unit today
   - transfused 2u last weekend with appropriate Hct increase
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - renal rec
 on epo, with Iron/Vit C
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having regular BMs off of lactulose.  Patient
   had pulled NGT on her own, OR PEG failed, plan for laporoscopic today.
   Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. Had melanotic/frankly
   bloody bm [**10-7**], put on IV PPI.
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - BM regimen, hold lactulose
   - IR guided doboff- post pyloric
   - Speech and swallow following with dobhoff
   .
   # compartment sx
 Likely developed [**1-5**] IABP use.  IABP now removed,
   patient s/p LLE fasciotomy.  Wound VAC placed.
   - per Vsurg: went to OR, debrided way too big to close, plastics would
   like to heal by secondary intention
   - serial pulses
   - Vascular and Plastics to have conversation re: follow-up and wound
   care.  ACE pressure dressing appears to have stemmed blood loss
   somewhat.
   - f/u Vascular recs re: outpatient follow-up, would like to try wound
   vac today
   .
   # IDDM
 insulin gtt, [**Last Name (un) **]-stim is negative for adrenal insufficiency.
   - d/c
d NPH [**Hospital1 **] and transitioned to lantus and ISS to uptitrate.
   - appreciate continued follow up by [**Last Name (LF) 291**], [**First Name3 (LF) 114**] try 8 units of lantus
   today
   .
   # Cholestatic LFT elevation
 Ms [**Known patient lastname 9092**] has had a rising alkaline
   phosphatase with a positive GGT and a relatively low AST/ALT.
     RUQ U/s is not suspicious for gallstone or acalculous cholecystitis.
   Alk Phos is falling, may represent passage of an old stone.
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Markedly elevated. Likely shock liver and rhabdo.
   Significantly downtrended since hospitalization.
   -          Now WNL
   .
   # Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory: S/P BMS to
   LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more hemodynamically stable.
   Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9),
   now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic
   / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of compartment sx in LLE.  Reached
   goal CVP >12 for fluid resuscitated.  in NSR/sinus tach but had an
   episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off temp pacer at this time.  last
   TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient had been on heparin gtt but
   stopped [**1-5**] bleeding concerns.  Doing well off pressors.  Converted to
   sinus with amiodarone and  BB.   Currently in and out of sinus tach,
   responsive to beta-blockers.
   - Continue ASA, plavix.
   - Now starting statin.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home hypertensive regimen until more HD stable.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia
 Holding statin in setting of rhabdomyolysis /
   transaminitis/acute illness.
   .
   # FEN: Pt pulled NG, restart feeds once dobhoff is placed, would
   appreciate bridle ring.
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   - DVT ppx if HCT stable
 SQ heparin
   - pain management IV fentanyl
   - bowel regimen (senna + colace), lactulose
   .
