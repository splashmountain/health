Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 173**]
Chief Complaint:
Dizziness and dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**3341-11-24**] Aortic Valve Replacement(23mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 262**] Epic Supra
Porcine) and Single Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(vein
graft to ramus intermedius).

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 31542**] is a 70 year old male with known aortic stenosis. He
admits to a several month history of worsening dyspnea. He
presented to outside hospital with several hours of dizziness.
He ruled out for myocardial infarction. Echocardiogram was
notable for worsening aortic stenosis with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) **] of 0.6 cm2
with mild to moderate aortic insufficiency. His ejection
fraction was normal at 65-70%. Cardiac catheterization confirmed
severe aortic stenosis while coronary angiography showed
significant disease in the ramus branch and first obtuse
marginal arteries. Given the above findings, he was transferred
to the [**Hospital1 22**] for cardiac surgical intervention.

Pertinent Results:
[**3341-11-22**] Trans-thoracic ECHO: The left atrium is moderately
dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with thinning/akinesis of the inferolateral wall and
hypokinesis of the inferior wall. The remaining segments
contract well (LVEF 45%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
<0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be quantified. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad.
[**3341-11-22**] Carotid US:
1. No significant stenosis of the right ICA.
2. Less than 40% stenosis of the left ICA.

[**3341-11-24**] Intraop TEE:
Pre Bypass: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic
aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-4**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post bypass: Preserved biventricular function LVEF 45%. Mid
inferior hypokinesis is unchanged. MR remains 1+. Aortic
bioprosthesis is insitu (#23 [**Doctor Last Name **]) Peak gradient 17, mean
gradient 5 mm hg. No perivalvular leaks or insufficiency. Aortic
contours intact. Remaining exam is unchanged. All findings
discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.

CHEST (PA & LAT)   Clip # [**0-0-**]
Reason: pleural effusions
Final Report
PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH

HISTORY: 70-year-old man status post AVR and CABG. Evaluate for
pleural
effusions.

COMPARISON: Chest radiograph from [**11-25**] dating back to
[**3341-11-21**].

FINDINGS: Small bilateral pleural effusions are present and
unchanged.
Bilateral pleural densities may be due to subpleural adipose
tissue or pleural
thickening. In the right apex, there is an ill-defined
spiculated nodule
which is either in the lung parenchyma or abuts the pleura. This
nodule is
unchanged since [**3341-11-21**].

The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG with
appropriately
positioned cerclage wires. The cardiac silhouette is normal in
size. The
aorta is mildly tortuous but unchanged. The hilar and
mediastinal contours
appear unremarkable. A Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed.

IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions with slight improvement
in the left
basilar atelectasis.
2. Right apical spiculated nodule will require further
investigation with
chest CT when the patient is clinically stable.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 31542**] was admitted to the cardiac surgical service and
underwent routine preoperative evaluation which included repeat
echocardiogram, carotid ultrasound and pulmonary function
testing - please see result section for details. He remained
stable on medical therapy. Prior to surgery, he was cleared by
the dental service. His preoperative course was otherwise
uneventful. Given his hospital stay was greater than 24 hours
prior to surgery, Vancomycin was used for perioperative
coverage.

On [**11-24**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed an aortic valve
replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. For
surgical details, please see separate dictated operative note.
Following the operation, he was brought to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated without incident. His CVICU course was
uneventful and he transferred to the step down floor on
postoperative day two. Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  The patient made excellent
progress with physical therapy, showing good strength and
balance prior to discharge.  He did require meclizine for
vertigo, which was diagnosed pre-operatively.  The patient
required supplemental oxygen throughout his post-operative
course. A blood gas was drawn on room air on [**11-29**] and
reavealed a PO2 of 49. He was diuresed aggressively and treated
with inhalers and his oxygenation improved with room air
saturations above 90% with ambulation.  There was a right upper
lobe nodule found on CXR and he had a chest CT which revealed
bullous emphysema and a right upper lobe pleural based mass
which could represent scarring, inflamation, or neoplasm.  He
was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 31544**] from thoracic surgery and will
follow up with him.  He should obtain a PET CT and head CT prior
to that visit.  He was discharged to home in stable condition on
POD#7.
