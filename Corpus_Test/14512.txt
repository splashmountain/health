age of 50 with a redo CABG at the age of 58.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Patient is a well-appearing
female in no acute distress.  Cardiac was regular, rate, and
rhythm, normal S1, S2.  Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, good
bowel sounds.  There is no edema in the extremities.  She has
good pulses bilaterally.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Carotid stenosis:  Patient is status post a right internal
carotid stent.  She tolerated this procedure well without
complications.  The patient was continued on her aspirin and
Plavix.  During this procedure, the patient was started on
phenylephrine for blood pressure control to maintain a
systolic blood pressure in the 140s.

Patient was monitored in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit
overnight.  The patient received fluid boluses approximately
1 liter, and was able to be successfully weaned from the
phenylephrine.  Patient's blood pressure remained stable
throughout the remainder of her hospitalization.

2. Blood pressure:  The patient was originally hypotensive at
the time of carotid stenting and transiently on phenylephrine
for blood pressure control.  With fluid boluses, the
patient's pressure came up.  The patient's blood pressure
rose in the morning of discharge in the setting of having her
antihypertensives held.  The patient had a blood pressure of
170s systolic that morning and was instructed to take
clonidine 0.1 mg on the night following discharge.  After
that, the patient will resume clonidine b.i.d. per Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **].  The patient will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for blood
pressure check in the days following discharge, and he will
resume further antihypertensives as blood pressure tolerates.

3. Neurologic:  The patient was evaluated by Neurology during
the carotid stenting as well as prior to discharge.  She had
no neurologic events, and was neurologically intact at the
time of discharge.  She had no complaints.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Carotid stenosis.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Aspirin 325 q.d.
2. Plavix 75 q.d.
3. Clonidine b.i.d.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient will follow up with her primary
care physician within two weeks.  She will call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on
the Monday following discharge with a blood pressure check,
and he will restart antihypertensives as tolerated.  In
addition, the patient will follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6053**] of
Neurology in one month's time.
