executive.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin causes knee swelling.

on 2 liters.  HEENT normocephalic, atraumatic, moist mucous

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Ventricular tachycardia.  The patient ruled out for MI
with peak CK being 377 on this admission.  Ruled out for MI
with three negative cardiac enzymes.  The patient was
continued on aspirin, metoprolol, Lipitor.  Plavix was
started.  Cardiac catheterization at this time showed no
culprit lesion, although a thrombus may have formed in the
old SVG and embolized distally.  The patient's MCA was found
with 40 percent disease and LAD with 80 percent mid-disease
with SVG to LAD, SVG to PDA with diffuse disease, SVG to RA
to OM patent and LIMA to diagonal to LAD patent.  EP was
consulted for the patient's ventricular tachycardia.
Secondary to VT with left bundle branch block and LAD, the
patient had an ICD placed.  Biventricular pacemaker was
unable to be put in.  The patient was monitored for 24 hours
and had no episodes of ICD being fired.  The patient's
ejection fraction was 20 to 25 percent.  EP recommended to
start amiodarone on the patient.  Amiodarone was started and
will need to be titrated as an outpatient.

2.  Hematology/oncology.  The patient has multiple myeloma.
